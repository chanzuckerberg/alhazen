Twenty-three eyes of 22 patients with acute CSC were compared with 20 eyes of 20 healthy controls. OCTA images (AngioPlex Ò , Zeiss) were recorded at baseline and follow-up examination and auto- matically quantified using an image-processing algorithm. Abnormal CC decorrelation signals (increased and decreased flow, IF and DF) were quantified using a custom image-processing algorithm. To analyze the spatial correlation between SRF and OCTA, CC signal heat-map images containing macular thickness informa- tion were used.\nResults : Choriocapillaris flow alterations were significantly more pronounced at baseline than at follow-up examination in patients with acute CSC and resolving SRF (IF: p \\ 0.002; DF: p \\ 0.003). The extent of SRF correlated signifi- cantly with the abnormal CC decorrelation signals when comparing baseline with follow- up examinations (IF: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005; DF: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001). In particular, the reduced OCTA flow signal in the area occupied by SRF at baseline disappeared at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.02). In comparison with controls, CSC patients with complete resorption of SRF continued to show a reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC ( p \\ 0.008). Conclusions : The temporospatial association between SRF and reduced OCTA signal from the CC demonstrates that fluid might be a signifi- cant confounder for OCTA analysis in patients with CSC. CSC patients with complete absorp- tion of the SRF at follow-up, however, show persistently reduced CC flow signals.\nKeywords: Artifacts; Central serous chorioretinopathy; Choriocapillaris; OCT angiography; Subretinal fluid\n\n\nAbbreviations\nD RT Difference in average retinal thickness between baseline and follow-up examination\nAMD Age-related macular degener- ation\nEnhanced Digital Features To view enhanced digital features for this article go to https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.9948569 .\nM.

It is characterized by localized subretinal fluid (SRF) which self- resolves in most of cases within 6 months [ 2 ]. The pathogenesis of CSC is still poorly under- stood. Recent studies suggest that choriocapil- laris (CC) endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary cause of the disease, leading to sec- ondary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dys- function [ 3 , 4 ]. While conventional imaging techniques such as fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography can only partially depict the CC, optical coherence tomography angiogra- phy (OCTA) enables the assessment and quan- tification of CC blood flow [ 5 ]. OCTA is a noninvasive technology that uses laser light reflectance of the surface of moving red blood cells to depict blood flow in the retinal and choroidal microvasculature [ 6 , 7 ]. This tech- nology has enhanced our understanding of microvascular alterations in various macular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degen- eration [ 5 ]. However, OCTA is a light source- dependent device with considerable limitations. Shadowing artifacts caused by media opacities [ 8 , 9 ] or superficial blood vessels blocking the detection of deeper vessels in the retina can compromise the analysis [ 10 ]. Similarly, pro- jection artifacts caused by traversing light reflected by deeper layers (e.g., RPE) can mimic a vascular pattern in those retinal layers and thus confound the analysis [ 11 ]. Since its introduction, several groups have used OCTA to investigate the CC in patients with CSC [ 12 – 19 ]. However, none of these studies provides follow-up data in acute CSC assessing the OCTA signal at the level of the CC when SRF is absorbed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the influence of SRF in the analysis of the flow signal from the CC via OCTA, and to describe the flow alteration after SRF absorption in acute CSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nStudy Design and Population\nThis longitudinal, cross-sectional, single-center observational case–control study was conducted in 22 consecutive patients with acute CSC (23 eyes). Only patients with classic acute CSC defined by a dome-shaped accumulation of central SRF, no pronounced RPE changes or RPE detachments, and symptoms lasting less than 4 months were included in the study [ 20 ]. Data from the baseline examinations of 17 patients were previously published by Cakir et al. [ 12 ]. Twenty age-matched and healthy participants with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 or better and no chorioretinal pathology served as controls. All patients consulted our clinic between 2016 and 2018. Follow-up examinations were performed individually according to the disease course. No study par- ticipant had any concomitant ocular disease with CSC, or prior ophthalmologic surgery or laser treatment. In particular, there was no evi- dence of acquired or hereditary macular disease. Patient characteristics including gender, date of birth, pre-existing conditions, initial diagnosis, previous treatment, and duration of symptoms were recorded. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the ethics committee of the University of Freiburg (application no. 561/16) and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls for the publication of this study and any accompanying images.\n\n\nOphthalmological Examination\nAll patients underwent a thorough ophthal- mological examination including measurement of BCVA, assessment of intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, and ophthalmoscopy after dilation with tropi- camide 1% eye drops. Additionally, all patients\nunderwent spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and fun- dus autofluorescence imaging (Spectralis HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). OCTA examinations were performed using the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . It uses full-spectrum spectral domain (SD-OCT) with a light-source wave- length of 840 nm, an A-scan rate of 68,000 A-scans per second, and an A-scan depth of 2.0 nm in tissue (1024 pixels). The built-in software was used to eliminate artifacts created from superficial vascular layers. Each patient underwent a 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan. For OCTA visualization of the CC layer, a 30 l m slab between 29 and 59 l m below the inner RPE was manually selected for each patient.\nAbnormal CC decorrelation signals were quantified using an image-processing algorithm programmed in R ( http://www.r-project.org ) as described previously [ 12 , 13 ]. Briefly, images were processed via a Gaussian blur and mor- phological hdome-operator, and the average grayscale value was determined. The threshold for the color-coding was calculated for each OCTA image using the averaged grayscale value of all pixels (brightness of pixel) plus (increased flow, red pixels) or minus (decreased flow, green pixels) a constant and predefined threshold value. Before quantifying the pixel counts, shadowing artifacts of the inner retinal vessels were manually removed from each image. The pixel counts were used for statistical analyses. The average retinal thickness of the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan was measured via the heat-map image containing macular thickness informa- tion obtained from the Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . To explore a possible longitudinal correla- tion between SRF alterations and the CC flow signal over time, the difference in average reti- nal thickness ( D RT) between baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination was correlated with the difference in increased and decreased OCTA flow signal.\nTo analyze the potential vascular change in the CC in the area previously occupied by SRF and with no SRF at the time of follow-up\nexamination, the color-coded CC images were aligned with the corresponding heat-map ima- ges. The area revealing macular thickness exceeding 450 l m was defined as the region of interest and automatically outlined by the software. Red and green pixel counts within and outside the area were recorded and used for comparison with the control group. For statis- tical analyses, the percentage of the area with decreased versus increased flow signal was used.\n\n\nStatistical Methods\nStatistical analysis was performed using Graph- Pad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare paired samples, and the Wilcoxon test was performed to compare unpaired samples. Bonferroni correction due to multiple compar- isons was included. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman’s R ) was used to deter- mine the relationship between SRF and OCTA flow signal. Data were considered significant at p \\ 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 23 eyes from 22 patients with acute CSC (male/female 19/3) and 20 eyes from 20 controls (male/female 10/10) were included in this study. The average age of the CSC popula- tion was 51.2 years (range 37–80), compared with 49.9 years (range 22–79) in the control group ( p = 0.93). The time from the first symp- tom to the first examination in our hospital ranged from 0 to 86 days (average 20.2 ± 29.6 days). After the initial diagnosis, 10 patients had been treated with eplerenone, whereas 12 patients had not been treated with any systemic or topical medication. Follow-up examination was performed 134 ± 112 days after baseline examination. In 13 eyes (12 patients), SRF was completely absorbed at the follow-up examination. Five of these patients had been treated with eplerenone, while seven remained untreated.\n\n\nLongitudinal Correlation Between\nSubretinal Fluid Alterations and the Signal of Flow of the CC Over Time\nIn the 19 eyes in which average retinal thickness was decreased at follow-up (BL: 334.5 ± 29.3 l m, FU: 298.9 ± 20.8 l m, p \\ 0.0001), we observed a significant reduction in CC alter- ations at follow-up compared with baseline examination (Fig. 1 a, b). The area of increased CC flow signal was 3.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline and 2.04% ( ± 1.1%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.002). Similarly, the area of reduced flow signal decreased from 2.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline to 1.10% ( ± 0.6%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.003). However, in the four eyes in which retinal thickness increased over time (retinal thickness at BL: 308.6 ± 11.7 l m, FU: 338.2 ± 26.8 l m, p = 0.08), we found no obvi- ous difference in the area of CC flow changes at follow-up relative to the baseline examination. The areas of both increased CC flow signal (2.5% ± 1.7%) and decreased CC flow signal (2.3% ± 2.2%) were similar between the base- line and follow-up examinations (3.8% ± 2.4% and 3.5% ± 3.3, p = 0.56 and p = 0.25). Inter- estingly, the area of diminished OCTA signal shifted below the center at follow-up examina- tion, which was associated with a downward shift of the SRF (Fig. 1 c, d). To explore the correlation between SRF and the OCTA flow signal of the CC, we correlated the difference in average retinal thickness on the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan between baseline and follow-up examination with the difference in detected OCTA flow signal from the CC. Using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test, we found that the extent of SRF correlated significantly with the CC flow alterations (de- creased flow: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001, increased flow: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005, Fig. 1 e, f).\n\n\nChange in the OCTA Signal\nfrom the Choriocapillaris After Complete Absorption of SRF\nTo analyze the OCTA signals in the CC follow- ing SRF absorption, 13 eyes presenting complete absorption of SRF at follow-up were evaluated.\nFig. 1 A decrease in subretinal ﬂuid is associated with a reduction in OCTA choriocapillaris alteration.

Decreased ﬂow\nLooking at the entire 6 9 6 mm 2 OCTA image, the OCTA signal alterations were greater at the baseline examination compared with the fol- low-up examination (increased flow: p \\ 0.028, decreased flow: p \\ 0.009) and with healthy controls (increased flow: p \\ 0.039, decreased flow: p \\ 0.039; Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). No statistically significant difference was found in the decor- relation signals between CSC patients without SRF and healthy controls when the entire image was analyzed. However, when looking at the area where the SRF was initially located, the decreased OCTA flow signal persisted and was significantly more pronounced than in healthy controls despite the absence of SRF ( p \\ 0.008; Fig. 2 e, Table 1 ). These data point toward local- ized CC changes that are spatially correlated with the area of SRF in acute CSC and persist in inactive CSC, independent of SRF. The detailed statistical results for the analysis of changes in the OCTA flow signal from the CC in patients with acute CSC after complete SRF absorption are listed in Table 2 .\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a promising noninvasive technique for imaging the microvasculature of the retina and choroid. However, artifacts occurring in OCTA, such as shadowing artifacts caused by intra- or subretinal fluid (SRF), may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [ 9 , 11 , 21 ]. In this longitudinal OCTA study, we demonstrate a strong temporospatial associa- tion between SRF and reduced OCTA signals from the choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with acute CSC, indicating that SRF might be a sig- nificant confounder for the OCTA analysis of the CC.\nSeveral studies have shown that the OCTA signal of the CC is reduced in patients with CSC, interpreted as reduced blood flow of the CC [ 14 , 16 – 18 ]. Although some authors have suspected that SRF contributes to the reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC in the sense of a shadow artifact [ 12 , 22 ], this could not be demonstrated due to lack of follow-up data. Our longitudinal study shows that CSC patients with complete absorption of SRF at follow-up demonstrate a significant reduction in OCTA flow alterations in the CC, indicating that SRF prevents the detection of OCTA signals from the CC. In line with this finding, patients with persistent and vertically displaced SRF at the follow-up examination exhibited a reduced OCTA signal from the CC in the affected area. These findings support the prevailing hypothe- sis that SRF is a disruptive factor in the analy- sisof CC via OCTA and that the quantitativeanalysis of CC flow changes in the presence of retinal fluid must be considered with caution [ 5 , 12 ]. This applies not only to CSC, but also to other retinal vascular diseases associated with subretinal or intraretinal fluid, such as neovascular age-related macular degen- eration (AMD). For example, in geographic atrophy in AMD, it has been assumed and his- tologically demonstrated that RPE atrophy is associated with CC atrophy [ 23 , 24 ]. CC OCTA studies, correspondingly, have shown decreased CC flow in areas of RPE atrophy [ 25 , 26 ]. Simi- larly, CC OCTA studies in patients with\nTable 1 Change in the OCTA ﬂow signal from the choriocapillaris in patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) after complete absorption of subretinal ﬂuid (SRF)\nCSC follow-up w/o SRF\nintermediate and subclinical exudative AMD have postulated the existence of CC signal voids [ 27 , 28 ]. Considering our results, especially in the description and quantification of CC signal voids in patients with neovascular AMD, intra- or subretinal fluid above this area must be excluded with confidence [ 29 ]. Further studies investigating this hypothesis are needed and must exclude any intraretinal or subretinal flu- ids which, as shown in this study, can signifi- cantly affect OCT CC and potentially even mimic CC signal voids.\nBy following up patients with acute CSC until the absorption of SRF, our study bypasses the above-mentioned shadowing effect of SRF on the OCTA flow signal, and a more reliable conclusion about possible vascular changes in the CC can be drawn. Interestingly, we found that the reduced OCTA signal in the CC per- sisted after SRF absorption, indicating a reduced blood flow in the CC in CSC patients that is spatially associated with the area of SRF. This hypothesis is in line with previous OCTA CC studies describing areas of low flow signal in CSC patients [ 12 , 15 – 17 ] which may indicate a thinned CC pushed upward by pachyvessels or low blood flow at the CC level [ 14 , 22 ]. Studies applying indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) support this assumption [ 4 , 30 , 31 ] and show delayed choroidal filling on ICGA at the site of the hot spot in 82% of CSC patients [ 32 ] and a 45% reduction in choroidal blood flow in CSC eyes compared with unaffected fellow eyes [ 33 ]. A comparison of OCTA and ICGA demonstrated that areas with coarse low-reflec- tive OCTA signal corresponded with the area of hypo-fluorescence on early-phase ICGA [ 22 ]. These studies support the findings of our study and indicate that CSC is associated with reduced choroidal blood blow.\nWe acknowledge that this study has some limitations, including its retrospective design and small number of patients. Although age- matched controls were used, we did not match patients regarding refraction or length of bul- bus, nor did we collect blood pressure or anti- hypertensive medication data, both of which might be confounders in our study. Although shadowing artifacts by SRF were excluded, arti- facts are potentially caused by RPE and\nphotoreceptor outer segment irregularities as well as RPE detachment [ 34 , 35 ]. Since pro- nounced RPE changes after one episode of acute CSC are mild and are not located exclusively in the area previously occupied by SRF, a shad- owing artifact on the OCTA flow signal from the CC of these RPE changes seems unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded. Another limitation of our study is the use of the averaged pixel intensity of each image to determine increased and decreased flow changes within the same image. Therefore, local, large deviations in the flow signal influence the average signal, which may have caused some over- and underestima- tion of flow changes. Prospective longitudinal studies with optimized image acquisition tech- niques less prone to artifacts are therefore nec- essary to further validate our findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, this longitudinal OCTA study reports follow-up data from patients with acute CSC during their initial episode of CSC until SRF was completely removed. Although we demonstrate that SRF is a distinct confounder when analyzing the CC via OCTA, we also reveal that the OCTA flow signal from the CC within the area previously occupied by SRF continues to be reduced after SRF has com- pletely resolved compared with that in healthy controls, indicating reduced blood flow in patients with acute CSC.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the participants of the study.\nFunding.

Twenty-three eyes of 22 patients with acute CSC were compared with 20 eyes of 20 healthy controls. OCTA images (AngioPlex Ò , Zeiss) were recorded at baseline and follow-up examination and auto- matically quantified using an image-processing algorithm. Abnormal CC decorrelation signals (increased and decreased flow, IF and DF) were quantified using a custom image-processing algorithm. To analyze the spatial correlation between SRF and OCTA, CC signal heat-map images containing macular thickness informa- tion were used.\nResults : Choriocapillaris flow alterations were significantly more pronounced at baseline than at follow-up examination in patients with acute CSC and resolving SRF (IF: p \\ 0.002; DF: p \\ 0.003).

In particular, the reduced OCTA flow signal in the area occupied by SRF at baseline disappeared at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.02). In comparison with controls, CSC patients with complete resorption of SRF continued to show a reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC ( p \\ 0.008).

It is characterized by localized subretinal fluid (SRF) which self- resolves in most of cases within 6 months [ 2 ]. The pathogenesis of CSC is still poorly under- stood. Recent studies suggest that choriocapil- laris (CC) endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary cause of the disease, leading to sec- ondary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dys- function [ 3 , 4 ]. While conventional imaging techniques such as fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography can only partially depict the CC, optical coherence tomography angiogra- phy (OCTA) enables the assessment and quan- tification of CC blood flow [ 5 ]. OCTA is a noninvasive technology that uses laser light reflectance of the surface of moving red blood cells to depict blood flow in the retinal and choroidal microvasculature [ 6 , 7 ]. This tech- nology has enhanced our understanding of microvascular alterations in various macular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degen- eration [ 5 ]. However, OCTA is a light source- dependent device with considerable limitations. Shadowing artifacts caused by media opacities [ 8 , 9 ] or superficial blood vessels blocking the detection of deeper vessels in the retina can compromise the analysis [ 10 ]. Similarly, pro- jection artifacts caused by traversing light reflected by deeper layers (e.g., RPE) can mimic a vascular pattern in those retinal layers and thus confound the analysis [ 11 ]. Since its introduction, several groups have used OCTA to investigate the CC in patients with CSC [ 12 – 19 ]. However, none of these studies provides follow-up data in acute CSC assessing the OCTA signal at the level of the CC when SRF is absorbed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the influence of SRF in the analysis of the flow signal from the CC via OCTA, and to describe the flow alteration after SRF absorption in acute CSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nStudy Design and Population\nThis longitudinal, cross-sectional, single-center observational case–control study was conducted in 22 consecutive patients with acute CSC (23 eyes). Only patients with classic acute CSC defined by a dome-shaped accumulation of central SRF, no pronounced RPE changes or RPE detachments, and symptoms lasting less than 4 months were included in the study [ 20 ]. Data from the baseline examinations of 17 patients were previously published by Cakir et al. [ 12 ]. Twenty age-matched and healthy participants with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 or better and no chorioretinal pathology served as controls. All patients consulted our clinic between 2016 and 2018. Follow-up examinations were performed individually according to the disease course. No study par- ticipant had any concomitant ocular disease with CSC, or prior ophthalmologic surgery or laser treatment. In particular, there was no evi- dence of acquired or hereditary macular disease. Patient characteristics including gender, date of birth, pre-existing conditions, initial diagnosis, previous treatment, and duration of symptoms were recorded. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the ethics committee of the University of Freiburg (application no. 561/16) and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls for the publication of this study and any accompanying images.\n\n\nOphthalmological Examination\nAll patients underwent a thorough ophthal- mological examination including measurement of BCVA, assessment of intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, and ophthalmoscopy after dilation with tropi- camide 1% eye drops. Additionally, all patients\nunderwent spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and fun- dus autofluorescence imaging (Spectralis HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). OCTA examinations were performed using the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . It uses full-spectrum spectral domain (SD-OCT) with a light-source wave- length of 840 nm, an A-scan rate of 68,000 A-scans per second, and an A-scan depth of 2.0 nm in tissue (1024 pixels). The built-in software was used to eliminate artifacts created from superficial vascular layers. Each patient underwent a 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan. For OCTA visualization of the CC layer, a 30 l m slab between 29 and 59 l m below the inner RPE was manually selected for each patient.\nAbnormal CC decorrelation signals were quantified using an image-processing algorithm programmed in R ( http://www.r-project.org ) as described previously [ 12 , 13 ]. Briefly, images were processed via a Gaussian blur and mor- phological hdome-operator, and the average grayscale value was determined. The threshold for the color-coding was calculated for each OCTA image using the averaged grayscale value of all pixels (brightness of pixel) plus (increased flow, red pixels) or minus (decreased flow, green pixels) a constant and predefined threshold value. Before quantifying the pixel counts, shadowing artifacts of the inner retinal vessels were manually removed from each image. The pixel counts were used for statistical analyses. The average retinal thickness of the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan was measured via the heat-map image containing macular thickness informa- tion obtained from the Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . To explore a possible longitudinal correla- tion between SRF alterations and the CC flow signal over time, the difference in average reti- nal thickness ( D RT) between baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination was correlated with the difference in increased and decreased OCTA flow signal.\nTo analyze the potential vascular change in the CC in the area previously occupied by SRF and with no SRF at the time of follow-up\nexamination, the color-coded CC images were aligned with the corresponding heat-map ima- ges. The area revealing macular thickness exceeding 450 l m was defined as the region of interest and automatically outlined by the software. Red and green pixel counts within and outside the area were recorded and used for comparison with the control group. For statis- tical analyses, the percentage of the area with decreased versus increased flow signal was used.\n\n\nStatistical Methods\nStatistical analysis was performed using Graph- Pad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare paired samples, and the Wilcoxon test was performed to compare unpaired samples. Bonferroni correction due to multiple compar- isons was included. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman’s R ) was used to deter- mine the relationship between SRF and OCTA flow signal. Data were considered significant at p \\ 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 23 eyes from 22 patients with acute CSC (male/female 19/3) and 20 eyes from 20 controls (male/female 10/10) were included in this study. The average age of the CSC popula- tion was 51.2 years (range 37–80), compared with 49.9 years (range 22–79) in the control group ( p = 0.93). The time from the first symp- tom to the first examination in our hospital ranged from 0 to 86 days (average 20.2 ± 29.6 days). After the initial diagnosis, 10 patients had been treated with eplerenone, whereas 12 patients had not been treated with any systemic or topical medication. Follow-up examination was performed 134 ± 112 days after baseline examination. In 13 eyes (12 patients), SRF was completely absorbed at the follow-up examination. Five of these patients had been treated with eplerenone, while seven remained untreated.\n\n\nLongitudinal Correlation Between\nSubretinal Fluid Alterations and the Signal of Flow of the CC Over Time\nIn the 19 eyes in which average retinal thickness was decreased at follow-up (BL: 334.5 ± 29.3 l m, FU: 298.9 ± 20.8 l m, p \\ 0.0001), we observed a significant reduction in CC alter- ations at follow-up compared with baseline examination (Fig. 1 a, b). The area of increased CC flow signal was 3.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline and 2.04% ( ± 1.1%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.002). Similarly, the area of reduced flow signal decreased from 2.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline to 1.10% ( ± 0.6%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.003). However, in the four eyes in which retinal thickness increased over time (retinal thickness at BL: 308.6 ± 11.7 l m, FU: 338.2 ± 26.8 l m, p = 0.08), we found no obvi- ous difference in the area of CC flow changes at follow-up relative to the baseline examination. The areas of both increased CC flow signal (2.5% ± 1.7%) and decreased CC flow signal (2.3% ± 2.2%) were similar between the base- line and follow-up examinations (3.8% ± 2.4% and 3.5% ± 3.3, p = 0.56 and p = 0.25). Inter- estingly, the area of diminished OCTA signal shifted below the center at follow-up examina- tion, which was associated with a downward shift of the SRF (Fig. 1 c, d). To explore the correlation between SRF and the OCTA flow signal of the CC, we correlated the difference in average retinal thickness on the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan between baseline and follow-up examination with the difference in detected OCTA flow signal from the CC. Using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test, we found that the extent of SRF correlated significantly with the CC flow alterations (de- creased flow: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001, increased flow: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005, Fig. 1 e, f).\n\n\nChange in the OCTA Signal\nfrom the Choriocapillaris After Complete Absorption of SRF\nTo analyze the OCTA signals in the CC follow- ing SRF absorption, 13 eyes presenting complete absorption of SRF at follow-up were evaluated.\nFig. 1 A decrease in subretinal ﬂuid is associated with a reduction in OCTA choriocapillaris alteration.

Decreased ﬂow\nLooking at the entire 6 9 6 mm 2 OCTA image, the OCTA signal alterations were greater at the baseline examination compared with the fol- low-up examination (increased flow: p \\ 0.028, decreased flow: p \\ 0.009) and with healthy controls (increased flow: p \\ 0.039, decreased flow: p \\ 0.039; Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). No statistically significant difference was found in the decor- relation signals between CSC patients without SRF and healthy controls when the entire image was analyzed. However, when looking at the area where the SRF was initially located, the decreased OCTA flow signal persisted and was significantly more pronounced than in healthy controls despite the absence of SRF ( p \\ 0.008; Fig. 2 e, Table 1 ). These data point toward local- ized CC changes that are spatially correlated with the area of SRF in acute CSC and persist in inactive CSC, independent of SRF. The detailed statistical results for the analysis of changes in the OCTA flow signal from the CC in patients with acute CSC after complete SRF absorption are listed in Table 2 .\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a promising noninvasive technique for imaging the microvasculature of the retina and choroid. However, artifacts occurring in OCTA, such as shadowing artifacts caused by intra- or subretinal fluid (SRF), may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [ 9 , 11 , 21 ]. In this longitudinal OCTA study, we demonstrate a strong temporospatial associa- tion between SRF and reduced OCTA signals from the choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with acute CSC, indicating that SRF might be a sig- nificant confounder for the OCTA analysis of the CC.\nSeveral studies have shown that the OCTA signal of the CC is reduced in patients with CSC, interpreted as reduced blood flow of the CC [ 14 , 16 – 18 ]. Although some authors have suspected that SRF contributes to the reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC in the sense of a shadow artifact [ 12 , 22 ], this could not be demonstrated due to lack of follow-up data. Our longitudinal study shows that CSC patients with complete absorption of SRF at follow-up demonstrate a significant reduction in OCTA flow alterations in the CC, indicating that SRF prevents the detection of OCTA signals from the CC. In line with this finding, patients with persistent and vertically displaced SRF at the follow-up examination exhibited a reduced OCTA signal from the CC in the affected area. These findings support the prevailing hypothe- sis that SRF is a disruptive factor in the analy- sisof CC via OCTA and that the quantitativeanalysis of CC flow changes in the presence of retinal fluid must be considered with caution [ 5 , 12 ]. This applies not only to CSC, but also to other retinal vascular diseases associated with subretinal or intraretinal fluid, such as neovascular age-related macular degen- eration (AMD). For example, in geographic atrophy in AMD, it has been assumed and his- tologically demonstrated that RPE atrophy is associated with CC atrophy [ 23 , 24 ]. CC OCTA studies, correspondingly, have shown decreased CC flow in areas of RPE atrophy [ 25 , 26 ]. Simi- larly, CC OCTA studies in patients with\nTable 1 Change in the OCTA ﬂow signal from the choriocapillaris in patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) after complete absorption of subretinal ﬂuid (SRF)\nCSC follow-up w/o SRF\nintermediate and subclinical exudative AMD have postulated the existence of CC signal voids [ 27 , 28 ]. Considering our results, especially in the description and quantification of CC signal voids in patients with neovascular AMD, intra- or subretinal fluid above this area must be excluded with confidence [ 29 ]. Further studies investigating this hypothesis are needed and must exclude any intraretinal or subretinal flu- ids which, as shown in this study, can signifi- cantly affect OCT CC and potentially even mimic CC signal voids.\nBy following up patients with acute CSC until the absorption of SRF, our study bypasses the above-mentioned shadowing effect of SRF on the OCTA flow signal, and a more reliable conclusion about possible vascular changes in the CC can be drawn. Interestingly, we found that the reduced OCTA signal in the CC per- sisted after SRF absorption, indicating a reduced blood flow in the CC in CSC patients that is spatially associated with the area of SRF. This hypothesis is in line with previous OCTA CC studies describing areas of low flow signal in CSC patients [ 12 , 15 – 17 ] which may indicate a thinned CC pushed upward by pachyvessels or low blood flow at the CC level [ 14 , 22 ]. Studies applying indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) support this assumption [ 4 , 30 , 31 ] and show delayed choroidal filling on ICGA at the site of the hot spot in 82% of CSC patients [ 32 ] and a 45% reduction in choroidal blood flow in CSC eyes compared with unaffected fellow eyes [ 33 ]. A comparison of OCTA and ICGA demonstrated that areas with coarse low-reflec- tive OCTA signal corresponded with the area of hypo-fluorescence on early-phase ICGA [ 22 ]. These studies support the findings of our study and indicate that CSC is associated with reduced choroidal blood blow.\nWe acknowledge that this study has some limitations, including its retrospective design and small number of patients. Although age- matched controls were used, we did not match patients regarding refraction or length of bul- bus, nor did we collect blood pressure or anti- hypertensive medication data, both of which might be confounders in our study. Although shadowing artifacts by SRF were excluded, arti- facts are potentially caused by RPE and\nphotoreceptor outer segment irregularities as well as RPE detachment [ 34 , 35 ]. Since pro- nounced RPE changes after one episode of acute CSC are mild and are not located exclusively in the area previously occupied by SRF, a shad- owing artifact on the OCTA flow signal from the CC of these RPE changes seems unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded. Another limitation of our study is the use of the averaged pixel intensity of each image to determine increased and decreased flow changes within the same image. Therefore, local, large deviations in the flow signal influence the average signal, which may have caused some over- and underestima- tion of flow changes. Prospective longitudinal studies with optimized image acquisition tech- niques less prone to artifacts are therefore nec- essary to further validate our findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, this longitudinal OCTA study reports follow-up data from patients with acute CSC during their initial episode of CSC until SRF was completely removed. Although we demonstrate that SRF is a distinct confounder when analyzing the CC via OCTA, we also reveal that the OCTA flow signal from the CC within the area previously occupied by SRF continues to be reduced after SRF has com- pletely resolved compared with that in healthy controls, indicating reduced blood flow in patients with acute CSC.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the participants of the study.\nFunding.

Twenty-three eyes of 22 patients with acute CSC were compared with 20 eyes of 20 healthy controls. OCTA images (AngioPlex Ò , Zeiss) were recorded at baseline and follow-up examination and auto- matically quantified using an image-processing algorithm. Abnormal CC decorrelation signals (increased and decreased flow, IF and DF) were quantified using a custom image-processing algorithm. To analyze the spatial correlation between SRF and OCTA, CC signal heat-map images containing macular thickness informa- tion were used.\nResults : Choriocapillaris flow alterations were significantly more pronounced at baseline than at follow-up examination in patients with acute CSC and resolving SRF (IF: p \\ 0.002; DF: p \\ 0.003).

In particular, the reduced OCTA flow signal in the area occupied by SRF at baseline disappeared at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.02). In comparison with controls, CSC patients with complete resorption of SRF continued to show a reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC ( p \\ 0.008). Conclusions : The temporospatial association between SRF and reduced OCTA signal from the CC demonstrates that fluid might be a signifi- cant confounder for OCTA analysis in patients with CSC.

It is characterized by localized subretinal fluid (SRF) which self- resolves in most of cases within 6 months [ 2 ]. The pathogenesis of CSC is still poorly under- stood. Recent studies suggest that choriocapil- laris (CC) endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary cause of the disease, leading to sec- ondary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dys- function [ 3 , 4 ]. While conventional imaging techniques such as fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography can only partially depict the CC, optical coherence tomography angiogra- phy (OCTA) enables the assessment and quan- tification of CC blood flow [ 5 ]. OCTA is a noninvasive technology that uses laser light reflectance of the surface of moving red blood cells to depict blood flow in the retinal and choroidal microvasculature [ 6 , 7 ]. This tech- nology has enhanced our understanding of microvascular alterations in various macular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degen- eration [ 5 ]. However, OCTA is a light source- dependent device with considerable limitations. Shadowing artifacts caused by media opacities [ 8 , 9 ] or superficial blood vessels blocking the detection of deeper vessels in the retina can compromise the analysis [ 10 ]. Similarly, pro- jection artifacts caused by traversing light reflected by deeper layers (e.g., RPE) can mimic a vascular pattern in those retinal layers and thus confound the analysis [ 11 ]. Since its introduction, several groups have used OCTA to investigate the CC in patients with CSC [ 12 – 19 ]. However, none of these studies provides follow-up data in acute CSC assessing the OCTA signal at the level of the CC when SRF is absorbed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the influence of SRF in the analysis of the flow signal from the CC via OCTA, and to describe the flow alteration after SRF absorption in acute CSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nStudy Design and Population\nThis longitudinal, cross-sectional, single-center observational case–control study was conducted in 22 consecutive patients with acute CSC (23 eyes). Only patients with classic acute CSC defined by a dome-shaped accumulation of central SRF, no pronounced RPE changes or RPE detachments, and symptoms lasting less than 4 months were included in the study [ 20 ]. Data from the baseline examinations of 17 patients were previously published by Cakir et al. [ 12 ]. Twenty age-matched and healthy participants with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 or better and no chorioretinal pathology served as controls. All patients consulted our clinic between 2016 and 2018. Follow-up examinations were performed individually according to the disease course. No study par- ticipant had any concomitant ocular disease with CSC, or prior ophthalmologic surgery or laser treatment. In particular, there was no evi- dence of acquired or hereditary macular disease. Patient characteristics including gender, date of birth, pre-existing conditions, initial diagnosis, previous treatment, and duration of symptoms were recorded. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the ethics committee of the University of Freiburg (application no. 561/16) and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls for the publication of this study and any accompanying images.\n\n\nOphthalmological Examination\nAll patients underwent a thorough ophthal- mological examination including measurement of BCVA, assessment of intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, and ophthalmoscopy after dilation with tropi- camide 1% eye drops. Additionally, all patients\nunderwent spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and fun- dus autofluorescence imaging (Spectralis HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). OCTA examinations were performed using the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . It uses full-spectrum spectral domain (SD-OCT) with a light-source wave- length of 840 nm, an A-scan rate of 68,000 A-scans per second, and an A-scan depth of 2.0 nm in tissue (1024 pixels). The built-in software was used to eliminate artifacts created from superficial vascular layers. Each patient underwent a 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan. For OCTA visualization of the CC layer, a 30 l m slab between 29 and 59 l m below the inner RPE was manually selected for each patient.\nAbnormal CC decorrelation signals were quantified using an image-processing algorithm programmed in R ( http://www.r-project.org ) as described previously [ 12 , 13 ]. Briefly, images were processed via a Gaussian blur and mor- phological hdome-operator, and the average grayscale value was determined. The threshold for the color-coding was calculated for each OCTA image using the averaged grayscale value of all pixels (brightness of pixel) plus (increased flow, red pixels) or minus (decreased flow, green pixels) a constant and predefined threshold value. Before quantifying the pixel counts, shadowing artifacts of the inner retinal vessels were manually removed from each image. The pixel counts were used for statistical analyses. The average retinal thickness of the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan was measured via the heat-map image containing macular thickness informa- tion obtained from the Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . To explore a possible longitudinal correla- tion between SRF alterations and the CC flow signal over time, the difference in average reti- nal thickness ( D RT) between baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination was correlated with the difference in increased and decreased OCTA flow signal.\nTo analyze the potential vascular change in the CC in the area previously occupied by SRF and with no SRF at the time of follow-up\nexamination, the color-coded CC images were aligned with the corresponding heat-map ima- ges. The area revealing macular thickness exceeding 450 l m was defined as the region of interest and automatically outlined by the software. Red and green pixel counts within and outside the area were recorded and used for comparison with the control group. For statis- tical analyses, the percentage of the area with decreased versus increased flow signal was used.\n\n\nStatistical Methods\nStatistical analysis was performed using Graph- Pad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare paired samples, and the Wilcoxon test was performed to compare unpaired samples. Bonferroni correction due to multiple compar- isons was included. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman’s R ) was used to deter- mine the relationship between SRF and OCTA flow signal. Data were considered significant at p \\ 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 23 eyes from 22 patients with acute CSC (male/female 19/3) and 20 eyes from 20 controls (male/female 10/10) were included in this study. The average age of the CSC popula- tion was 51.2 years (range 37–80), compared with 49.9 years (range 22–79) in the control group ( p = 0.93). The time from the first symp- tom to the first examination in our hospital ranged from 0 to 86 days (average 20.2 ± 29.6 days). After the initial diagnosis, 10 patients had been treated with eplerenone, whereas 12 patients had not been treated with any systemic or topical medication. Follow-up examination was performed 134 ± 112 days after baseline examination. In 13 eyes (12 patients), SRF was completely absorbed at the follow-up examination. Five of these patients had been treated with eplerenone, while seven remained untreated.\n\n\nLongitudinal Correlation Between\nSubretinal Fluid Alterations and the Signal of Flow of the CC Over Time\nIn the 19 eyes in which average retinal thickness was decreased at follow-up (BL: 334.5 ± 29.3 l m, FU: 298.9 ± 20.8 l m, p \\ 0.0001), we observed a significant reduction in CC alter- ations at follow-up compared with baseline examination (Fig. 1 a, b). The area of increased CC flow signal was 3.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline and 2.04% ( ± 1.1%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.002). Similarly, the area of reduced flow signal decreased from 2.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline to 1.10% ( ± 0.6%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.003). However, in the four eyes in which retinal thickness increased over time (retinal thickness at BL: 308.6 ± 11.7 l m, FU: 338.2 ± 26.8 l m, p = 0.08), we found no obvi- ous difference in the area of CC flow changes at follow-up relative to the baseline examination. The areas of both increased CC flow signal (2.5% ± 1.7%) and decreased CC flow signal (2.3% ± 2.2%) were similar between the base- line and follow-up examinations (3.8% ± 2.4% and 3.5% ± 3.3, p = 0.56 and p = 0.25). Inter- estingly, the area of diminished OCTA signal shifted below the center at follow-up examina- tion, which was associated with a downward shift of the SRF (Fig. 1 c, d). To explore the correlation between SRF and the OCTA flow signal of the CC, we correlated the difference in average retinal thickness on the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan between baseline and follow-up examination with the difference in detected OCTA flow signal from the CC. Using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test, we found that the extent of SRF correlated significantly with the CC flow alterations (de- creased flow: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001, increased flow: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005, Fig. 1 e, f).\n\n\nChange in the OCTA Signal\nfrom the Choriocapillaris After Complete Absorption of SRF\nTo analyze the OCTA signals in the CC follow- ing SRF absorption, 13 eyes presenting complete absorption of SRF at follow-up were evaluated.\nFig. 1 A decrease in subretinal ﬂuid is associated with a reduction in OCTA choriocapillaris alteration.

Representative fundus autoﬂuorescence (FAF, ﬁrst column), retinal thickness heat maps (second column), OCTA images of the choriocapillaris (CC) without and with ﬂow pseudo-coloration (middle columns), and a merged image (last column) are shown. Decreased ﬂow\nLooking at the entire 6 9 6 mm 2 OCTA image, the OCTA signal alterations were greater at the baseline examination compared with the fol- low-up examination (increased flow: p \\ 0.028, decreased flow: p \\ 0.009) and with healthy controls (increased flow: p \\ 0.039, decreased flow: p \\ 0.039; Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). No statistically significant difference was found in the decor- relation signals between CSC patients without SRF and healthy controls when the entire image was analyzed. However, when looking at the area where the SRF was initially located, the decreased OCTA flow signal persisted and was significantly more pronounced than in healthy controls despite the absence of SRF ( p \\ 0.008; Fig. 2 e, Table 1 ). These data point toward local- ized CC changes that are spatially correlated with the area of SRF in acute CSC and persist in inactive CSC, independent of SRF. The detailed statistical results for the analysis of changes in the OCTA flow signal from the CC in patients with acute CSC after complete SRF absorption are listed in Table 2 .\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a promising noninvasive technique for imaging the microvasculature of the retina and choroid. However, artifacts occurring in OCTA, such as shadowing artifacts caused by intra- or subretinal fluid (SRF), may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [ 9 , 11 , 21 ]. In this longitudinal OCTA study, we demonstrate a strong temporospatial associa- tion between SRF and reduced OCTA signals from the choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with acute CSC, indicating that SRF might be a sig- nificant confounder for the OCTA analysis of the CC.\nSeveral studies have shown that the OCTA signal of the CC is reduced in patients with CSC, interpreted as reduced blood flow of the CC [ 14 , 16 – 18 ]. Although some authors have suspected that SRF contributes to the reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC in the sense of a shadow artifact [ 12 , 22 ], this could not be demonstrated due to lack of follow-up data. Our longitudinal study shows that CSC patients with complete absorption of SRF at follow-up demonstrate a significant reduction in OCTA flow alterations in the CC, indicating that SRF prevents the detection of OCTA signals from the CC. In line with this finding, patients with persistent and vertically displaced SRF at the follow-up examination exhibited a reduced OCTA signal from the CC in the affected area. These findings support the prevailing hypothe- sis that SRF is a disruptive factor in the analy- sisof CC via OCTA and that the quantitativeanalysis of CC flow changes in the presence of retinal fluid must be considered with caution [ 5 , 12 ]. This applies not only to CSC, but also to other retinal vascular diseases associated with subretinal or intraretinal fluid, such as neovascular age-related macular degen- eration (AMD). For example, in geographic atrophy in AMD, it has been assumed and his- tologically demonstrated that RPE atrophy is associated with CC atrophy [ 23 , 24 ]. CC OCTA studies, correspondingly, have shown decreased CC flow in areas of RPE atrophy [ 25 , 26 ]. Simi- larly, CC OCTA studies in patients with\nTable 1 Change in the OCTA ﬂow signal from the choriocapillaris in patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) after complete absorption of subretinal ﬂuid (SRF)\nCSC follow-up w/o SRF\nintermediate and subclinical exudative AMD have postulated the existence of CC signal voids [ 27 , 28 ]. Considering our results, especially in the description and quantification of CC signal voids in patients with neovascular AMD, intra- or subretinal fluid above this area must be excluded with confidence [ 29 ]. Further studies investigating this hypothesis are needed and must exclude any intraretinal or subretinal flu- ids which, as shown in this study, can signifi- cantly affect OCT CC and potentially even mimic CC signal voids.\nBy following up patients with acute CSC until the absorption of SRF, our study bypasses the above-mentioned shadowing effect of SRF on the OCTA flow signal, and a more reliable conclusion about possible vascular changes in the CC can be drawn. Interestingly, we found that the reduced OCTA signal in the CC per- sisted after SRF absorption, indicating a reduced blood flow in the CC in CSC patients that is spatially associated with the area of SRF. This hypothesis is in line with previous OCTA CC studies describing areas of low flow signal in CSC patients [ 12 , 15 – 17 ] which may indicate a thinned CC pushed upward by pachyvessels or low blood flow at the CC level [ 14 , 22 ]. Studies applying indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) support this assumption [ 4 , 30 , 31 ] and show delayed choroidal filling on ICGA at the site of the hot spot in 82% of CSC patients [ 32 ] and a 45% reduction in choroidal blood flow in CSC eyes compared with unaffected fellow eyes [ 33 ]. A comparison of OCTA and ICGA demonstrated that areas with coarse low-reflec- tive OCTA signal corresponded with the area of hypo-fluorescence on early-phase ICGA [ 22 ]. These studies support the findings of our study and indicate that CSC is associated with reduced choroidal blood blow.\nWe acknowledge that this study has some limitations, including its retrospective design and small number of patients. Although age- matched controls were used, we did not match patients regarding refraction or length of bul- bus, nor did we collect blood pressure or anti- hypertensive medication data, both of which might be confounders in our study. Although shadowing artifacts by SRF were excluded, arti- facts are potentially caused by RPE and\nphotoreceptor outer segment irregularities as well as RPE detachment [ 34 , 35 ]. Since pro- nounced RPE changes after one episode of acute CSC are mild and are not located exclusively in the area previously occupied by SRF, a shad- owing artifact on the OCTA flow signal from the CC of these RPE changes seems unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded. Another limitation of our study is the use of the averaged pixel intensity of each image to determine increased and decreased flow changes within the same image. Therefore, local, large deviations in the flow signal influence the average signal, which may have caused some over- and underestima- tion of flow changes. Prospective longitudinal studies with optimized image acquisition tech- niques less prone to artifacts are therefore nec- essary to further validate our findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, this longitudinal OCTA study reports follow-up data from patients with acute CSC during their initial episode of CSC until SRF was completely removed. Although we demonstrate that SRF is a distinct confounder when analyzing the CC via OCTA, we also reveal that the OCTA flow signal from the CC within the area previously occupied by SRF continues to be reduced after SRF has com- pletely resolved compared with that in healthy controls, indicating reduced blood flow in patients with acute CSC.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the participants of the study.\nFunding.

Twenty-three eyes of 22 patients with acute CSC were compared with 20 eyes of 20 healthy controls. OCTA images (AngioPlex Ò , Zeiss) were recorded at baseline and follow-up examination and auto- matically quantified using an image-processing algorithm. Abnormal CC decorrelation signals (increased and decreased flow, IF and DF) were quantified using a custom image-processing algorithm. To analyze the spatial correlation between SRF and OCTA, CC signal heat-map images containing macular thickness informa- tion were used.\nResults : Choriocapillaris flow alterations were significantly more pronounced at baseline than at follow-up examination in patients with acute CSC and resolving SRF (IF: p \\ 0.002; DF: p \\ 0.003). The extent of SRF correlated signifi- cantly with the abnormal CC decorrelation signals when comparing baseline with follow- up examinations (IF: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005; DF: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001). In particular, the reduced OCTA flow signal in the area occupied by SRF at baseline disappeared at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.02). In comparison with controls, CSC patients with complete resorption of SRF continued to show a reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC ( p \\ 0.008). Conclusions : The temporospatial association between SRF and reduced OCTA signal from the CC demonstrates that fluid might be a signifi- cant confounder for OCTA analysis in patients with CSC. CSC patients with complete absorp- tion of the SRF at follow-up, however, show persistently reduced CC flow signals.\nKeywords: Artifacts; Central serous chorioretinopathy; Choriocapillaris; OCT angiography; Subretinal fluid\n\n\nAbbreviations\nD RT Difference in average retinal thickness between baseline and follow-up examination\nAMD Age-related macular degener- ation\nEnhanced Digital Features To view enhanced digital features for this article go to https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.9948569 .\nM.

It is characterized by localized subretinal fluid (SRF) which self- resolves in most of cases within 6 months [ 2 ]. The pathogenesis of CSC is still poorly under- stood. Recent studies suggest that choriocapil- laris (CC) endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary cause of the disease, leading to sec- ondary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dys- function [ 3 , 4 ]. While conventional imaging techniques such as fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography can only partially depict the CC, optical coherence tomography angiogra- phy (OCTA) enables the assessment and quan- tification of CC blood flow [ 5 ]. OCTA is a noninvasive technology that uses laser light reflectance of the surface of moving red blood cells to depict blood flow in the retinal and choroidal microvasculature [ 6 , 7 ]. This tech- nology has enhanced our understanding of microvascular alterations in various macular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degen- eration [ 5 ]. However, OCTA is a light source- dependent device with considerable limitations. Shadowing artifacts caused by media opacities [ 8 , 9 ] or superficial blood vessels blocking the detection of deeper vessels in the retina can compromise the analysis [ 10 ]. Similarly, pro- jection artifacts caused by traversing light reflected by deeper layers (e.g., RPE) can mimic a vascular pattern in those retinal layers and thus confound the analysis [ 11 ]. Since its introduction, several groups have used OCTA to investigate the CC in patients with CSC [ 12 – 19 ]. However, none of these studies provides follow-up data in acute CSC assessing the OCTA signal at the level of the CC when SRF is absorbed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the influence of SRF in the analysis of the flow signal from the CC via OCTA, and to describe the flow alteration after SRF absorption in acute CSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nStudy Design and Population\nThis longitudinal, cross-sectional, single-center observational case–control study was conducted in 22 consecutive patients with acute CSC (23 eyes). Only patients with classic acute CSC defined by a dome-shaped accumulation of central SRF, no pronounced RPE changes or RPE detachments, and symptoms lasting less than 4 months were included in the study [ 20 ]. Data from the baseline examinations of 17 patients were previously published by Cakir et al. [ 12 ]. Twenty age-matched and healthy participants with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 or better and no chorioretinal pathology served as controls. All patients consulted our clinic between 2016 and 2018. Follow-up examinations were performed individually according to the disease course. No study par- ticipant had any concomitant ocular disease with CSC, or prior ophthalmologic surgery or laser treatment. In particular, there was no evi- dence of acquired or hereditary macular disease. Patient characteristics including gender, date of birth, pre-existing conditions, initial diagnosis, previous treatment, and duration of symptoms were recorded. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the ethics committee of the University of Freiburg (application no. 561/16) and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls for the publication of this study and any accompanying images.\n\n\nOphthalmological Examination\nAll patients underwent a thorough ophthal- mological examination including measurement of BCVA, assessment of intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, and ophthalmoscopy after dilation with tropi- camide 1% eye drops. Additionally, all patients\nunderwent spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and fun- dus autofluorescence imaging (Spectralis HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). OCTA examinations were performed using the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . It uses full-spectrum spectral domain (SD-OCT) with a light-source wave- length of 840 nm, an A-scan rate of 68,000 A-scans per second, and an A-scan depth of 2.0 nm in tissue (1024 pixels). The built-in software was used to eliminate artifacts created from superficial vascular layers. Each patient underwent a 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan. For OCTA visualization of the CC layer, a 30 l m slab between 29 and 59 l m below the inner RPE was manually selected for each patient.\nAbnormal CC decorrelation signals were quantified using an image-processing algorithm programmed in R ( http://www.r-project.org ) as described previously [ 12 , 13 ]. Briefly, images were processed via a Gaussian blur and mor- phological hdome-operator, and the average grayscale value was determined. The threshold for the color-coding was calculated for each OCTA image using the averaged grayscale value of all pixels (brightness of pixel) plus (increased flow, red pixels) or minus (decreased flow, green pixels) a constant and predefined threshold value. Before quantifying the pixel counts, shadowing artifacts of the inner retinal vessels were manually removed from each image. The pixel counts were used for statistical analyses. The average retinal thickness of the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan was measured via the heat-map image containing macular thickness informa- tion obtained from the Zeiss Cirrus 5000 AngioPlex Ò . To explore a possible longitudinal correla- tion between SRF alterations and the CC flow signal over time, the difference in average reti- nal thickness ( D RT) between baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination was correlated with the difference in increased and decreased OCTA flow signal.\nTo analyze the potential vascular change in the CC in the area previously occupied by SRF and with no SRF at the time of follow-up\nexamination, the color-coded CC images were aligned with the corresponding heat-map ima- ges. The area revealing macular thickness exceeding 450 l m was defined as the region of interest and automatically outlined by the software. Red and green pixel counts within and outside the area were recorded and used for comparison with the control group. For statis- tical analyses, the percentage of the area with decreased versus increased flow signal was used.\n\n\nStatistical Methods\nStatistical analysis was performed using Graph- Pad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare paired samples, and the Wilcoxon test was performed to compare unpaired samples. Bonferroni correction due to multiple compar- isons was included. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman’s R ) was used to deter- mine the relationship between SRF and OCTA flow signal. Data were considered significant at p \\ 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nPatient Characteristics\nA total of 23 eyes from 22 patients with acute CSC (male/female 19/3) and 20 eyes from 20 controls (male/female 10/10) were included in this study. The average age of the CSC popula- tion was 51.2 years (range 37–80), compared with 49.9 years (range 22–79) in the control group ( p = 0.93). The time from the first symp- tom to the first examination in our hospital ranged from 0 to 86 days (average 20.2 ± 29.6 days). After the initial diagnosis, 10 patients had been treated with eplerenone, whereas 12 patients had not been treated with any systemic or topical medication. Follow-up examination was performed 134 ± 112 days after baseline examination. In 13 eyes (12 patients), SRF was completely absorbed at the follow-up examination. Five of these patients had been treated with eplerenone, while seven remained untreated.\n\n\nLongitudinal Correlation Between\nSubretinal Fluid Alterations and the Signal of Flow of the CC Over Time\nIn the 19 eyes in which average retinal thickness was decreased at follow-up (BL: 334.5 ± 29.3 l m, FU: 298.9 ± 20.8 l m, p \\ 0.0001), we observed a significant reduction in CC alter- ations at follow-up compared with baseline examination (Fig. 1 a, b). The area of increased CC flow signal was 3.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline and 2.04% ( ± 1.1%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.002). Similarly, the area of reduced flow signal decreased from 2.5% ( ± 1.4%) at baseline to 1.10% ( ± 0.6%) at follow-up examination ( p \\ 0.003). However, in the four eyes in which retinal thickness increased over time (retinal thickness at BL: 308.6 ± 11.7 l m, FU: 338.2 ± 26.8 l m, p = 0.08), we found no obvi- ous difference in the area of CC flow changes at follow-up relative to the baseline examination. The areas of both increased CC flow signal (2.5% ± 1.7%) and decreased CC flow signal (2.3% ± 2.2%) were similar between the base- line and follow-up examinations (3.8% ± 2.4% and 3.5% ± 3.3, p = 0.56 and p = 0.25). Inter- estingly, the area of diminished OCTA signal shifted below the center at follow-up examina- tion, which was associated with a downward shift of the SRF (Fig. 1 c, d). To explore the correlation between SRF and the OCTA flow signal of the CC, we correlated the difference in average retinal thickness on the 6 9 6 mm 2 volume scan between baseline and follow-up examination with the difference in detected OCTA flow signal from the CC. Using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test, we found that the extent of SRF correlated significantly with the CC flow alterations (de- creased flow: rho = 0.64, p \\ 0.001, increased flow: rho = 0.56, p \\ 0.005, Fig. 1 e, f).\n\n\nChange in the OCTA Signal\nfrom the Choriocapillaris After Complete Absorption of SRF\nTo analyze the OCTA signals in the CC follow- ing SRF absorption, 13 eyes presenting complete absorption of SRF at follow-up were evaluated.\nFig. 1 A decrease in subretinal ﬂuid is associated with a reduction in OCTA choriocapillaris alteration.

Representative fundus autoﬂuorescence (FAF, ﬁrst column), retinal thickness heat maps (second column), OCTA images of the choriocapillaris (CC) without and with ﬂow pseudo-coloration (middle columns), and a merged image (last column) are shown. Decreased ﬂow\nLooking at the entire 6 9 6 mm 2 OCTA image, the OCTA signal alterations were greater at the baseline examination compared with the fol- low-up examination (increased flow: p \\ 0.028, decreased flow: p \\ 0.009) and with healthy controls (increased flow: p \\ 0.039, decreased flow: p \\ 0.039; Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). No statistically significant difference was found in the decor- relation signals between CSC patients without SRF and healthy controls when the entire image was analyzed. However, when looking at the area where the SRF was initially located, the decreased OCTA flow signal persisted and was significantly more pronounced than in healthy controls despite the absence of SRF ( p \\ 0.008; Fig. 2 e, Table 1 ). These data point toward local- ized CC changes that are spatially correlated with the area of SRF in acute CSC and persist in inactive CSC, independent of SRF. The detailed statistical results for the analysis of changes in the OCTA flow signal from the CC in patients with acute CSC after complete SRF absorption are listed in Table 2 .\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a promising noninvasive technique for imaging the microvasculature of the retina and choroid. However, artifacts occurring in OCTA, such as shadowing artifacts caused by intra- or subretinal fluid (SRF), may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [ 9 , 11 , 21 ]. In this longitudinal OCTA study, we demonstrate a strong temporospatial associa- tion between SRF and reduced OCTA signals from the choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with acute CSC, indicating that SRF might be a sig- nificant confounder for the OCTA analysis of the CC.\nSeveral studies have shown that the OCTA signal of the CC is reduced in patients with CSC, interpreted as reduced blood flow of the CC [ 14 , 16 – 18 ]. Although some authors have suspected that SRF contributes to the reduced OCTA flow signal in the CC in the sense of a shadow artifact [ 12 , 22 ], this could not be demonstrated due to lack of follow-up data. Our longitudinal study shows that CSC patients with complete absorption of SRF at follow-up demonstrate a significant reduction in OCTA flow alterations in the CC, indicating that SRF prevents the detection of OCTA signals from the CC. In line with this finding, patients with persistent and vertically displaced SRF at the follow-up examination exhibited a reduced OCTA signal from the CC in the affected area. These findings support the prevailing hypothe- sis that SRF is a disruptive factor in the analy- sisof CC via OCTA and that the quantitativeanalysis of CC flow changes in the presence of retinal fluid must be considered with caution [ 5 , 12 ]. This applies not only to CSC, but also to other retinal vascular diseases associated with subretinal or intraretinal fluid, such as neovascular age-related macular degen- eration (AMD). For example, in geographic atrophy in AMD, it has been assumed and his- tologically demonstrated that RPE atrophy is associated with CC atrophy [ 23 , 24 ]. CC OCTA studies, correspondingly, have shown decreased CC flow in areas of RPE atrophy [ 25 , 26 ]. Simi- larly, CC OCTA studies in patients with\nTable 1 Change in the OCTA ﬂow signal from the choriocapillaris in patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) after complete absorption of subretinal ﬂuid (SRF)\nCSC follow-up w/o SRF\nintermediate and subclinical exudative AMD have postulated the existence of CC signal voids [ 27 , 28 ]. Considering our results, especially in the description and quantification of CC signal voids in patients with neovascular AMD, intra- or subretinal fluid above this area must be excluded with confidence [ 29 ]. Further studies investigating this hypothesis are needed and must exclude any intraretinal or subretinal flu- ids which, as shown in this study, can signifi- cantly affect OCT CC and potentially even mimic CC signal voids.\nBy following up patients with acute CSC until the absorption of SRF, our study bypasses the above-mentioned shadowing effect of SRF on the OCTA flow signal, and a more reliable conclusion about possible vascular changes in the CC can be drawn. Interestingly, we found that the reduced OCTA signal in the CC per- sisted after SRF absorption, indicating a reduced blood flow in the CC in CSC patients that is spatially associated with the area of SRF. This hypothesis is in line with previous OCTA CC studies describing areas of low flow signal in CSC patients [ 12 , 15 – 17 ] which may indicate a thinned CC pushed upward by pachyvessels or low blood flow at the CC level [ 14 , 22 ]. Studies applying indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) support this assumption [ 4 , 30 , 31 ] and show delayed choroidal filling on ICGA at the site of the hot spot in 82% of CSC patients [ 32 ] and a 45% reduction in choroidal blood flow in CSC eyes compared with unaffected fellow eyes [ 33 ]. A comparison of OCTA and ICGA demonstrated that areas with coarse low-reflec- tive OCTA signal corresponded with the area of hypo-fluorescence on early-phase ICGA [ 22 ]. These studies support the findings of our study and indicate that CSC is associated with reduced choroidal blood blow.\nWe acknowledge that this study has some limitations, including its retrospective design and small number of patients. Although age- matched controls were used, we did not match patients regarding refraction or length of bul- bus, nor did we collect blood pressure or anti- hypertensive medication data, both of which might be confounders in our study. Although shadowing artifacts by SRF were excluded, arti- facts are potentially caused by RPE and\nphotoreceptor outer segment irregularities as well as RPE detachment [ 34 , 35 ]. Since pro- nounced RPE changes after one episode of acute CSC are mild and are not located exclusively in the area previously occupied by SRF, a shad- owing artifact on the OCTA flow signal from the CC of these RPE changes seems unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded. Another limitation of our study is the use of the averaged pixel intensity of each image to determine increased and decreased flow changes within the same image. Therefore, local, large deviations in the flow signal influence the average signal, which may have caused some over- and underestima- tion of flow changes. Prospective longitudinal studies with optimized image acquisition tech- niques less prone to artifacts are therefore nec- essary to further validate our findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, this longitudinal OCTA study reports follow-up data from patients with acute CSC during their initial episode of CSC until SRF was completely removed. Although we demonstrate that SRF is a distinct confounder when analyzing the CC via OCTA, we also reveal that the OCTA flow signal from the CC within the area previously occupied by SRF continues to be reduced after SRF has com- pletely resolved compared with that in healthy controls, indicating reduced blood flow in patients with acute CSC.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the participants of the study.\nFunding.

We sought to de ﬁ ne ascending aorta dilatation patterns/ progression rates in BAV versus other aortopathies (Marfan syndrome (MFS), degenerative aortopathy (DA)). Design and setting Retrospective, observational study. Aortic dilatation progression was evaluated in two tertiary care centres (US and European) by repeated echocardiography ≥ 2 years apart in adults with BAV (n=353), matched to MFS (n=50) and DA (n=51) for gender, blood pressure, and minimum follow-up time. Results At baseline, ascending aortic dilatation was present in 87% of BAV cases: tubular ascending aorta in 60% (irrespective of BAV morphology), and Valsalva sinuses dilatation in 27% (independently linked to typical BAV morphology and male gender ( p=0.0001)). After 3.6±1.2 years, the aortic dilatation rate in BAV was higher than expected for the population for all aortic levels ( p=0.005) and was maximal at the tubular ascending aorta for BAV (0.42±0.6 mm/year) and DA (0.20±0.3 mm/year), and was maximal at the Valsalva sinuses for MFS (0.49±0.5 mm/year). Maximal aortic dilatation rate was similar between BAV and MFS ( p&gt;0.40) and lower in DA ( p=0.02) but was heterogeneous in BAV, with 43% of BAV not progressing (vs 20% of MFS, p=0.01). Aortic dilatation rate was not proportionally related to baseline aortic size or BAV type (all models p&gt;0.40).\nConclusions In patients with BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses is less common and associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV (tubular segment) and MFS (Valsalva sinuses), but a signi ﬁ cantly higher proportion of BAV patients does not progress at all, irrespective of BAV type. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict progression rate; systematic follow-up is therefore warranted in patients with BAV.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital abnormality with a prevalence of 1.3%. 1 BAV is associated with endocarditis 2 and premature aortic valve dysfunction. 3 4 However, BAV is not just a valvular disorder but also an aortopathy, with aortic dilatation and risk of aortic dissection and\nrupture. 5 Valvular dysfunction may play a role in the development of aortic abnormalities, but aortic dilatation is often out of proportion to the degree of valvular dysfunction, 6 7 suggesting an intrinsic aortic tissue abnormality. Indeed, BAV studies have reported structural abnormalities of thoracic aortic tissue, including decreased ﬁ brillin, elastin fragmen- tation, matrix disruption, and apoptosis. 8 9 These similarities to Marfan syndrome (MFS) led the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association to recommend aggressive elective aortic surgery for BAV patients with aortic dilatation or sooner as possible for ‘ rapid progressors ’ . 10\nHowever, there are considerable uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that in BAV patients the risk of aortic catastrophes, although higher than in the general population, remains low. 4 5 Additionally, reports of aortic dilatation progression involved limited sample sizes and paediatric populations, 11 12 and resulted in discordant progression rates 13 – 15 with variable association with BAV function and morphology. Additionally, patterns of aortic dilata- tion with BAV were variably reported as predomin- antly involving the tubular ascending aorta (AA), 16 the Valsalva sinuses and proximal AA, 6 or as balanced, 7 and were not compared to those of MFS. The controversies regarding aortic imaging similarities and differences between various types of aortopathies (BAV, MFS, and degenerative aorto- pathy (DA)) in regard to progression rates and pat- terns of aortic dilatation are unresolved. 17 To address these controversies, we studied a large population of patients with BAV who were fol- lowed for at least 2 years at two large European and US centres, analysed aortic dilatation patterns, rates and their determinants, and as a secondary aim, compared BAV to other aortopathies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards for each institution. We identi ﬁ ed patients in two tertiary referral centres (Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and Bichat Hospital, Paris, France) with the conditions listed below, who had echocardiograms between 2003 and 2008 and the latest follow-up echocardiogram performed at least 2 years later. Three different patients groups were assembled:\nBAV patients : Adults (age ≥ 18 years) with BAV identi ﬁ ed by echocardiography were included. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery\n(except for aortic coarctation repair) or aortic dissection or the diagnoses of MFS or other severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction.\nDA patients : Adults were included if they had a tricuspid aortic valve with dilatation of the sinuses or AA (diameter &gt;40 mm) determined by echocardiogram. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, MFS, or severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 51 patients were matched to BAV patients for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\nMFS patients : Adults were included from the French Marfan and Associated Disease Centre, provided they ful ﬁ lled inter- national criteria 18 including a mutation in the FBN1 gene and had a tricuspid aortic valve at echocardiography. Exclusion cri- teria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, and severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 50 patients were matched to patients with BAV for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\n\n\nEchocardiography\nAll patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardi- ography evaluation at baseline and at follow-up. All echocardio- grams were prospectively reviewed blindly of diagnosis by an experienced observer (DD) to ensure homogeneity in the aorta measurements in both centres. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by 2D echocardiography 19 including visual estima- tion. 20 Diagnosis of BAV was based on parasternal short axis imaging of the aortic valve using either transthoracic echocardi- ography or transoesophageal echocardiography at 45°, requiring the presence of only two commissures delimiting only two aortic cusps. Bicuspid valves were classi ﬁ ed as typical (anterior and posterior cusps) when the commissures were at 4 – 10, 5 – 11 or 3 – 9 o ’ clock, and atypical (right and left cusps) when the commissures were at 1 – 7 or 12 – 6 o ’ clock ( ﬁ gure 1A). The pres- ence of a raphe was recorded. Hence, four main types were identi ﬁ ed; typical with and without raphe and atypical with and without raphe. 3 16\nAortic valve function was evaluated using Doppler methods: aortic stenosis severity was assessed by the transaortic mean gradi- ent and the aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation. Aortic stenosis was de ﬁ ned as severe when the aortic valve area (AVA) was ≤ 1 cm² or mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, and as moderate when the AVA was 1 – 1.5 cm² and mean gradient 25 – 40 mm Hg. 10\nMeasurements of the aortic annulus were performed in early systole, parasternal long axis view zoomed on the left ventricular out ﬂ ow tract, inner edge to inner edge, at insertion points of the aortic cusps. Aortic regurgitation (AR) evaluation 21 was based on American Society of Echocardiography criteria, with classi ﬁ cation as ≤ mild, moderate, and &gt;moderate using colour Doppler jet width and extension, vena contracta width measurement and, when possible, quantitative measurements using the proximal iso- velocity surface area method. The aetiology of AR was classi ﬁ ed as: cusp prolapse, cusp degeneration (cusp thickening and restric- tion), predominant annular enlargement, or indeterminate.\nAll measurements of the aorta were performed by the same investigator (DD) according to recommendations and on the QRS complex of the ECG. 22 23 The dimensions of the Valsalva sinuses were measured perpendicular to the right and left (or non-) aortic sinuses. The sinotubular junction (STJ) was mea- sured where the aortic sinuses met the tubular aorta. The AA\nwas measured approximately 2 cm distal to the STJ. To verify the validity of the echocardiographic measurements of the aortic dimensions, random cases were re-measured by a second observer and the echocardiographic measurements compared to clinically indicated MRI measurements performed during the same episode of care in 42 patients.\nThree aortic phenotypes were de ﬁ ned for all groups: (1) normal shape: Valsalva sinuses &lt;37 mm and AA&lt;Valsalva; (2) predomin- ant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (Valsalva ≥ 37 mm and Valsalva&gt;AA); (3) predominant dilatation of the AA (AA ≥ 37 mm and AA&gt;Valsalva) ( ﬁ gure 1B). Measurements were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Yearly dilatation rates were calculated as: [diameter 2 – diameter 1]/time interval in years.\nExpected diameters of the sinuses of Valsalva and STJ at base- line and follow-up were calculated from Roman ’ s equations 23 using age and the body surface area (BSA) of the BAV popula- tion, allowing for the calculation of an expected dilatation rate. Patients were identi ﬁ ed as ‘ rapid progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was within the upper quartile for that aortic segment (annulus, Valsalva sinuses, STJ, and AA) and as ‘ non-progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was in the lower quartile.\n\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean±SD or percentage as appropriate. Baseline and follow-up values were compared using paired t test and the observed dilatation rate was compared to the expected dila- tation rate using Student t test. Comparisons between BAV, MFS, and DA used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non- parametric Wilcoxon test (in cases of signi ﬁ cance, two by two com- parisons were tested using Student t test and post-hoc Tukey ana- lysis). Among patients with BAV, the aortic patterns and subtypes of BAV were compared using ANOVA. To de ﬁ ne an independent asso- ciation, multivariate analyses were performed adjusting for signi ﬁ - cant univariable predictors. Univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of rapid progression. Rapid progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the upper quartile for each aortic segment) were thus de ﬁ ned as ≥ 0.2 mm/ year, ≥ 0.34 mm/year, ≥ 0.4 mm/year, ≥ 0.6 mm/year, for annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, STJ, and AA, respectively. Non-progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the lower quartile) were de ﬁ ned as ≤ 0 mm/ year for all levels. Candidate variables were age, gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis at baseline, AR at baseline, type of aortic dilatation, and type of BAV. Odd ratios of rapid progression were calculated. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nBaseline characteristics in BAV patients\nBaseline characteristics are summarised in the upper two thirds of table 1. We enrolled 353 adults with BAV (male 72%) with baseline and follow-up echocardiograms separated by 3.6 ±1.2 years (1271 patient-years). Mean age was 48±15 years and mean BSA 1.98±0.2 m². BAV was typical with raphe in 204 (58%), typical without raphe in 57 (16%), atypical without raphe in 56 (16%), and atypical with raphe in 29 (8%). In seven patients (2%), while certainty on BAV was con ﬁ rmed, the typing was uncertain ( ﬁ gure 2, panel A, grey slice). Inter-observer echo- cardiographic variability was non-signi ﬁ cant and in the 42 patients with MRI during the same episode of care, measure- ments were similar to echocardiography for Valsalva sinuses (36.7 vs 36.5 mm, p=0.62) and AA (35.6 vs 35.9 mm, p=0.70).\nAR was observed in 246 (70%) BAV patients and was mild in 123, moderate in 117, and severe in six cases at baseline. Mean\nvena contracta was 2.3±2.2 mm. AR was due to cusp prolapse in 37%, degenerative disease in 24%, predominant annular enlargement in 24%, and indeterminate in 15%. Signi ﬁ cant aortic stenosis was observed in 51 (14%) patients (moderate in 44, severe in seven).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies at baseline\nBy design, compared to BAV patients, the group of 51 DA patients and 50 MFS patients were similar for gender, systolic blood pressure (all p=NS), and minimum follow-up time. Also,\nBSA was similar between groups ( p=0.59) but, as expected, their ages differed, with the youngest patients in the MFS group and the oldest in the DA group ( p&lt;0.0001, table 1). AR ≥ moderate was more frequent in BAV patients versus DA and MFS patients ( p&lt;0.0001), despite similar annular dia- meters and smaller Valsalva sinuses in BAV (table 1).\n\n\nAortic phenotype and BAV morphology/function at baseline\nComparisons between aortic phenotype and BAV morphology/ function at baseline are presented in table 2.

Patients with non-dilated aorta (normal shape) were younger with a smaller BSA compared to other aortic patterns, and the four types of BAV were equally distributed ( ﬁ gure 2B). Patients with predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation were more frequently men and had predominantly a typical BAV ( ﬁ gure 2C). In multivariate analysis, independent determinants of Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype were younger age (p=0.0001),\nmale gender (p&lt;0.0001), higher BSA (p=0.002), and the typical morphology of BAV (p=0.0001). AR ≥ moderate was not an inde- pendent determinant of the Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype.\nAortic diameters according to BAV subtypes are summarised in table 3. Independent predictors of aortic diameters at baseline were older age, male gender,higher BSA for all levels of the aorta, and the presence of AR ≥ moderate only at the level of the annulus. On multivariate analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, BSA,\n\n\nTable 1 Baseline aortic diameters and yearly aortic dilatation rates in patients with BAV, DA, and MFS\n*Indicates significant differences between BAV and DA.\n† Indicates significant differences between BAV and MFS.\n‡ Indicates significant differences between MFS and DA.\n§Indicates significant differences between baseline and follow-up diameters.\nLarger baseline aortic diameters in DA patients reflect the inclusion criteria of 40 mm for these patients versus 37 mm for BAV and MFS.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve; BP, blood pressure; DA, degenerative aortopathy; MFS, Marfan syndrome.\nFigure 2 Distribution of the type of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).

However, BAV had smaller Valsalva sinuses versus MFS and DA, and the AA was largest in DA versus BAV and\nMFS. Thus, the phenotype of aortic dilatation was different, involv- ing all segments in DA, involving preferentially Valsalva sinuses in MFS, and preferentially the AA in BAV. However, despite the prefer- ential AA dilatation in BAV (60% of BAV patients at baseline), 27% had predominant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (table 2).\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV patients\nBAV aortic dilatation rates per year, level and group are indicated in the lower third of table 1. During follow-up, aortic diameters\n\n\nTable 3 Baseline characteristics and yearly aortic dilatation rate according to BAV subtype\n*Significant difference between typical and atypical, regardless of raphe.\n† Significant difference between typical and atypical with raphe.\n‡ Significant difference between typical with raphe and other subgroups.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristics of BAV patients according to aortic phenotype\n*NS between Valsalva&gt;AA and AA&gt;Valsalva.\n‡ Significant for predominance of typical type in Valsalva&gt;AA phenotype.\nAA, ascending aorta; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\nsigni ﬁ cantly increased at all levels in patients with BAV (all p&lt;0.001, table 1) and yearly aortic dilatation rate increased from the aortic annulus to the AA (from 0.05±0.2 mm/year to 0.42±0.6 mm/year, respectively). The maximum dilation rate was 0.42±0.6 mm/year (median 0.3 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0 – 0.64) at the AA level. These dilatation rates were greater than expected yearly dilatation rates derived from Roman ’ s nomo- grams (0.08±0.3 mm/year for Valsalva sinuses ( p&lt;0.0001), and 0.07±0.2 mm/year for STJ ( p=0.005)). During follow-up, pre- scribed treatment was ACE inhibitors in 25% of cases, angioten- sin receptor blockers in 7%, and β -blockers in 32%. There was no independent association of the treatment with lower aortic dilatation progression rate (all p&gt;0.13).\nAnalysing determinants of aortic dilatation rate in BAV, the range (CI 10% to 90%) of dilatation rate was wide and increased from the annulus (0.3 mm) to Valsalva sinuses (0.6 mm), to the AA (1.0 mm). Baseline characteristics asso- ciated with greater maximum BAV aortic dilatation rate (any aortic level) were younger age and smaller aortic diameter at baseline; there was no association between aortic dilatation rate and gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis/ regurgitation at baseline, pattern of aortic dilatation, or type of BAV. The aortic dilatation rate in subgroups of BAV was unre- lated to morphology or the presence of raphe (table 3). We also evaluated predictors of progression for each segment. At the level of the annulus, no baseline parameter was associated with rapid progression. For Valsalva sinuses, rapid progression was associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.97 95% CI (0.96 to 0.99), p=0.007) and with the degree of AR at diagnosis (OR per mm of vena contracta: 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.3), p=0.03). For STJ, rapid progression was associated with smaller STJ dia- meters at baseline (OR per mm: 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.99), p=0.02) and tended to be associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.98 (0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). For AA, rapid progression was associated with lower AA diameter at baseline (OR per mm: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98), p=0.008) and tended to be asso- ciated with younger age (OR per year and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). Forcing the type of BAV into the model did not affect the results or show a morphology – dilatation rate link. Importantly, non-progressors could not be identi ﬁ ed from base- line aortic diameter, measured at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva ( p=0.34) or STJ ( p=0.23). Above the STJ, non- progressors had greater baseline aortic diameter ( p=0.03).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nContrasting aortic dilatation progression in BAV versus MFS versus DA, dilatation rates did not differ at the annulus level ( p=0.51) and the STJ level ( p=0.57). In contrast, the largest aortic dilatation rate was observed in MFS at the level of the Valsalva sinuses (0.49±0.5 mm/year (median 0.42 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0.13 – 0.8)) and in BAV at the AA level (both p&lt;0.03, table 1). Although occurring at different levels, these maximum aortic dilatation rates in MFS and BAV did not differ in mean magnitude and were greater than the maximum aortic dilatation rate in DA at any level ( p=0.02). However, despite similar mean progression of magnitude, the distribution of maximal aortic dilatation rate differed between patients with BAV and MFS ( ﬁ gure 3) and a larger percentage of patients with BAV (43% vs 20%, p=0.01) did not incur aortic dilatation during follow-up. At last follow-up, comparing aortic dimen- sions in BAV, MFS and DA, the aortic annulus was similar in all groups ( p=0.40) and the Valsalva sinuses (38±6, 44±6 and 41.8±6 mm) were different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), being largest in MFS and smallest in BAV. The STJ (32±5, 35\n±7, and 37.5±6 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in BAV. The AA (39±6, 34±7, and 45±4 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in MFS. Thus, the phenotype of Valsalva sinuses&gt;AA was present in 96% of MFS cases vs 30% of DA and 36% of BAV ( p&lt;0.0001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this collaborative tertiary referral US – European registry is the largest echocardiographic study evaluat- ing valvulo-aortic phenotypes, rates, and patterns of aortic dila- tation and their determinants in BAV patients. In addition, we compared for the ﬁ rst time progression in BAV to that of other aortopathies (MFS and DA) in patients of similar gender, sys- tolic blood pressure, and minimum interval to follow-up. The most important ﬁ nding of this study is that in patients with BAV, the fastest aortic dilatation rate is observed at the AA level (0.42 mm/year), is independent of BAV morphology, and is similar to the aortic dilatation rate observed in MFS patients at the level of the Valsalva sinuses. Secondly, the AA dilatation rate is heterogeneous in BAV patients, with signi ﬁ cantly more patients characterised as ‘ non-progressors ’ compared to MFS. These different phenotypic characteristics and different progres- sion patterns could be partially linked to the relatively low risk of aortic catastrophes in patients with BAV. 5 Thirdly, in patients with BAV, a normal aortic diameter at baseline does not predict a lower rate of dilatation (and vice versa), and determinants of rapid progression are lower age and smaller baseline aortic diameter, such that systematic aortic size follow-up is warranted in all patients with BAV, regardless of baseline measurement. This also has important research implications — trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dilatation rates would be most powerful when applied to younger patients with smaller base- line aortas. Fourthly, all BAV types can exhibit a non-dilated aorta but the most common site of dilation for all BAV types is the AA. Nevertheless, we corroborate the presence of a group of BAV patients with predominant dilatation of Valsalva sinuses, 16 24 characterised by a preponderance of typical BAV morphology and male gender. We expand knowledge within this notion by observing that a typical BAV independently pre- dicts baseline dilatation of the entire proximal aorta (annulus, sinuses, STJ), except AA. Finally, for the time interval studied, we show that BAV morphology is not associated with aortic dila- tation progression rates.\n\n\nBAV and the aorta\nIn patients with BAV, we observed three basic aortic phenotypes at baseline: (1) a normal shape, which was more common in younger patients; (2) a predominance of Valsalva sinus dilatation, which was observed mostly in males with typical BAV; (3) a predomin- ance of AA dilatation, which was independent of BAV morphology and was the most common pattern of aortic dilatation. Our large study reconciles the discordances between previously described predominant patterns of aortic dilatation in BAV, 6 7 13 – 16 and by showing not just a predominance of AA dilatation but different valvulo-aortic phenotypes, supports a genetically heterogeneous origin for BAV with dissimilar embryology. 25 The predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation in BAV or ‘ sinuses phenotype ’ was ﬁ rst described by Della Corte et al , 26 and the variable prevalence between their study and ours likely relates to different inclusion de ﬁ nitions.\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV\nIn BAV patients, the aortic dilatation rate was maximal at the AA level — 0.42 mm/year (two times greater than at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva) — and could not be predicted by the BAV type. In addition, the presence of aortic dilatation at baseline was not a risk factor for rapid aortic dilatation at any aortic level and younger patients tended to dilate more rapidly than older patients. These ﬁ ndings may seem to contradict previous reports in which older age and baseline aortic dilatation were predictors of aneurysm formation. 3 5 The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the current study evaluated intermediate term dilatation rates (within 3.6±1.2 years) while prior studies evaluated long term end points (ie, aneurysm formation) and not dilatation rates. Indeed, most patients with a dilated aorta at baseline were also older in the current study.\nRegarding factors associated with aortic dilatation rates, both typical BAV 15 and atypical BAV 27 have been suggested as predic- tors of faster aortic dilatation. Our large study is adequately powered to address this issue and could not detect a link between the BAV type and the rate of aortic dilatation. Furthermore, within each type of BAV, the aortic dilatation rate displayed a wide range, supporting the fact that risk strati ﬁ cation for aortic dilatation rate based on BAV morphology would be inadequate. We found no association between BAV dysfunction and aortic dilatation progression rates (except AR and Valsalva sinuses). Aortic stenosis has been linked to aneurysm forma- tion, 5 28 as a long term outcome. It is possible that aortic sten- osis is a marker of increased age, which in turn is related to development of aneurysms. In addition, there was a paucity (14%) of signi ﬁ cant stenosis in our BAV group. Although this paucity of stenosis favours the ‘ histological aortic weakness ’ concept in our study, there is clear evidence that non-stenotic BAVs are nonetheless intrinsically dysfunctional, generating sig- ni ﬁ cant ﬂ ow abnormalities that increase systolic shear stress in the aorta. 29 We hypothesise that both haemodynamic and histo- logical aspects are important. Moreover, it is likely that other yet unknown genetic and environmental factors are at play. Mean aortic dilatation rates were considerable in earlier reports,\nwith values ranging from 0.8 – 1.2 mm/year, 11 13 14 whereas we found a rate of 0.42 mm/year in our report, which is very similar to the 0.37 mm/year in the recent report from Thanassoulis et al. 15 Our interpretation of this difference is that improved measurement accuracy with enhanced imaging and more widespread use of systematic follow-up imaging by echo- cardiography yield more realistic progression rates in the recent era.\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nThe mean aortic dilatation rate in BAV patients was greater com- pared to that observed in DA patients, and similar to that observed in patients with MFS carrying an FBN1 mutation. Indeed, BAV and MFS aortas display similar histological features, so that it may be impossible to recognise the aetiology of aneur- ysms of the aorta based on histology alone. However, several differences between MFS and BAV can be emphasised. The maximal aortic dilatation rate is observed above the STJ in the population with BAV, whereas it is observed at the level of the Valsalva sinuses in the MFS population, suggesting different ana- tomic sites of aortic vulnerability. In addition, although mean aortic dilatation rates are similar in MFS and BAV, almost half of the BAV patients are non-progressors, whereas the majority of patients with MFS progress over time. In our study, AR was more frequent with BAV than with MFS or DA, despite larger sinuses of Valsalva in these latter aortopathies. Thus, AR in BAV is possibly a consequence of the abnormal valve rather than proximal aortic dilatation. Nevertheless, AR was associated with dilatation progression at the Valsalva sinuses level.\n\n\nStudy limitations and strengths\nThe design of our study is retrospective – observational and may be prone to bias. However, the large size of our study and pro- spective aortic measurement undertaken by an experienced observer (DD), with blinding of the aortic measurement to any clinical or outcome data, suggest the likelihood of bias is low. Furthermore, matching of groups (BAV, MFS, DA) in regard to factors that may affect aortic dilatation over time also minimises\nFigure 3 Comparative distribution of the aortic dilatation rate in the segment of the aorta more prone to dilatation. Tubular ascending aorta for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and sinuses of Valsalva in patients with Marfan syndrome.\nAlthough the mean value is similar\n(0.42 and 0.49 mm/year respectively),\nthe distribution of the population is very different.\nthe possibility of inter-group bias. However, baseline aortic diameter inclusion (larger for DA) and age difference (older for DA) could partially explain the maximum aortic dilatation rates in DA patients being smaller than in MFS and BAV. Also, we used actual blood pressure measurement and not ‘ history of hypertension ’ in our de ﬁ nitions, and the DA group likely has a higher prevalence of hypertension.\nObviously, we could not correct for age as different aortopa- thies are clinically recognised at variable ages of the patients. Age is likely a determinant of dilatation progression and thus limits the quantitative comparison between groups. Importantly, when matching patients with BAV and MFS for ages between 30 – 50 years (BAV 41.5±6, MFS 40.2±6; p=0.27), we observed no difference in maximal progression rate ( p=0.5) and corrobo- rated faster progression of sinuses for MFS and tubular ascend- ing for BAV ( p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the age groups are representative of current clinical practice for each aortopathy, therefore their quantitative comparison seems fair from the clin- ical perspective. Aortic measurements were performed by echo- cardiography which was consistently performed at baseline and follow-up, whereas CT or MRI imaging in accordance with current recommendations 30 was not consistently performed. Nevertheless, echocardiographic measurements remain the current standard of care 30 and in patients with concomitant MRI there was no detectable difference between techniques. Notwithstanding, analysis of aortic arch dimensions was not possible in this study. The results of this study are applicable only to adults ( ≥ 18 years) within a tertiary referral based prac- tice, and are not meant to represent the entire spectrum of MFS and DA, as these were matched by gender to patients with BAV. The conclusions of our study represent the observations made over a 25 – 75 centile interval time of 2.7 – 4.5 years and longer follow-up studies should be performed. Finally, the use of annualised aortic dilatation rates and lack of an intermediate measurement between the ﬁ rst and follow-up echocardiograms limit the analysis of more complex aortic growth attributes such as potential time dependent growth decelerations.\n\n\nClinical/research implications\nIn BAV patients, baseline AA dilatation is most common and independent of valve morphology, while baseline sinus of Valsalva dilatation is associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. The aortic dilatation rate is maximal at the AA, independent of valve function and morphology, and similar but not greater than that observed at the sinuses of Valsalva in patients with MFS. Thus, dilatation above the STJ should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The observed dilatation rates cannot be inferred from BAV morphology or baseline aortic diameter measured once, and therefore systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Furthermore, because the aortic dilatation rate may signi ﬁ cantly differ between individual patients, only speci ﬁ c follow-up measurements can determine individual size-dependent aortic risk. In addition, although there is an independent association between typical BAV and the predominant Valsalva sinus phenotype, the risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Aortic dilatation rates at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva are signi ﬁ cantly less prominent than AA, supporting a recent report 31 which indicates that preserving the Valsalva sinuses at the time of AA replacement in patients with BAV and no signi ﬁ - cant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses, was not associated with reintervention due to progressive dilatation of Valsalva sinuses at follow-up. Trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dila- tation rates would be most revealing when applied to younger\npatients with smaller baseline aortas. Lastly, the dilatation rate heterogeneity and its independence from BAV morphology suggest a higher level of complexity in genetic and environmen- tal determinants of BAV aortopathy, which need to be determined.\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\nWhat is already known about this subject\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with aortic dilatation. Patterns of dilatation are not well de ﬁ ned and comparison with other aortopathies is lacking.\n\n\nWhat does this study add\nIn BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Sinuses growth rate is slower. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict the progression rate. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV and Marfan syndrome, but a signi ﬁ cantly higher BAV patient proportion does not progress at all.\n\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice\nDilatation above the sinotubular junction should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Surgical preservation of a normal aortic sinuses appears theoretically reasonable. Aortic dilatation patterns are different between BAV and Marfan syndrome patients.\nContributors All authors contributed to: conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and ﬁ nal approval of the version published.\nFunding PHRC AOM09093 (GJ), ANR 2010 BLAN 1129 from the French National Research Agency (GJ).\nCompeting interests None.\nEthics approval Institutional Review Boards of participating centres.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\n\n\nEditor ’ s choice Scan to access more free content 126 Detaint D, et al .

We sought to de ﬁ ne ascending aorta dilatation patterns/ progression rates in BAV versus other aortopathies (Marfan syndrome (MFS), degenerative aortopathy (DA)). Design and setting Retrospective, observational study. Aortic dilatation progression was evaluated in two tertiary care centres (US and European) by repeated echocardiography ≥ 2 years apart in adults with BAV (n=353), matched to MFS (n=50) and DA (n=51) for gender, blood pressure, and minimum follow-up time. Results At baseline, ascending aortic dilatation was present in 87% of BAV cases: tubular ascending aorta in 60% (irrespective of BAV morphology), and Valsalva sinuses dilatation in 27% (independently linked to typical BAV morphology and male gender ( p=0.0001)). After 3.6±1.2 years, the aortic dilatation rate in BAV was higher than expected for the population for all aortic levels ( p=0.005) and was maximal at the tubular ascending aorta for BAV (0.42±0.6 mm/year) and DA (0.20±0.3 mm/year), and was maximal at the Valsalva sinuses for MFS (0.49±0.5 mm/year). Maximal aortic dilatation rate was similar between BAV and MFS ( p&gt;0.40) and lower in DA ( p=0.02) but was heterogeneous in BAV, with 43% of BAV not progressing (vs 20% of MFS, p=0.01). Aortic dilatation rate was not proportionally related to baseline aortic size or BAV type (all models p&gt;0.40).\nConclusions In patients with BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses is less common and associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV (tubular segment) and MFS (Valsalva sinuses), but a signi ﬁ cantly higher proportion of BAV patients does not progress at all, irrespective of BAV type. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict progression rate; systematic follow-up is therefore warranted in patients with BAV.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital abnormality with a prevalence of 1.3%. 1 BAV is associated with endocarditis 2 and premature aortic valve dysfunction. 3 4 However, BAV is not just a valvular disorder but also an aortopathy, with aortic dilatation and risk of aortic dissection and\nrupture. 5 Valvular dysfunction may play a role in the development of aortic abnormalities, but aortic dilatation is often out of proportion to the degree of valvular dysfunction, 6 7 suggesting an intrinsic aortic tissue abnormality. Indeed, BAV studies have reported structural abnormalities of thoracic aortic tissue, including decreased ﬁ brillin, elastin fragmen- tation, matrix disruption, and apoptosis. 8 9 These similarities to Marfan syndrome (MFS) led the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association to recommend aggressive elective aortic surgery for BAV patients with aortic dilatation or sooner as possible for ‘ rapid progressors ’ . 10\nHowever, there are considerable uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that in BAV patients the risk of aortic catastrophes, although higher than in the general population, remains low. 4 5 Additionally, reports of aortic dilatation progression involved limited sample sizes and paediatric populations, 11 12 and resulted in discordant progression rates 13 – 15 with variable association with BAV function and morphology. Additionally, patterns of aortic dilata- tion with BAV were variably reported as predomin- antly involving the tubular ascending aorta (AA), 16 the Valsalva sinuses and proximal AA, 6 or as balanced, 7 and were not compared to those of MFS. The controversies regarding aortic imaging similarities and differences between various types of aortopathies (BAV, MFS, and degenerative aorto- pathy (DA)) in regard to progression rates and pat- terns of aortic dilatation are unresolved. 17 To address these controversies, we studied a large population of patients with BAV who were fol- lowed for at least 2 years at two large European and US centres, analysed aortic dilatation patterns, rates and their determinants, and as a secondary aim, compared BAV to other aortopathies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards for each institution. We identi ﬁ ed patients in two tertiary referral centres (Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and Bichat Hospital, Paris, France) with the conditions listed below, who had echocardiograms between 2003 and 2008 and the latest follow-up echocardiogram performed at least 2 years later. Three different patients groups were assembled:\nBAV patients : Adults (age ≥ 18 years) with BAV identi ﬁ ed by echocardiography were included. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery\n(except for aortic coarctation repair) or aortic dissection or the diagnoses of MFS or other severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction.\nDA patients : Adults were included if they had a tricuspid aortic valve with dilatation of the sinuses or AA (diameter &gt;40 mm) determined by echocardiogram. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, MFS, or severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 51 patients were matched to BAV patients for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\nMFS patients : Adults were included from the French Marfan and Associated Disease Centre, provided they ful ﬁ lled inter- national criteria 18 including a mutation in the FBN1 gene and had a tricuspid aortic valve at echocardiography. Exclusion cri- teria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, and severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 50 patients were matched to patients with BAV for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\n\n\nEchocardiography\nAll patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardi- ography evaluation at baseline and at follow-up. All echocardio- grams were prospectively reviewed blindly of diagnosis by an experienced observer (DD) to ensure homogeneity in the aorta measurements in both centres. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by 2D echocardiography 19 including visual estima- tion. 20 Diagnosis of BAV was based on parasternal short axis imaging of the aortic valve using either transthoracic echocardi- ography or transoesophageal echocardiography at 45°, requiring the presence of only two commissures delimiting only two aortic cusps. Bicuspid valves were classi ﬁ ed as typical (anterior and posterior cusps) when the commissures were at 4 – 10, 5 – 11 or 3 – 9 o ’ clock, and atypical (right and left cusps) when the commissures were at 1 – 7 or 12 – 6 o ’ clock ( ﬁ gure 1A). The pres- ence of a raphe was recorded. Hence, four main types were identi ﬁ ed; typical with and without raphe and atypical with and without raphe. 3 16\nAortic valve function was evaluated using Doppler methods: aortic stenosis severity was assessed by the transaortic mean gradi- ent and the aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation. Aortic stenosis was de ﬁ ned as severe when the aortic valve area (AVA) was ≤ 1 cm² or mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, and as moderate when the AVA was 1 – 1.5 cm² and mean gradient 25 – 40 mm Hg. 10\nMeasurements of the aortic annulus were performed in early systole, parasternal long axis view zoomed on the left ventricular out ﬂ ow tract, inner edge to inner edge, at insertion points of the aortic cusps. Aortic regurgitation (AR) evaluation 21 was based on American Society of Echocardiography criteria, with classi ﬁ cation as ≤ mild, moderate, and &gt;moderate using colour Doppler jet width and extension, vena contracta width measurement and, when possible, quantitative measurements using the proximal iso- velocity surface area method. The aetiology of AR was classi ﬁ ed as: cusp prolapse, cusp degeneration (cusp thickening and restric- tion), predominant annular enlargement, or indeterminate.\nAll measurements of the aorta were performed by the same investigator (DD) according to recommendations and on the QRS complex of the ECG. 22 23 The dimensions of the Valsalva sinuses were measured perpendicular to the right and left (or non-) aortic sinuses. The sinotubular junction (STJ) was mea- sured where the aortic sinuses met the tubular aorta. The AA\nwas measured approximately 2 cm distal to the STJ. To verify the validity of the echocardiographic measurements of the aortic dimensions, random cases were re-measured by a second observer and the echocardiographic measurements compared to clinically indicated MRI measurements performed during the same episode of care in 42 patients.\nThree aortic phenotypes were de ﬁ ned for all groups: (1) normal shape: Valsalva sinuses &lt;37 mm and AA&lt;Valsalva; (2) predomin- ant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (Valsalva ≥ 37 mm and Valsalva&gt;AA); (3) predominant dilatation of the AA (AA ≥ 37 mm and AA&gt;Valsalva) ( ﬁ gure 1B). Measurements were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Yearly dilatation rates were calculated as: [diameter 2 – diameter 1]/time interval in years.\nExpected diameters of the sinuses of Valsalva and STJ at base- line and follow-up were calculated from Roman ’ s equations 23 using age and the body surface area (BSA) of the BAV popula- tion, allowing for the calculation of an expected dilatation rate. Patients were identi ﬁ ed as ‘ rapid progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was within the upper quartile for that aortic segment (annulus, Valsalva sinuses, STJ, and AA) and as ‘ non-progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was in the lower quartile.\n\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean±SD or percentage as appropriate. Baseline and follow-up values were compared using paired t test and the observed dilatation rate was compared to the expected dila- tation rate using Student t test. Comparisons between BAV, MFS, and DA used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non- parametric Wilcoxon test (in cases of signi ﬁ cance, two by two com- parisons were tested using Student t test and post-hoc Tukey ana- lysis). Among patients with BAV, the aortic patterns and subtypes of BAV were compared using ANOVA. To de ﬁ ne an independent asso- ciation, multivariate analyses were performed adjusting for signi ﬁ - cant univariable predictors. Univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of rapid progression. Rapid progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the upper quartile for each aortic segment) were thus de ﬁ ned as ≥ 0.2 mm/ year, ≥ 0.34 mm/year, ≥ 0.4 mm/year, ≥ 0.6 mm/year, for annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, STJ, and AA, respectively. Non-progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the lower quartile) were de ﬁ ned as ≤ 0 mm/ year for all levels. Candidate variables were age, gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis at baseline, AR at baseline, type of aortic dilatation, and type of BAV. Odd ratios of rapid progression were calculated. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nBaseline characteristics in BAV patients\nBaseline characteristics are summarised in the upper two thirds of table 1. We enrolled 353 adults with BAV (male 72%) with baseline and follow-up echocardiograms separated by 3.6 ±1.2 years (1271 patient-years). Mean age was 48±15 years and mean BSA 1.98±0.2 m². BAV was typical with raphe in 204 (58%), typical without raphe in 57 (16%), atypical without raphe in 56 (16%), and atypical with raphe in 29 (8%). In seven patients (2%), while certainty on BAV was con ﬁ rmed, the typing was uncertain ( ﬁ gure 2, panel A, grey slice). Inter-observer echo- cardiographic variability was non-signi ﬁ cant and in the 42 patients with MRI during the same episode of care, measure- ments were similar to echocardiography for Valsalva sinuses (36.7 vs 36.5 mm, p=0.62) and AA (35.6 vs 35.9 mm, p=0.70).\nAR was observed in 246 (70%) BAV patients and was mild in 123, moderate in 117, and severe in six cases at baseline. Mean\nvena contracta was 2.3±2.2 mm. AR was due to cusp prolapse in 37%, degenerative disease in 24%, predominant annular enlargement in 24%, and indeterminate in 15%. Signi ﬁ cant aortic stenosis was observed in 51 (14%) patients (moderate in 44, severe in seven).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies at baseline\nBy design, compared to BAV patients, the group of 51 DA patients and 50 MFS patients were similar for gender, systolic blood pressure (all p=NS), and minimum follow-up time. Also,\nBSA was similar between groups ( p=0.59) but, as expected, their ages differed, with the youngest patients in the MFS group and the oldest in the DA group ( p&lt;0.0001, table 1). AR ≥ moderate was more frequent in BAV patients versus DA and MFS patients ( p&lt;0.0001), despite similar annular dia- meters and smaller Valsalva sinuses in BAV (table 1).\n\n\nAortic phenotype and BAV morphology/function at baseline\nComparisons between aortic phenotype and BAV morphology/ function at baseline are presented in table 2.

Patients with non-dilated aorta (normal shape) were younger with a smaller BSA compared to other aortic patterns, and the four types of BAV were equally distributed ( ﬁ gure 2B). Patients with predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation were more frequently men and had predominantly a typical BAV ( ﬁ gure 2C). In multivariate analysis, independent determinants of Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype were younger age (p=0.0001),\nmale gender (p&lt;0.0001), higher BSA (p=0.002), and the typical morphology of BAV (p=0.0001). AR ≥ moderate was not an inde- pendent determinant of the Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype.\nAortic diameters according to BAV subtypes are summarised in table 3. Independent predictors of aortic diameters at baseline were older age, male gender,higher BSA for all levels of the aorta, and the presence of AR ≥ moderate only at the level of the annulus. On multivariate analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, BSA,\n\n\nTable 1 Baseline aortic diameters and yearly aortic dilatation rates in patients with BAV, DA, and MFS\n*Indicates significant differences between BAV and DA.\n† Indicates significant differences between BAV and MFS.\n‡ Indicates significant differences between MFS and DA.\n§Indicates significant differences between baseline and follow-up diameters.\nLarger baseline aortic diameters in DA patients reflect the inclusion criteria of 40 mm for these patients versus 37 mm for BAV and MFS.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve; BP, blood pressure; DA, degenerative aortopathy; MFS, Marfan syndrome.\nFigure 2 Distribution of the type of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).

However, BAV had smaller Valsalva sinuses versus MFS and DA, and the AA was largest in DA versus BAV and\nMFS. Thus, the phenotype of aortic dilatation was different, involv- ing all segments in DA, involving preferentially Valsalva sinuses in MFS, and preferentially the AA in BAV. However, despite the prefer- ential AA dilatation in BAV (60% of BAV patients at baseline), 27% had predominant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (table 2).\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV patients\nBAV aortic dilatation rates per year, level and group are indicated in the lower third of table 1. During follow-up, aortic diameters\n\n\nTable 3 Baseline characteristics and yearly aortic dilatation rate according to BAV subtype\n*Significant difference between typical and atypical, regardless of raphe.\n† Significant difference between typical and atypical with raphe.\n‡ Significant difference between typical with raphe and other subgroups.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristics of BAV patients according to aortic phenotype\n*NS between Valsalva&gt;AA and AA&gt;Valsalva.\n‡ Significant for predominance of typical type in Valsalva&gt;AA phenotype.\nAA, ascending aorta; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\nsigni ﬁ cantly increased at all levels in patients with BAV (all p&lt;0.001, table 1) and yearly aortic dilatation rate increased from the aortic annulus to the AA (from 0.05±0.2 mm/year to 0.42±0.6 mm/year, respectively). The maximum dilation rate was 0.42±0.6 mm/year (median 0.3 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0 – 0.64) at the AA level. These dilatation rates were greater than expected yearly dilatation rates derived from Roman ’ s nomo- grams (0.08±0.3 mm/year for Valsalva sinuses ( p&lt;0.0001), and 0.07±0.2 mm/year for STJ ( p=0.005)). During follow-up, pre- scribed treatment was ACE inhibitors in 25% of cases, angioten- sin receptor blockers in 7%, and β -blockers in 32%. There was no independent association of the treatment with lower aortic dilatation progression rate (all p&gt;0.13).\nAnalysing determinants of aortic dilatation rate in BAV, the range (CI 10% to 90%) of dilatation rate was wide and increased from the annulus (0.3 mm) to Valsalva sinuses (0.6 mm), to the AA (1.0 mm). Baseline characteristics asso- ciated with greater maximum BAV aortic dilatation rate (any aortic level) were younger age and smaller aortic diameter at baseline; there was no association between aortic dilatation rate and gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis/ regurgitation at baseline, pattern of aortic dilatation, or type of BAV. The aortic dilatation rate in subgroups of BAV was unre- lated to morphology or the presence of raphe (table 3). We also evaluated predictors of progression for each segment. At the level of the annulus, no baseline parameter was associated with rapid progression. For Valsalva sinuses, rapid progression was associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.97 95% CI (0.96 to 0.99), p=0.007) and with the degree of AR at diagnosis (OR per mm of vena contracta: 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.3), p=0.03). For STJ, rapid progression was associated with smaller STJ dia- meters at baseline (OR per mm: 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.99), p=0.02) and tended to be associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.98 (0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). For AA, rapid progression was associated with lower AA diameter at baseline (OR per mm: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98), p=0.008) and tended to be asso- ciated with younger age (OR per year and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). Forcing the type of BAV into the model did not affect the results or show a morphology – dilatation rate link. Importantly, non-progressors could not be identi ﬁ ed from base- line aortic diameter, measured at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva ( p=0.34) or STJ ( p=0.23). Above the STJ, non- progressors had greater baseline aortic diameter ( p=0.03).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nContrasting aortic dilatation progression in BAV versus MFS versus DA, dilatation rates did not differ at the annulus level ( p=0.51) and the STJ level ( p=0.57). In contrast, the largest aortic dilatation rate was observed in MFS at the level of the Valsalva sinuses (0.49±0.5 mm/year (median 0.42 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0.13 – 0.8)) and in BAV at the AA level (both p&lt;0.03, table 1). Although occurring at different levels, these maximum aortic dilatation rates in MFS and BAV did not differ in mean magnitude and were greater than the maximum aortic dilatation rate in DA at any level ( p=0.02). However, despite similar mean progression of magnitude, the distribution of maximal aortic dilatation rate differed between patients with BAV and MFS ( ﬁ gure 3) and a larger percentage of patients with BAV (43% vs 20%, p=0.01) did not incur aortic dilatation during follow-up. At last follow-up, comparing aortic dimen- sions in BAV, MFS and DA, the aortic annulus was similar in all groups ( p=0.40) and the Valsalva sinuses (38±6, 44±6 and 41.8±6 mm) were different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), being largest in MFS and smallest in BAV. The STJ (32±5, 35\n±7, and 37.5±6 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in BAV. The AA (39±6, 34±7, and 45±4 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in MFS. Thus, the phenotype of Valsalva sinuses&gt;AA was present in 96% of MFS cases vs 30% of DA and 36% of BAV ( p&lt;0.0001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this collaborative tertiary referral US – European registry is the largest echocardiographic study evaluat- ing valvulo-aortic phenotypes, rates, and patterns of aortic dila- tation and their determinants in BAV patients. In addition, we compared for the ﬁ rst time progression in BAV to that of other aortopathies (MFS and DA) in patients of similar gender, sys- tolic blood pressure, and minimum interval to follow-up. The most important ﬁ nding of this study is that in patients with BAV, the fastest aortic dilatation rate is observed at the AA level (0.42 mm/year), is independent of BAV morphology, and is similar to the aortic dilatation rate observed in MFS patients at the level of the Valsalva sinuses. Secondly, the AA dilatation rate is heterogeneous in BAV patients, with signi ﬁ cantly more patients characterised as ‘ non-progressors ’ compared to MFS. These different phenotypic characteristics and different progres- sion patterns could be partially linked to the relatively low risk of aortic catastrophes in patients with BAV. 5 Thirdly, in patients with BAV, a normal aortic diameter at baseline does not predict a lower rate of dilatation (and vice versa), and determinants of rapid progression are lower age and smaller baseline aortic diameter, such that systematic aortic size follow-up is warranted in all patients with BAV, regardless of baseline measurement. This also has important research implications — trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dilatation rates would be most powerful when applied to younger patients with smaller base- line aortas. Fourthly, all BAV types can exhibit a non-dilated aorta but the most common site of dilation for all BAV types is the AA. Nevertheless, we corroborate the presence of a group of BAV patients with predominant dilatation of Valsalva sinuses, 16 24 characterised by a preponderance of typical BAV morphology and male gender. We expand knowledge within this notion by observing that a typical BAV independently pre- dicts baseline dilatation of the entire proximal aorta (annulus, sinuses, STJ), except AA. Finally, for the time interval studied, we show that BAV morphology is not associated with aortic dila- tation progression rates.\n\n\nBAV and the aorta\nIn patients with BAV, we observed three basic aortic phenotypes at baseline: (1) a normal shape, which was more common in younger patients; (2) a predominance of Valsalva sinus dilatation, which was observed mostly in males with typical BAV; (3) a predomin- ance of AA dilatation, which was independent of BAV morphology and was the most common pattern of aortic dilatation. Our large study reconciles the discordances between previously described predominant patterns of aortic dilatation in BAV, 6 7 13 – 16 and by showing not just a predominance of AA dilatation but different valvulo-aortic phenotypes, supports a genetically heterogeneous origin for BAV with dissimilar embryology. 25 The predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation in BAV or ‘ sinuses phenotype ’ was ﬁ rst described by Della Corte et al , 26 and the variable prevalence between their study and ours likely relates to different inclusion de ﬁ nitions.\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV\nIn BAV patients, the aortic dilatation rate was maximal at the AA level — 0.42 mm/year (two times greater than at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva) — and could not be predicted by the BAV type. In addition, the presence of aortic dilatation at baseline was not a risk factor for rapid aortic dilatation at any aortic level and younger patients tended to dilate more rapidly than older patients. These ﬁ ndings may seem to contradict previous reports in which older age and baseline aortic dilatation were predictors of aneurysm formation. 3 5 The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the current study evaluated intermediate term dilatation rates (within 3.6±1.2 years) while prior studies evaluated long term end points (ie, aneurysm formation) and not dilatation rates. Indeed, most patients with a dilated aorta at baseline were also older in the current study.\nRegarding factors associated with aortic dilatation rates, both typical BAV 15 and atypical BAV 27 have been suggested as predic- tors of faster aortic dilatation. Our large study is adequately powered to address this issue and could not detect a link between the BAV type and the rate of aortic dilatation. Furthermore, within each type of BAV, the aortic dilatation rate displayed a wide range, supporting the fact that risk strati ﬁ cation for aortic dilatation rate based on BAV morphology would be inadequate. We found no association between BAV dysfunction and aortic dilatation progression rates (except AR and Valsalva sinuses). Aortic stenosis has been linked to aneurysm forma- tion, 5 28 as a long term outcome. It is possible that aortic sten- osis is a marker of increased age, which in turn is related to development of aneurysms. In addition, there was a paucity (14%) of signi ﬁ cant stenosis in our BAV group. Although this paucity of stenosis favours the ‘ histological aortic weakness ’ concept in our study, there is clear evidence that non-stenotic BAVs are nonetheless intrinsically dysfunctional, generating sig- ni ﬁ cant ﬂ ow abnormalities that increase systolic shear stress in the aorta. 29 We hypothesise that both haemodynamic and histo- logical aspects are important. Moreover, it is likely that other yet unknown genetic and environmental factors are at play. Mean aortic dilatation rates were considerable in earlier reports,\nwith values ranging from 0.8 – 1.2 mm/year, 11 13 14 whereas we found a rate of 0.42 mm/year in our report, which is very similar to the 0.37 mm/year in the recent report from Thanassoulis et al. 15 Our interpretation of this difference is that improved measurement accuracy with enhanced imaging and more widespread use of systematic follow-up imaging by echo- cardiography yield more realistic progression rates in the recent era.\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nThe mean aortic dilatation rate in BAV patients was greater com- pared to that observed in DA patients, and similar to that observed in patients with MFS carrying an FBN1 mutation. Indeed, BAV and MFS aortas display similar histological features, so that it may be impossible to recognise the aetiology of aneur- ysms of the aorta based on histology alone. However, several differences between MFS and BAV can be emphasised. The maximal aortic dilatation rate is observed above the STJ in the population with BAV, whereas it is observed at the level of the Valsalva sinuses in the MFS population, suggesting different ana- tomic sites of aortic vulnerability. In addition, although mean aortic dilatation rates are similar in MFS and BAV, almost half of the BAV patients are non-progressors, whereas the majority of patients with MFS progress over time. In our study, AR was more frequent with BAV than with MFS or DA, despite larger sinuses of Valsalva in these latter aortopathies. Thus, AR in BAV is possibly a consequence of the abnormal valve rather than proximal aortic dilatation. Nevertheless, AR was associated with dilatation progression at the Valsalva sinuses level.\n\n\nStudy limitations and strengths\nThe design of our study is retrospective – observational and may be prone to bias. However, the large size of our study and pro- spective aortic measurement undertaken by an experienced observer (DD), with blinding of the aortic measurement to any clinical or outcome data, suggest the likelihood of bias is low. Furthermore, matching of groups (BAV, MFS, DA) in regard to factors that may affect aortic dilatation over time also minimises\nFigure 3 Comparative distribution of the aortic dilatation rate in the segment of the aorta more prone to dilatation. Tubular ascending aorta for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and sinuses of Valsalva in patients with Marfan syndrome.\nAlthough the mean value is similar\n(0.42 and 0.49 mm/year respectively),\nthe distribution of the population is very different.\nthe possibility of inter-group bias. However, baseline aortic diameter inclusion (larger for DA) and age difference (older for DA) could partially explain the maximum aortic dilatation rates in DA patients being smaller than in MFS and BAV. Also, we used actual blood pressure measurement and not ‘ history of hypertension ’ in our de ﬁ nitions, and the DA group likely has a higher prevalence of hypertension.\nObviously, we could not correct for age as different aortopa- thies are clinically recognised at variable ages of the patients. Age is likely a determinant of dilatation progression and thus limits the quantitative comparison between groups. Importantly, when matching patients with BAV and MFS for ages between 30 – 50 years (BAV 41.5±6, MFS 40.2±6; p=0.27), we observed no difference in maximal progression rate ( p=0.5) and corrobo- rated faster progression of sinuses for MFS and tubular ascend- ing for BAV ( p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the age groups are representative of current clinical practice for each aortopathy, therefore their quantitative comparison seems fair from the clin- ical perspective. Aortic measurements were performed by echo- cardiography which was consistently performed at baseline and follow-up, whereas CT or MRI imaging in accordance with current recommendations 30 was not consistently performed. Nevertheless, echocardiographic measurements remain the current standard of care 30 and in patients with concomitant MRI there was no detectable difference between techniques. Notwithstanding, analysis of aortic arch dimensions was not possible in this study. The results of this study are applicable only to adults ( ≥ 18 years) within a tertiary referral based prac- tice, and are not meant to represent the entire spectrum of MFS and DA, as these were matched by gender to patients with BAV. The conclusions of our study represent the observations made over a 25 – 75 centile interval time of 2.7 – 4.5 years and longer follow-up studies should be performed. Finally, the use of annualised aortic dilatation rates and lack of an intermediate measurement between the ﬁ rst and follow-up echocardiograms limit the analysis of more complex aortic growth attributes such as potential time dependent growth decelerations.\n\n\nClinical/research implications\nIn BAV patients, baseline AA dilatation is most common and independent of valve morphology, while baseline sinus of Valsalva dilatation is associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. The aortic dilatation rate is maximal at the AA, independent of valve function and morphology, and similar but not greater than that observed at the sinuses of Valsalva in patients with MFS. Thus, dilatation above the STJ should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The observed dilatation rates cannot be inferred from BAV morphology or baseline aortic diameter measured once, and therefore systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Furthermore, because the aortic dilatation rate may signi ﬁ cantly differ between individual patients, only speci ﬁ c follow-up measurements can determine individual size-dependent aortic risk. In addition, although there is an independent association between typical BAV and the predominant Valsalva sinus phenotype, the risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Aortic dilatation rates at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva are signi ﬁ cantly less prominent than AA, supporting a recent report 31 which indicates that preserving the Valsalva sinuses at the time of AA replacement in patients with BAV and no signi ﬁ - cant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses, was not associated with reintervention due to progressive dilatation of Valsalva sinuses at follow-up. Trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dila- tation rates would be most revealing when applied to younger\npatients with smaller baseline aortas. Lastly, the dilatation rate heterogeneity and its independence from BAV morphology suggest a higher level of complexity in genetic and environmen- tal determinants of BAV aortopathy, which need to be determined.\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\nWhat is already known about this subject\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with aortic dilatation. Patterns of dilatation are not well de ﬁ ned and comparison with other aortopathies is lacking.\n\n\nWhat does this study add\nIn BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Sinuses growth rate is slower. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict the progression rate. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV and Marfan syndrome, but a signi ﬁ cantly higher BAV patient proportion does not progress at all.\n\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice\nDilatation above the sinotubular junction should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Surgical preservation of a normal aortic sinuses appears theoretically reasonable. Aortic dilatation patterns are different between BAV and Marfan syndrome patients.\nContributors All authors contributed to: conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and ﬁ nal approval of the version published.\nFunding PHRC AOM09093 (GJ), ANR 2010 BLAN 1129 from the French National Research Agency (GJ).\nCompeting interests None.\nEthics approval Institutional Review Boards of participating centres.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\n\n\nEditor ’ s choice Scan to access more free content 126 Detaint D, et al .

We sought to de ﬁ ne ascending aorta dilatation patterns/ progression rates in BAV versus other aortopathies (Marfan syndrome (MFS), degenerative aortopathy (DA)). Design and setting Retrospective, observational study. Aortic dilatation progression was evaluated in two tertiary care centres (US and European) by repeated echocardiography ≥ 2 years apart in adults with BAV (n=353), matched to MFS (n=50) and DA (n=51) for gender, blood pressure, and minimum follow-up time. Results At baseline, ascending aortic dilatation was present in 87% of BAV cases: tubular ascending aorta in 60% (irrespective of BAV morphology), and Valsalva sinuses dilatation in 27% (independently linked to typical BAV morphology and male gender ( p=0.0001)). After 3.6±1.2 years, the aortic dilatation rate in BAV was higher than expected for the population for all aortic levels ( p=0.005) and was maximal at the tubular ascending aorta for BAV (0.42±0.6 mm/year) and DA (0.20±0.3 mm/year), and was maximal at the Valsalva sinuses for MFS (0.49±0.5 mm/year). Maximal aortic dilatation rate was similar between BAV and MFS ( p&gt;0.40) and lower in DA ( p=0.02) but was heterogeneous in BAV, with 43% of BAV not progressing (vs 20% of MFS, p=0.01). Aortic dilatation rate was not proportionally related to baseline aortic size or BAV type (all models p&gt;0.40).\nConclusions In patients with BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses is less common and associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV (tubular segment) and MFS (Valsalva sinuses), but a signi ﬁ cantly higher proportion of BAV patients does not progress at all, irrespective of BAV type. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict progression rate; systematic follow-up is therefore warranted in patients with BAV.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital abnormality with a prevalence of 1.3%. 1 BAV is associated with endocarditis 2 and premature aortic valve dysfunction. 3 4 However, BAV is not just a valvular disorder but also an aortopathy, with aortic dilatation and risk of aortic dissection and\nrupture. 5 Valvular dysfunction may play a role in the development of aortic abnormalities, but aortic dilatation is often out of proportion to the degree of valvular dysfunction, 6 7 suggesting an intrinsic aortic tissue abnormality. Indeed, BAV studies have reported structural abnormalities of thoracic aortic tissue, including decreased ﬁ brillin, elastin fragmen- tation, matrix disruption, and apoptosis. 8 9 These similarities to Marfan syndrome (MFS) led the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association to recommend aggressive elective aortic surgery for BAV patients with aortic dilatation or sooner as possible for ‘ rapid progressors ’ . 10\nHowever, there are considerable uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that in BAV patients the risk of aortic catastrophes, although higher than in the general population, remains low. 4 5 Additionally, reports of aortic dilatation progression involved limited sample sizes and paediatric populations, 11 12 and resulted in discordant progression rates 13 – 15 with variable association with BAV function and morphology. Additionally, patterns of aortic dilata- tion with BAV were variably reported as predomin- antly involving the tubular ascending aorta (AA), 16 the Valsalva sinuses and proximal AA, 6 or as balanced, 7 and were not compared to those of MFS. The controversies regarding aortic imaging similarities and differences between various types of aortopathies (BAV, MFS, and degenerative aorto- pathy (DA)) in regard to progression rates and pat- terns of aortic dilatation are unresolved. 17 To address these controversies, we studied a large population of patients with BAV who were fol- lowed for at least 2 years at two large European and US centres, analysed aortic dilatation patterns, rates and their determinants, and as a secondary aim, compared BAV to other aortopathies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards for each institution. We identi ﬁ ed patients in two tertiary referral centres (Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and Bichat Hospital, Paris, France) with the conditions listed below, who had echocardiograms between 2003 and 2008 and the latest follow-up echocardiogram performed at least 2 years later. Three different patients groups were assembled:\nBAV patients : Adults (age ≥ 18 years) with BAV identi ﬁ ed by echocardiography were included. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery\n(except for aortic coarctation repair) or aortic dissection or the diagnoses of MFS or other severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction.\nDA patients : Adults were included if they had a tricuspid aortic valve with dilatation of the sinuses or AA (diameter &gt;40 mm) determined by echocardiogram. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, MFS, or severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 51 patients were matched to BAV patients for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\nMFS patients : Adults were included from the French Marfan and Associated Disease Centre, provided they ful ﬁ lled inter- national criteria 18 including a mutation in the FBN1 gene and had a tricuspid aortic valve at echocardiography. Exclusion cri- teria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, and severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 50 patients were matched to patients with BAV for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\n\n\nEchocardiography\nAll patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardi- ography evaluation at baseline and at follow-up. All echocardio- grams were prospectively reviewed blindly of diagnosis by an experienced observer (DD) to ensure homogeneity in the aorta measurements in both centres. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by 2D echocardiography 19 including visual estima- tion. 20 Diagnosis of BAV was based on parasternal short axis imaging of the aortic valve using either transthoracic echocardi- ography or transoesophageal echocardiography at 45°, requiring the presence of only two commissures delimiting only two aortic cusps. Bicuspid valves were classi ﬁ ed as typical (anterior and posterior cusps) when the commissures were at 4 – 10, 5 – 11 or 3 – 9 o ’ clock, and atypical (right and left cusps) when the commissures were at 1 – 7 or 12 – 6 o ’ clock ( ﬁ gure 1A). The pres- ence of a raphe was recorded. Hence, four main types were identi ﬁ ed; typical with and without raphe and atypical with and without raphe. 3 16\nAortic valve function was evaluated using Doppler methods: aortic stenosis severity was assessed by the transaortic mean gradi- ent and the aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation. Aortic stenosis was de ﬁ ned as severe when the aortic valve area (AVA) was ≤ 1 cm² or mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, and as moderate when the AVA was 1 – 1.5 cm² and mean gradient 25 – 40 mm Hg. 10\nMeasurements of the aortic annulus were performed in early systole, parasternal long axis view zoomed on the left ventricular out ﬂ ow tract, inner edge to inner edge, at insertion points of the aortic cusps. Aortic regurgitation (AR) evaluation 21 was based on American Society of Echocardiography criteria, with classi ﬁ cation as ≤ mild, moderate, and &gt;moderate using colour Doppler jet width and extension, vena contracta width measurement and, when possible, quantitative measurements using the proximal iso- velocity surface area method. The aetiology of AR was classi ﬁ ed as: cusp prolapse, cusp degeneration (cusp thickening and restric- tion), predominant annular enlargement, or indeterminate.\nAll measurements of the aorta were performed by the same investigator (DD) according to recommendations and on the QRS complex of the ECG. 22 23 The dimensions of the Valsalva sinuses were measured perpendicular to the right and left (or non-) aortic sinuses. The sinotubular junction (STJ) was mea- sured where the aortic sinuses met the tubular aorta. The AA\nwas measured approximately 2 cm distal to the STJ. To verify the validity of the echocardiographic measurements of the aortic dimensions, random cases were re-measured by a second observer and the echocardiographic measurements compared to clinically indicated MRI measurements performed during the same episode of care in 42 patients.\nThree aortic phenotypes were de ﬁ ned for all groups: (1) normal shape: Valsalva sinuses &lt;37 mm and AA&lt;Valsalva; (2) predomin- ant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (Valsalva ≥ 37 mm and Valsalva&gt;AA); (3) predominant dilatation of the AA (AA ≥ 37 mm and AA&gt;Valsalva) ( ﬁ gure 1B). Measurements were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Yearly dilatation rates were calculated as: [diameter 2 – diameter 1]/time interval in years.\nExpected diameters of the sinuses of Valsalva and STJ at base- line and follow-up were calculated from Roman ’ s equations 23 using age and the body surface area (BSA) of the BAV popula- tion, allowing for the calculation of an expected dilatation rate. Patients were identi ﬁ ed as ‘ rapid progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was within the upper quartile for that aortic segment (annulus, Valsalva sinuses, STJ, and AA) and as ‘ non-progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was in the lower quartile.\n\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean±SD or percentage as appropriate. Baseline and follow-up values were compared using paired t test and the observed dilatation rate was compared to the expected dila- tation rate using Student t test. Comparisons between BAV, MFS, and DA used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non- parametric Wilcoxon test (in cases of signi ﬁ cance, two by two com- parisons were tested using Student t test and post-hoc Tukey ana- lysis). Among patients with BAV, the aortic patterns and subtypes of BAV were compared using ANOVA. To de ﬁ ne an independent asso- ciation, multivariate analyses were performed adjusting for signi ﬁ - cant univariable predictors. Univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of rapid progression. Rapid progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the upper quartile for each aortic segment) were thus de ﬁ ned as ≥ 0.2 mm/ year, ≥ 0.34 mm/year, ≥ 0.4 mm/year, ≥ 0.6 mm/year, for annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, STJ, and AA, respectively. Non-progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the lower quartile) were de ﬁ ned as ≤ 0 mm/ year for all levels. Candidate variables were age, gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis at baseline, AR at baseline, type of aortic dilatation, and type of BAV. Odd ratios of rapid progression were calculated. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nBaseline characteristics in BAV patients\nBaseline characteristics are summarised in the upper two thirds of table 1. We enrolled 353 adults with BAV (male 72%) with baseline and follow-up echocardiograms separated by 3.6 ±1.2 years (1271 patient-years). Mean age was 48±15 years and mean BSA 1.98±0.2 m². BAV was typical with raphe in 204 (58%), typical without raphe in 57 (16%), atypical without raphe in 56 (16%), and atypical with raphe in 29 (8%). In seven patients (2%), while certainty on BAV was con ﬁ rmed, the typing was uncertain ( ﬁ gure 2, panel A, grey slice). Inter-observer echo- cardiographic variability was non-signi ﬁ cant and in the 42 patients with MRI during the same episode of care, measure- ments were similar to echocardiography for Valsalva sinuses (36.7 vs 36.5 mm, p=0.62) and AA (35.6 vs 35.9 mm, p=0.70).\nAR was observed in 246 (70%) BAV patients and was mild in 123, moderate in 117, and severe in six cases at baseline. Mean\nvena contracta was 2.3±2.2 mm. AR was due to cusp prolapse in 37%, degenerative disease in 24%, predominant annular enlargement in 24%, and indeterminate in 15%. Signi ﬁ cant aortic stenosis was observed in 51 (14%) patients (moderate in 44, severe in seven).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies at baseline\nBy design, compared to BAV patients, the group of 51 DA patients and 50 MFS patients were similar for gender, systolic blood pressure (all p=NS), and minimum follow-up time. Also,\nBSA was similar between groups ( p=0.59) but, as expected, their ages differed, with the youngest patients in the MFS group and the oldest in the DA group ( p&lt;0.0001, table 1). AR ≥ moderate was more frequent in BAV patients versus DA and MFS patients ( p&lt;0.0001), despite similar annular dia- meters and smaller Valsalva sinuses in BAV (table 1).\n\n\nAortic phenotype and BAV morphology/function at baseline\nComparisons between aortic phenotype and BAV morphology/ function at baseline are presented in table 2.

Patients with non-dilated aorta (normal shape) were younger with a smaller BSA compared to other aortic patterns, and the four types of BAV were equally distributed ( ﬁ gure 2B). Patients with predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation were more frequently men and had predominantly a typical BAV ( ﬁ gure 2C). In multivariate analysis, independent determinants of Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype were younger age (p=0.0001),\nmale gender (p&lt;0.0001), higher BSA (p=0.002), and the typical morphology of BAV (p=0.0001). AR ≥ moderate was not an inde- pendent determinant of the Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype.\nAortic diameters according to BAV subtypes are summarised in table 3. Independent predictors of aortic diameters at baseline were older age, male gender,higher BSA for all levels of the aorta, and the presence of AR ≥ moderate only at the level of the annulus. On multivariate analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, BSA,\n\n\nTable 1 Baseline aortic diameters and yearly aortic dilatation rates in patients with BAV, DA, and MFS\n*Indicates significant differences between BAV and DA.\n† Indicates significant differences between BAV and MFS.\n‡ Indicates significant differences between MFS and DA.\n§Indicates significant differences between baseline and follow-up diameters.\nLarger baseline aortic diameters in DA patients reflect the inclusion criteria of 40 mm for these patients versus 37 mm for BAV and MFS.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve; BP, blood pressure; DA, degenerative aortopathy; MFS, Marfan syndrome.\nFigure 2 Distribution of the type of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).

However, BAV had smaller Valsalva sinuses versus MFS and DA, and the AA was largest in DA versus BAV and\nMFS. Thus, the phenotype of aortic dilatation was different, involv- ing all segments in DA, involving preferentially Valsalva sinuses in MFS, and preferentially the AA in BAV. However, despite the prefer- ential AA dilatation in BAV (60% of BAV patients at baseline), 27% had predominant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (table 2).\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV patients\nBAV aortic dilatation rates per year, level and group are indicated in the lower third of table 1. During follow-up, aortic diameters\n\n\nTable 3 Baseline characteristics and yearly aortic dilatation rate according to BAV subtype\n*Significant difference between typical and atypical, regardless of raphe.\n† Significant difference between typical and atypical with raphe.\n‡ Significant difference between typical with raphe and other subgroups.\nAR, aortic regurgitation; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristics of BAV patients according to aortic phenotype\n*NS between Valsalva&gt;AA and AA&gt;Valsalva.\n‡ Significant for predominance of typical type in Valsalva&gt;AA phenotype.\nAA, ascending aorta; AS, aortic stenosis; BAV, bicuspid aortic valve.\nsigni ﬁ cantly increased at all levels in patients with BAV (all p&lt;0.001, table 1) and yearly aortic dilatation rate increased from the aortic annulus to the AA (from 0.05±0.2 mm/year to 0.42±0.6 mm/year, respectively). The maximum dilation rate was 0.42±0.6 mm/year (median 0.3 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0 – 0.64) at the AA level. These dilatation rates were greater than expected yearly dilatation rates derived from Roman ’ s nomo- grams (0.08±0.3 mm/year for Valsalva sinuses ( p&lt;0.0001), and 0.07±0.2 mm/year for STJ ( p=0.005)). During follow-up, pre- scribed treatment was ACE inhibitors in 25% of cases, angioten- sin receptor blockers in 7%, and β -blockers in 32%. There was no independent association of the treatment with lower aortic dilatation progression rate (all p&gt;0.13).\nAnalysing determinants of aortic dilatation rate in BAV, the range (CI 10% to 90%) of dilatation rate was wide and increased from the annulus (0.3 mm) to Valsalva sinuses (0.6 mm), to the AA (1.0 mm). Baseline characteristics asso- ciated with greater maximum BAV aortic dilatation rate (any aortic level) were younger age and smaller aortic diameter at baseline; there was no association between aortic dilatation rate and gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis/ regurgitation at baseline, pattern of aortic dilatation, or type of BAV. The aortic dilatation rate in subgroups of BAV was unre- lated to morphology or the presence of raphe (table 3). We also evaluated predictors of progression for each segment. At the level of the annulus, no baseline parameter was associated with rapid progression. For Valsalva sinuses, rapid progression was associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.97 95% CI (0.96 to 0.99), p=0.007) and with the degree of AR at diagnosis (OR per mm of vena contracta: 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.3), p=0.03). For STJ, rapid progression was associated with smaller STJ dia- meters at baseline (OR per mm: 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.99), p=0.02) and tended to be associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.98 (0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). For AA, rapid progression was associated with lower AA diameter at baseline (OR per mm: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98), p=0.008) and tended to be asso- ciated with younger age (OR per year and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). Forcing the type of BAV into the model did not affect the results or show a morphology – dilatation rate link. Importantly, non-progressors could not be identi ﬁ ed from base- line aortic diameter, measured at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva ( p=0.34) or STJ ( p=0.23). Above the STJ, non- progressors had greater baseline aortic diameter ( p=0.03).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nContrasting aortic dilatation progression in BAV versus MFS versus DA, dilatation rates did not differ at the annulus level ( p=0.51) and the STJ level ( p=0.57). In contrast, the largest aortic dilatation rate was observed in MFS at the level of the Valsalva sinuses (0.49±0.5 mm/year (median 0.42 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0.13 – 0.8)) and in BAV at the AA level (both p&lt;0.03, table 1). Although occurring at different levels, these maximum aortic dilatation rates in MFS and BAV did not differ in mean magnitude and were greater than the maximum aortic dilatation rate in DA at any level ( p=0.02). However, despite similar mean progression of magnitude, the distribution of maximal aortic dilatation rate differed between patients with BAV and MFS ( ﬁ gure 3) and a larger percentage of patients with BAV (43% vs 20%, p=0.01) did not incur aortic dilatation during follow-up. At last follow-up, comparing aortic dimen- sions in BAV, MFS and DA, the aortic annulus was similar in all groups ( p=0.40) and the Valsalva sinuses (38±6, 44±6 and 41.8±6 mm) were different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), being largest in MFS and smallest in BAV. The STJ (32±5, 35\n±7, and 37.5±6 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in BAV. The AA (39±6, 34±7, and 45±4 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in MFS. Thus, the phenotype of Valsalva sinuses&gt;AA was present in 96% of MFS cases vs 30% of DA and 36% of BAV ( p&lt;0.0001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this collaborative tertiary referral US – European registry is the largest echocardiographic study evaluat- ing valvulo-aortic phenotypes, rates, and patterns of aortic dila- tation and their determinants in BAV patients. In addition, we compared for the ﬁ rst time progression in BAV to that of other aortopathies (MFS and DA) in patients of similar gender, sys- tolic blood pressure, and minimum interval to follow-up. The most important ﬁ nding of this study is that in patients with BAV, the fastest aortic dilatation rate is observed at the AA level (0.42 mm/year), is independent of BAV morphology, and is similar to the aortic dilatation rate observed in MFS patients at the level of the Valsalva sinuses. Secondly, the AA dilatation rate is heterogeneous in BAV patients, with signi ﬁ cantly more patients characterised as ‘ non-progressors ’ compared to MFS. These different phenotypic characteristics and different progres- sion patterns could be partially linked to the relatively low risk of aortic catastrophes in patients with BAV. 5 Thirdly, in patients with BAV, a normal aortic diameter at baseline does not predict a lower rate of dilatation (and vice versa), and determinants of rapid progression are lower age and smaller baseline aortic diameter, such that systematic aortic size follow-up is warranted in all patients with BAV, regardless of baseline measurement. This also has important research implications — trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dilatation rates would be most powerful when applied to younger patients with smaller base- line aortas. Fourthly, all BAV types can exhibit a non-dilated aorta but the most common site of dilation for all BAV types is the AA. Nevertheless, we corroborate the presence of a group of BAV patients with predominant dilatation of Valsalva sinuses, 16 24 characterised by a preponderance of typical BAV morphology and male gender. We expand knowledge within this notion by observing that a typical BAV independently pre- dicts baseline dilatation of the entire proximal aorta (annulus, sinuses, STJ), except AA. Finally, for the time interval studied, we show that BAV morphology is not associated with aortic dila- tation progression rates.\n\n\nBAV and the aorta\nIn patients with BAV, we observed three basic aortic phenotypes at baseline: (1) a normal shape, which was more common in younger patients; (2) a predominance of Valsalva sinus dilatation, which was observed mostly in males with typical BAV; (3) a predomin- ance of AA dilatation, which was independent of BAV morphology and was the most common pattern of aortic dilatation. Our large study reconciles the discordances between previously described predominant patterns of aortic dilatation in BAV, 6 7 13 – 16 and by showing not just a predominance of AA dilatation but different valvulo-aortic phenotypes, supports a genetically heterogeneous origin for BAV with dissimilar embryology. 25 The predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation in BAV or ‘ sinuses phenotype ’ was ﬁ rst described by Della Corte et al , 26 and the variable prevalence between their study and ours likely relates to different inclusion de ﬁ nitions.\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV\nIn BAV patients, the aortic dilatation rate was maximal at the AA level — 0.42 mm/year (two times greater than at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva) — and could not be predicted by the BAV type. In addition, the presence of aortic dilatation at baseline was not a risk factor for rapid aortic dilatation at any aortic level and younger patients tended to dilate more rapidly than older patients. These ﬁ ndings may seem to contradict previous reports in which older age and baseline aortic dilatation were predictors of aneurysm formation. 3 5 The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the current study evaluated intermediate term dilatation rates (within 3.6±1.2 years) while prior studies evaluated long term end points (ie, aneurysm formation) and not dilatation rates. Indeed, most patients with a dilated aorta at baseline were also older in the current study.\nRegarding factors associated with aortic dilatation rates, both typical BAV 15 and atypical BAV 27 have been suggested as predic- tors of faster aortic dilatation. Our large study is adequately powered to address this issue and could not detect a link between the BAV type and the rate of aortic dilatation. Furthermore, within each type of BAV, the aortic dilatation rate displayed a wide range, supporting the fact that risk strati ﬁ cation for aortic dilatation rate based on BAV morphology would be inadequate. We found no association between BAV dysfunction and aortic dilatation progression rates (except AR and Valsalva sinuses). Aortic stenosis has been linked to aneurysm forma- tion, 5 28 as a long term outcome. It is possible that aortic sten- osis is a marker of increased age, which in turn is related to development of aneurysms. In addition, there was a paucity (14%) of signi ﬁ cant stenosis in our BAV group. Although this paucity of stenosis favours the ‘ histological aortic weakness ’ concept in our study, there is clear evidence that non-stenotic BAVs are nonetheless intrinsically dysfunctional, generating sig- ni ﬁ cant ﬂ ow abnormalities that increase systolic shear stress in the aorta. 29 We hypothesise that both haemodynamic and histo- logical aspects are important. Moreover, it is likely that other yet unknown genetic and environmental factors are at play. Mean aortic dilatation rates were considerable in earlier reports,\nwith values ranging from 0.8 – 1.2 mm/year, 11 13 14 whereas we found a rate of 0.42 mm/year in our report, which is very similar to the 0.37 mm/year in the recent report from Thanassoulis et al. 15 Our interpretation of this difference is that improved measurement accuracy with enhanced imaging and more widespread use of systematic follow-up imaging by echo- cardiography yield more realistic progression rates in the recent era.\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nThe mean aortic dilatation rate in BAV patients was greater com- pared to that observed in DA patients, and similar to that observed in patients with MFS carrying an FBN1 mutation. Indeed, BAV and MFS aortas display similar histological features, so that it may be impossible to recognise the aetiology of aneur- ysms of the aorta based on histology alone. However, several differences between MFS and BAV can be emphasised. The maximal aortic dilatation rate is observed above the STJ in the population with BAV, whereas it is observed at the level of the Valsalva sinuses in the MFS population, suggesting different ana- tomic sites of aortic vulnerability. In addition, although mean aortic dilatation rates are similar in MFS and BAV, almost half of the BAV patients are non-progressors, whereas the majority of patients with MFS progress over time. In our study, AR was more frequent with BAV than with MFS or DA, despite larger sinuses of Valsalva in these latter aortopathies. Thus, AR in BAV is possibly a consequence of the abnormal valve rather than proximal aortic dilatation. Nevertheless, AR was associated with dilatation progression at the Valsalva sinuses level.\n\n\nStudy limitations and strengths\nThe design of our study is retrospective – observational and may be prone to bias. However, the large size of our study and pro- spective aortic measurement undertaken by an experienced observer (DD), with blinding of the aortic measurement to any clinical or outcome data, suggest the likelihood of bias is low. Furthermore, matching of groups (BAV, MFS, DA) in regard to factors that may affect aortic dilatation over time also minimises\nFigure 3 Comparative distribution of the aortic dilatation rate in the segment of the aorta more prone to dilatation. Tubular ascending aorta for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and sinuses of Valsalva in patients with Marfan syndrome.\nAlthough the mean value is similar\n(0.42 and 0.49 mm/year respectively),\nthe distribution of the population is very different.\nthe possibility of inter-group bias. However, baseline aortic diameter inclusion (larger for DA) and age difference (older for DA) could partially explain the maximum aortic dilatation rates in DA patients being smaller than in MFS and BAV. Also, we used actual blood pressure measurement and not ‘ history of hypertension ’ in our de ﬁ nitions, and the DA group likely has a higher prevalence of hypertension.\nObviously, we could not correct for age as different aortopa- thies are clinically recognised at variable ages of the patients. Age is likely a determinant of dilatation progression and thus limits the quantitative comparison between groups. Importantly, when matching patients with BAV and MFS for ages between 30 – 50 years (BAV 41.5±6, MFS 40.2±6; p=0.27), we observed no difference in maximal progression rate ( p=0.5) and corrobo- rated faster progression of sinuses for MFS and tubular ascend- ing for BAV ( p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the age groups are representative of current clinical practice for each aortopathy, therefore their quantitative comparison seems fair from the clin- ical perspective. Aortic measurements were performed by echo- cardiography which was consistently performed at baseline and follow-up, whereas CT or MRI imaging in accordance with current recommendations 30 was not consistently performed. Nevertheless, echocardiographic measurements remain the current standard of care 30 and in patients with concomitant MRI there was no detectable difference between techniques. Notwithstanding, analysis of aortic arch dimensions was not possible in this study. The results of this study are applicable only to adults ( ≥ 18 years) within a tertiary referral based prac- tice, and are not meant to represent the entire spectrum of MFS and DA, as these were matched by gender to patients with BAV. The conclusions of our study represent the observations made over a 25 – 75 centile interval time of 2.7 – 4.5 years and longer follow-up studies should be performed. Finally, the use of annualised aortic dilatation rates and lack of an intermediate measurement between the ﬁ rst and follow-up echocardiograms limit the analysis of more complex aortic growth attributes such as potential time dependent growth decelerations.\n\n\nClinical/research implications\nIn BAV patients, baseline AA dilatation is most common and independent of valve morphology, while baseline sinus of Valsalva dilatation is associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. The aortic dilatation rate is maximal at the AA, independent of valve function and morphology, and similar but not greater than that observed at the sinuses of Valsalva in patients with MFS. Thus, dilatation above the STJ should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The observed dilatation rates cannot be inferred from BAV morphology or baseline aortic diameter measured once, and therefore systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Furthermore, because the aortic dilatation rate may signi ﬁ cantly differ between individual patients, only speci ﬁ c follow-up measurements can determine individual size-dependent aortic risk. In addition, although there is an independent association between typical BAV and the predominant Valsalva sinus phenotype, the risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Aortic dilatation rates at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva are signi ﬁ cantly less prominent than AA, supporting a recent report 31 which indicates that preserving the Valsalva sinuses at the time of AA replacement in patients with BAV and no signi ﬁ - cant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses, was not associated with reintervention due to progressive dilatation of Valsalva sinuses at follow-up. Trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dila- tation rates would be most revealing when applied to younger\npatients with smaller baseline aortas. Lastly, the dilatation rate heterogeneity and its independence from BAV morphology suggest a higher level of complexity in genetic and environmen- tal determinants of BAV aortopathy, which need to be determined.\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\nWhat is already known about this subject\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with aortic dilatation. Patterns of dilatation are not well de ﬁ ned and comparison with other aortopathies is lacking.\n\n\nWhat does this study add\nIn BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Sinuses growth rate is slower. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict the progression rate. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV and Marfan syndrome, but a signi ﬁ cantly higher BAV patient proportion does not progress at all.\n\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice\nDilatation above the sinotubular junction should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Surgical preservation of a normal aortic sinuses appears theoretically reasonable. Aortic dilatation patterns are different between BAV and Marfan syndrome patients.\nContributors All authors contributed to: conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and ﬁ nal approval of the version published.\nFunding PHRC AOM09093 (GJ), ANR 2010 BLAN 1129 from the French National Research Agency (GJ).\nCompeting interests None.\nEthics approval Institutional Review Boards of participating centres.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\n\n\nEditor ’ s choice Scan to access more free content 126 Detaint D, et al .

We sought to de ﬁ ne ascending aorta dilatation patterns/ progression rates in BAV versus other aortopathies (Marfan syndrome (MFS), degenerative aortopathy (DA)). Design and setting Retrospective, observational study. Aortic dilatation progression was evaluated in two tertiary care centres (US and European) by repeated echocardiography ≥ 2 years apart in adults with BAV (n=353), matched to MFS (n=50) and DA (n=51) for gender, blood pressure, and minimum follow-up time. Results At baseline, ascending aortic dilatation was present in 87% of BAV cases: tubular ascending aorta in 60% (irrespective of BAV morphology), and Valsalva sinuses dilatation in 27% (independently linked to typical BAV morphology and male gender ( p=0.0001)). After 3.6±1.2 years, the aortic dilatation rate in BAV was higher than expected for the population for all aortic levels ( p=0.005) and was maximal at the tubular ascending aorta for BAV (0.42±0.6 mm/year) and DA (0.20±0.3 mm/year), and was maximal at the Valsalva sinuses for MFS (0.49±0.5 mm/year). Maximal aortic dilatation rate was similar between BAV and MFS ( p&gt;0.40) and lower in DA ( p=0.02) but was heterogeneous in BAV, with 43% of BAV not progressing (vs 20% of MFS, p=0.01). Aortic dilatation rate was not proportionally related to baseline aortic size or BAV type (all models p&gt;0.40).\nConclusions In patients with BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses is less common and associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV (tubular segment) and MFS (Valsalva sinuses), but a signi ﬁ cantly higher proportion of BAV patients does not progress at all, irrespective of BAV type. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict progression rate; systematic follow-up is therefore warranted in patients with BAV.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital abnormality with a prevalence of 1.3%. 1 BAV is associated with endocarditis 2 and premature aortic valve dysfunction. 3 4 However, BAV is not just a valvular disorder but also an aortopathy, with aortic dilatation and risk of aortic dissection and\nrupture. 5 Valvular dysfunction may play a role in the development of aortic abnormalities, but aortic dilatation is often out of proportion to the degree of valvular dysfunction, 6 7 suggesting an intrinsic aortic tissue abnormality. Indeed, BAV studies have reported structural abnormalities of thoracic aortic tissue, including decreased ﬁ brillin, elastin fragmen- tation, matrix disruption, and apoptosis. 8 9 These similarities to Marfan syndrome (MFS) led the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association to recommend aggressive elective aortic surgery for BAV patients with aortic dilatation or sooner as possible for ‘ rapid progressors ’ . 10\nHowever, there are considerable uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that in BAV patients the risk of aortic catastrophes, although higher than in the general population, remains low. 4 5 Additionally, reports of aortic dilatation progression involved limited sample sizes and paediatric populations, 11 12 and resulted in discordant progression rates 13 – 15 with variable association with BAV function and morphology. Additionally, patterns of aortic dilata- tion with BAV were variably reported as predomin- antly involving the tubular ascending aorta (AA), 16 the Valsalva sinuses and proximal AA, 6 or as balanced, 7 and were not compared to those of MFS. The controversies regarding aortic imaging similarities and differences between various types of aortopathies (BAV, MFS, and degenerative aorto- pathy (DA)) in regard to progression rates and pat- terns of aortic dilatation are unresolved. 17 To address these controversies, we studied a large population of patients with BAV who were fol- lowed for at least 2 years at two large European and US centres, analysed aortic dilatation patterns, rates and their determinants, and as a secondary aim, compared BAV to other aortopathies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards for each institution. We identi ﬁ ed patients in two tertiary referral centres (Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and Bichat Hospital, Paris, France) with the conditions listed below, who had echocardiograms between 2003 and 2008 and the latest follow-up echocardiogram performed at least 2 years later. Three different patients groups were assembled:\nBAV patients : Adults (age ≥ 18 years) with BAV identi ﬁ ed by echocardiography were included. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery\n(except for aortic coarctation repair) or aortic dissection or the diagnoses of MFS or other severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction.\nDA patients : Adults were included if they had a tricuspid aortic valve with dilatation of the sinuses or AA (diameter &gt;40 mm) determined by echocardiogram. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, MFS, or severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 51 patients were matched to BAV patients for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\nMFS patients : Adults were included from the French Marfan and Associated Disease Centre, provided they ful ﬁ lled inter- national criteria 18 including a mutation in the FBN1 gene and had a tricuspid aortic valve at echocardiography. Exclusion cri- teria were previous cardiac surgery, aortic dissection, and severe congenital heart defect. No exclusions were made on the basis of associated valvular dysfunction. A total of 50 patients were matched to patients with BAV for gender, systolic blood pressure at baseline, and timing of minimum follow-up echocardiography.\n\n\nEchocardiography\nAll patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardi- ography evaluation at baseline and at follow-up. All echocardio- grams were prospectively reviewed blindly of diagnosis by an experienced observer (DD) to ensure homogeneity in the aorta measurements in both centres. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by 2D echocardiography 19 including visual estima- tion. 20 Diagnosis of BAV was based on parasternal short axis imaging of the aortic valve using either transthoracic echocardi- ography or transoesophageal echocardiography at 45°, requiring the presence of only two commissures delimiting only two aortic cusps. Bicuspid valves were classi ﬁ ed as typical (anterior and posterior cusps) when the commissures were at 4 – 10, 5 – 11 or 3 – 9 o ’ clock, and atypical (right and left cusps) when the commissures were at 1 – 7 or 12 – 6 o ’ clock ( ﬁ gure 1A). The pres- ence of a raphe was recorded. Hence, four main types were identi ﬁ ed; typical with and without raphe and atypical with and without raphe. 3 16\nAortic valve function was evaluated using Doppler methods: aortic stenosis severity was assessed by the transaortic mean gradi- ent and the aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation. Aortic stenosis was de ﬁ ned as severe when the aortic valve area (AVA) was ≤ 1 cm² or mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, and as moderate when the AVA was 1 – 1.5 cm² and mean gradient 25 – 40 mm Hg. 10\nMeasurements of the aortic annulus were performed in early systole, parasternal long axis view zoomed on the left ventricular out ﬂ ow tract, inner edge to inner edge, at insertion points of the aortic cusps. Aortic regurgitation (AR) evaluation 21 was based on American Society of Echocardiography criteria, with classi ﬁ cation as ≤ mild, moderate, and &gt;moderate using colour Doppler jet width and extension, vena contracta width measurement and, when possible, quantitative measurements using the proximal iso- velocity surface area method. The aetiology of AR was classi ﬁ ed as: cusp prolapse, cusp degeneration (cusp thickening and restric- tion), predominant annular enlargement, or indeterminate.\nAll measurements of the aorta were performed by the same investigator (DD) according to recommendations and on the QRS complex of the ECG. 22 23 The dimensions of the Valsalva sinuses were measured perpendicular to the right and left (or non-) aortic sinuses. The sinotubular junction (STJ) was mea- sured where the aortic sinuses met the tubular aorta. The AA\nwas measured approximately 2 cm distal to the STJ. To verify the validity of the echocardiographic measurements of the aortic dimensions, random cases were re-measured by a second observer and the echocardiographic measurements compared to clinically indicated MRI measurements performed during the same episode of care in 42 patients.\nThree aortic phenotypes were de ﬁ ned for all groups: (1) normal shape: Valsalva sinuses &lt;37 mm and AA&lt;Valsalva; (2) predomin- ant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (Valsalva ≥ 37 mm and Valsalva&gt;AA); (3) predominant dilatation of the AA (AA ≥ 37 mm and AA&gt;Valsalva) ( ﬁ gure 1B). Measurements were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Yearly dilatation rates were calculated as: [diameter 2 – diameter 1]/time interval in years.\nExpected diameters of the sinuses of Valsalva and STJ at base- line and follow-up were calculated from Roman ’ s equations 23 using age and the body surface area (BSA) of the BAV popula- tion, allowing for the calculation of an expected dilatation rate. Patients were identi ﬁ ed as ‘ rapid progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was within the upper quartile for that aortic segment (annulus, Valsalva sinuses, STJ, and AA) and as ‘ non-progressors ’ if the dilatation rate of one aortic segment was in the lower quartile.\n\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean±SD or percentage as appropriate. Baseline and follow-up values were compared using paired t test and the observed dilatation rate was compared to the expected dila- tation rate using Student t test. Comparisons between BAV, MFS, and DA used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non- parametric Wilcoxon test (in cases of signi ﬁ cance, two by two com- parisons were tested using Student t test and post-hoc Tukey ana- lysis). Among patients with BAV, the aortic patterns and subtypes of BAV were compared using ANOVA. To de ﬁ ne an independent asso- ciation, multivariate analyses were performed adjusting for signi ﬁ - cant univariable predictors. Univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of rapid progression. Rapid progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the upper quartile for each aortic segment) were thus de ﬁ ned as ≥ 0.2 mm/ year, ≥ 0.34 mm/year, ≥ 0.4 mm/year, ≥ 0.6 mm/year, for annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, STJ, and AA, respectively. Non-progressors (ie, dilatation rate within the lower quartile) were de ﬁ ned as ≤ 0 mm/ year for all levels. Candidate variables were age, gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis at baseline, AR at baseline, type of aortic dilatation, and type of BAV. Odd ratios of rapid progression were calculated. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nBaseline characteristics in BAV patients\nBaseline characteristics are summarised in the upper two thirds of table 1. We enrolled 353 adults with BAV (male 72%) with baseline and follow-up echocardiograms separated by 3.6 ±1.2 years (1271 patient-years). Mean age was 48±15 years and mean BSA 1.98±0.2 m². BAV was typical with raphe in 204 (58%), typical without raphe in 57 (16%), atypical without raphe in 56 (16%), and atypical with raphe in 29 (8%). In seven patients (2%), while certainty on BAV was con ﬁ rmed, the typing was uncertain ( ﬁ gure 2, panel A, grey slice). Inter-observer echo- cardiographic variability was non-signi ﬁ cant and in the 42 patients with MRI during the same episode of care, measure- ments were similar to echocardiography for Valsalva sinuses (36.7 vs 36.5 mm, p=0.62) and AA (35.6 vs 35.9 mm, p=0.70).\nAR was observed in 246 (70%) BAV patients and was mild in 123, moderate in 117, and severe in six cases at baseline. Mean\nvena contracta was 2.3±2.2 mm. AR was due to cusp prolapse in 37%, degenerative disease in 24%, predominant annular enlargement in 24%, and indeterminate in 15%. Signi ﬁ cant aortic stenosis was observed in 51 (14%) patients (moderate in 44, severe in seven).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies at baseline\nBy design, compared to BAV patients, the group of 51 DA patients and 50 MFS patients were similar for gender, systolic blood pressure (all p=NS), and minimum follow-up time. Also,\nBSA was similar between groups ( p=0.59) but, as expected, their ages differed, with the youngest patients in the MFS group and the oldest in the DA group ( p&lt;0.0001, table 1). AR ≥ moderate was more frequent in BAV patients versus DA and MFS patients ( p&lt;0.0001), despite similar annular dia- meters and smaller Valsalva sinuses in BAV (table 1).\n\n\nAortic phenotype and BAV morphology/function at baseline\nComparisons between aortic phenotype and BAV morphology/ function at baseline are presented in table 2.

Patients with non-dilated aorta (normal shape) were younger with a smaller BSA compared to other aortic patterns, and the four types of BAV were equally distributed ( ﬁ gure 2B). Patients with predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation were more frequently men and had predominantly a typical BAV ( ﬁ gure 2C). In multivariate analysis, independent determinants of Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype were younger age (p=0.0001),\nmale gender (p&lt;0.0001), higher BSA (p=0.002), and the typical morphology of BAV (p=0.0001). AR ≥ moderate was not an inde- pendent determinant of the Valsalva&gt;AA aortic phenotype.\nAortic diameters according to BAV subtypes are summarised in table 3.

However, BAV had smaller Valsalva sinuses versus MFS and DA, and the AA was largest in DA versus BAV and\nMFS. Thus, the phenotype of aortic dilatation was different, involv- ing all segments in DA, involving preferentially Valsalva sinuses in MFS, and preferentially the AA in BAV. However, despite the prefer- ential AA dilatation in BAV (60% of BAV patients at baseline), 27% had predominant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses (table 2).\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV patients\nBAV aortic dilatation rates per year, level and group are indicated in the lower third of table 1.

The maximum dilation rate was 0.42±0.6 mm/year (median 0.3 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0 – 0.64) at the AA level. These dilatation rates were greater than expected yearly dilatation rates derived from Roman ’ s nomo- grams (0.08±0.3 mm/year for Valsalva sinuses ( p&lt;0.0001), and 0.07±0.2 mm/year for STJ ( p=0.005)). During follow-up, pre- scribed treatment was ACE inhibitors in 25% of cases, angioten- sin receptor blockers in 7%, and β -blockers in 32%. There was no independent association of the treatment with lower aortic dilatation progression rate (all p&gt;0.13).\nAnalysing determinants of aortic dilatation rate in BAV, the range (CI 10% to 90%) of dilatation rate was wide and increased from the annulus (0.3 mm) to Valsalva sinuses (0.6 mm), to the AA (1.0 mm). Baseline characteristics asso- ciated with greater maximum BAV aortic dilatation rate (any aortic level) were younger age and smaller aortic diameter at baseline; there was no association between aortic dilatation rate and gender, BSA, blood pressure, heart rate, aortic stenosis/ regurgitation at baseline, pattern of aortic dilatation, or type of BAV. The aortic dilatation rate in subgroups of BAV was unre- lated to morphology or the presence of raphe (table 3). We also evaluated predictors of progression for each segment. At the level of the annulus, no baseline parameter was associated with rapid progression. For Valsalva sinuses, rapid progression was associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.97 95% CI (0.96 to 0.99), p=0.007) and with the degree of AR at diagnosis (OR per mm of vena contracta: 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.3), p=0.03). For STJ, rapid progression was associated with smaller STJ dia- meters at baseline (OR per mm: 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.99), p=0.02) and tended to be associated with younger age (OR per year: 0.98 (0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). For AA, rapid progression was associated with lower AA diameter at baseline (OR per mm: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98), p=0.008) and tended to be asso- ciated with younger age (OR per year and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00), p=0.05). Forcing the type of BAV into the model did not affect the results or show a morphology – dilatation rate link. Importantly, non-progressors could not be identi ﬁ ed from base- line aortic diameter, measured at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva ( p=0.34) or STJ ( p=0.23). Above the STJ, non- progressors had greater baseline aortic diameter ( p=0.03).\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nContrasting aortic dilatation progression in BAV versus MFS versus DA, dilatation rates did not differ at the annulus level ( p=0.51) and the STJ level ( p=0.57). In contrast, the largest aortic dilatation rate was observed in MFS at the level of the Valsalva sinuses (0.49±0.5 mm/year (median 0.42 mm/year, 25 – 75th centile 0.13 – 0.8)) and in BAV at the AA level (both p&lt;0.03, table 1). Although occurring at different levels, these maximum aortic dilatation rates in MFS and BAV did not differ in mean magnitude and were greater than the maximum aortic dilatation rate in DA at any level ( p=0.02). However, despite similar mean progression of magnitude, the distribution of maximal aortic dilatation rate differed between patients with BAV and MFS ( ﬁ gure 3) and a larger percentage of patients with BAV (43% vs 20%, p=0.01) did not incur aortic dilatation during follow-up. At last follow-up, comparing aortic dimen- sions in BAV, MFS and DA, the aortic annulus was similar in all groups ( p=0.40) and the Valsalva sinuses (38±6, 44±6 and 41.8±6 mm) were different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), being largest in MFS and smallest in BAV. The STJ (32±5, 35\n±7, and 37.5±6 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in BAV. The AA (39±6, 34±7, and 45±4 mm) was also different between all groups (all p&lt;0.05), but largest in DA and smallest in MFS. Thus, the phenotype of Valsalva sinuses&gt;AA was present in 96% of MFS cases vs 30% of DA and 36% of BAV ( p&lt;0.0001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this collaborative tertiary referral US – European registry is the largest echocardiographic study evaluat- ing valvulo-aortic phenotypes, rates, and patterns of aortic dila- tation and their determinants in BAV patients. In addition, we compared for the ﬁ rst time progression in BAV to that of other aortopathies (MFS and DA) in patients of similar gender, sys- tolic blood pressure, and minimum interval to follow-up. The most important ﬁ nding of this study is that in patients with BAV, the fastest aortic dilatation rate is observed at the AA level (0.42 mm/year), is independent of BAV morphology, and is similar to the aortic dilatation rate observed in MFS patients at the level of the Valsalva sinuses. Secondly, the AA dilatation rate is heterogeneous in BAV patients, with signi ﬁ cantly more patients characterised as ‘ non-progressors ’ compared to MFS. These different phenotypic characteristics and different progres- sion patterns could be partially linked to the relatively low risk of aortic catastrophes in patients with BAV. 5 Thirdly, in patients with BAV, a normal aortic diameter at baseline does not predict a lower rate of dilatation (and vice versa), and determinants of rapid progression are lower age and smaller baseline aortic diameter, such that systematic aortic size follow-up is warranted in all patients with BAV, regardless of baseline measurement. This also has important research implications — trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dilatation rates would be most powerful when applied to younger patients with smaller base- line aortas. Fourthly, all BAV types can exhibit a non-dilated aorta but the most common site of dilation for all BAV types is the AA. Nevertheless, we corroborate the presence of a group of BAV patients with predominant dilatation of Valsalva sinuses, 16 24 characterised by a preponderance of typical BAV morphology and male gender. We expand knowledge within this notion by observing that a typical BAV independently pre- dicts baseline dilatation of the entire proximal aorta (annulus, sinuses, STJ), except AA. Finally, for the time interval studied, we show that BAV morphology is not associated with aortic dila- tation progression rates.\n\n\nBAV and the aorta\nIn patients with BAV, we observed three basic aortic phenotypes at baseline: (1) a normal shape, which was more common in younger patients; (2) a predominance of Valsalva sinus dilatation, which was observed mostly in males with typical BAV; (3) a predomin- ance of AA dilatation, which was independent of BAV morphology and was the most common pattern of aortic dilatation. Our large study reconciles the discordances between previously described predominant patterns of aortic dilatation in BAV, 6 7 13 – 16 and by showing not just a predominance of AA dilatation but different valvulo-aortic phenotypes, supports a genetically heterogeneous origin for BAV with dissimilar embryology. 25 The predominant Valsalva sinus dilatation in BAV or ‘ sinuses phenotype ’ was ﬁ rst described by Della Corte et al , 26 and the variable prevalence between their study and ours likely relates to different inclusion de ﬁ nitions.\n\n\nAortic dilatation rates in BAV\nIn BAV patients, the aortic dilatation rate was maximal at the AA level — 0.42 mm/year (two times greater than at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva) — and could not be predicted by the BAV type. In addition, the presence of aortic dilatation at baseline was not a risk factor for rapid aortic dilatation at any aortic level and younger patients tended to dilate more rapidly than older patients. These ﬁ ndings may seem to contradict previous reports in which older age and baseline aortic dilatation were predictors of aneurysm formation. 3 5 The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the current study evaluated intermediate term dilatation rates (within 3.6±1.2 years) while prior studies evaluated long term end points (ie, aneurysm formation) and not dilatation rates. Indeed, most patients with a dilated aorta at baseline were also older in the current study.\nRegarding factors associated with aortic dilatation rates, both typical BAV 15 and atypical BAV 27 have been suggested as predic- tors of faster aortic dilatation. Our large study is adequately powered to address this issue and could not detect a link between the BAV type and the rate of aortic dilatation. Furthermore, within each type of BAV, the aortic dilatation rate displayed a wide range, supporting the fact that risk strati ﬁ cation for aortic dilatation rate based on BAV morphology would be inadequate. We found no association between BAV dysfunction and aortic dilatation progression rates (except AR and Valsalva sinuses). Aortic stenosis has been linked to aneurysm forma- tion, 5 28 as a long term outcome. It is possible that aortic sten- osis is a marker of increased age, which in turn is related to development of aneurysms. In addition, there was a paucity (14%) of signi ﬁ cant stenosis in our BAV group. Although this paucity of stenosis favours the ‘ histological aortic weakness ’ concept in our study, there is clear evidence that non-stenotic BAVs are nonetheless intrinsically dysfunctional, generating sig- ni ﬁ cant ﬂ ow abnormalities that increase systolic shear stress in the aorta. 29 We hypothesise that both haemodynamic and histo- logical aspects are important. Moreover, it is likely that other yet unknown genetic and environmental factors are at play. Mean aortic dilatation rates were considerable in earlier reports,\nwith values ranging from 0.8 – 1.2 mm/year, 11 13 14 whereas we found a rate of 0.42 mm/year in our report, which is very similar to the 0.37 mm/year in the recent report from Thanassoulis et al. 15 Our interpretation of this difference is that improved measurement accuracy with enhanced imaging and more widespread use of systematic follow-up imaging by echo- cardiography yield more realistic progression rates in the recent era.\n\n\nComparison with other aortopathies\nThe mean aortic dilatation rate in BAV patients was greater com- pared to that observed in DA patients, and similar to that observed in patients with MFS carrying an FBN1 mutation. Indeed, BAV and MFS aortas display similar histological features, so that it may be impossible to recognise the aetiology of aneur- ysms of the aorta based on histology alone. However, several differences between MFS and BAV can be emphasised. The maximal aortic dilatation rate is observed above the STJ in the population with BAV, whereas it is observed at the level of the Valsalva sinuses in the MFS population, suggesting different ana- tomic sites of aortic vulnerability. In addition, although mean aortic dilatation rates are similar in MFS and BAV, almost half of the BAV patients are non-progressors, whereas the majority of patients with MFS progress over time. In our study, AR was more frequent with BAV than with MFS or DA, despite larger sinuses of Valsalva in these latter aortopathies. Thus, AR in BAV is possibly a consequence of the abnormal valve rather than proximal aortic dilatation. Nevertheless, AR was associated with dilatation progression at the Valsalva sinuses level.\n\n\nStudy limitations and strengths\nThe design of our study is retrospective – observational and may be prone to bias. However, the large size of our study and pro- spective aortic measurement undertaken by an experienced observer (DD), with blinding of the aortic measurement to any clinical or outcome data, suggest the likelihood of bias is low. Furthermore, matching of groups (BAV, MFS, DA) in regard to factors that may affect aortic dilatation over time also minimises\nFigure 3 Comparative distribution of the aortic dilatation rate in the segment of the aorta more prone to dilatation. Tubular ascending aorta for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and sinuses of Valsalva in patients with Marfan syndrome.\nAlthough the mean value is similar\n(0.42 and 0.49 mm/year respectively),\nthe distribution of the population is very different.\nthe possibility of inter-group bias. However, baseline aortic diameter inclusion (larger for DA) and age difference (older for DA) could partially explain the maximum aortic dilatation rates in DA patients being smaller than in MFS and BAV. Also, we used actual blood pressure measurement and not ‘ history of hypertension ’ in our de ﬁ nitions, and the DA group likely has a higher prevalence of hypertension.\nObviously, we could not correct for age as different aortopa- thies are clinically recognised at variable ages of the patients. Age is likely a determinant of dilatation progression and thus limits the quantitative comparison between groups. Importantly, when matching patients with BAV and MFS for ages between 30 – 50 years (BAV 41.5±6, MFS 40.2±6; p=0.27), we observed no difference in maximal progression rate ( p=0.5) and corrobo- rated faster progression of sinuses for MFS and tubular ascend- ing for BAV ( p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the age groups are representative of current clinical practice for each aortopathy, therefore their quantitative comparison seems fair from the clin- ical perspective. Aortic measurements were performed by echo- cardiography which was consistently performed at baseline and follow-up, whereas CT or MRI imaging in accordance with current recommendations 30 was not consistently performed. Nevertheless, echocardiographic measurements remain the current standard of care 30 and in patients with concomitant MRI there was no detectable difference between techniques. Notwithstanding, analysis of aortic arch dimensions was not possible in this study. The results of this study are applicable only to adults ( ≥ 18 years) within a tertiary referral based prac- tice, and are not meant to represent the entire spectrum of MFS and DA, as these were matched by gender to patients with BAV. The conclusions of our study represent the observations made over a 25 – 75 centile interval time of 2.7 – 4.5 years and longer follow-up studies should be performed. Finally, the use of annualised aortic dilatation rates and lack of an intermediate measurement between the ﬁ rst and follow-up echocardiograms limit the analysis of more complex aortic growth attributes such as potential time dependent growth decelerations.\n\n\nClinical/research implications\nIn BAV patients, baseline AA dilatation is most common and independent of valve morphology, while baseline sinus of Valsalva dilatation is associated with typical BAV morphology and male gender. The aortic dilatation rate is maximal at the AA, independent of valve function and morphology, and similar but not greater than that observed at the sinuses of Valsalva in patients with MFS. Thus, dilatation above the STJ should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The observed dilatation rates cannot be inferred from BAV morphology or baseline aortic diameter measured once, and therefore systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Furthermore, because the aortic dilatation rate may signi ﬁ cantly differ between individual patients, only speci ﬁ c follow-up measurements can determine individual size-dependent aortic risk. In addition, although there is an independent association between typical BAV and the predominant Valsalva sinus phenotype, the risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Aortic dilatation rates at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva are signi ﬁ cantly less prominent than AA, supporting a recent report 31 which indicates that preserving the Valsalva sinuses at the time of AA replacement in patients with BAV and no signi ﬁ - cant dilatation of the Valsalva sinuses, was not associated with reintervention due to progressive dilatation of Valsalva sinuses at follow-up. Trials of medical therapy directed at decreasing dila- tation rates would be most revealing when applied to younger\npatients with smaller baseline aortas. Lastly, the dilatation rate heterogeneity and its independence from BAV morphology suggest a higher level of complexity in genetic and environmen- tal determinants of BAV aortopathy, which need to be determined.\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\nWhat is already known about this subject\nBicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with aortic dilatation. Patterns of dilatation are not well de ﬁ ned and comparison with other aortopathies is lacking.\n\n\nWhat does this study add\nIn BAV, tubular ascending aorta dilatation is the most common pattern and exhibits the fastest growing rate, irrespective of valve morphology and function. Sinuses growth rate is slower. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict the progression rate. Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV and Marfan syndrome, but a signi ﬁ cantly higher BAV patient proportion does not progress at all.\n\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice\nDilatation above the sinotubular junction should be closely monitored in BAV patients. The risk of dilatation and aortic surveillance should not be based on BAV morphology. Systematic follow-up is warranted when a BAV is recognised. Surgical preservation of a normal aortic sinuses appears theoretically reasonable. Aortic dilatation patterns are different between BAV and Marfan syndrome patients.\nContributors All authors contributed to: conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and ﬁ nal approval of the version published.\nFunding PHRC AOM09093 (GJ), ANR 2010 BLAN 1129 from the French National Research Agency (GJ).\nCompeting interests None.\nEthics approval Institutional Review Boards of participating centres.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\n\n\nEditor ’ s choice Scan to access more free content 126 Detaint D, et al .

  "section_text": "Introduction\nHIV prevalence in Mozambique is estimated at 1.8% among adolescents (12–14 years), 1.4% in children (0–11 years) and 2.3% in infants (under 1 year) (1). Women are more affected than men, with peak prevalence at ages occurring during reproductive years (2). A prevalence of 29.4% (95% CI: 27.0–31.8%) was found in a study of 1,429 sexually active women; the follow up of 479 uninfected women in the prospective phase found that the incidence of HIV was 4.8 per 100 woman-years (WY) (95% CI: 2.5–8.3) in women aged 18–24 years, 4.5 per 100 WY (95% CI: 1.2–11.4) in women aged 25–29 years and 3.2 per 100 WY (95% CI: 0.1–18.0) in the 30–35 years stratum (3). A high\nHIV incidence in the postpartum period has been shown to sustain vertical transmission in a cohort study in Southern Mozambique, which found an HIV incidence in postpartum women at 3.20/100 women-years (95% CI: 2.30–4.46), with the highest rate among 18- to 19-year-old (4.92 per 100 women-years; 95% CI: 2.65–9.15) (4).

The routine management of these children includes provision of antiretroviral therapy, and periodic assessment of its results and complications. However, no systematic assessment of the nutritional status, lipid profile or screening for cardiovascular disease is done. Our study aimed at describing the occurrence of cardiovascular abnormalities in HIV-infected children under antiretroviral therapy, and at determining the vital outcomes 5 years after. A prospective observational study was implemented at a dedicated HIV center in Maputo City, where we gathered detailed socio-demographic data and performed full cardiovascular evaluation, including transthoracic cardiac ultrasound. A total of 47 children were examined (24 male) of which 10 had abnormal cardiac ultrasound: impaired systolic function (5 children); three had congenital heart defects; one had severe rheumatic aortic regurgitation and one had tuberculous pericarditis. Heart failure was present in five children. The study also uncovered the presence of malnutrition (36 patients; 80% had BMI below 18.5 kg/m 2 ) and anemia in a considerable proportion of children. On 5 year follow up there was one death due to malária; three new cases of left ventricular dysfunction occurred among children who had normal ultrasound on recruitment. Our results support systematic cardiovascular risk profiling and disease screening in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy, using cardiac ultrasound wherever possible.\nKeywords: Pediatric HIV; antiretroviral therapy (ART); cardiac abnormalities\nSubmitted Aug 01, 2018.

Using systematic sampling from available electronic database, we randomly selected 10% of the registered patients. Recruitment took place between April/2012 and October/2012, since every child as a routine follow up appointment every six months. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic characteristics, cardiovascular symptoms and signs, laboratory profile as well data on ART. The cardiovascular evaluation included transthoracic cardiac ultrasound. Venous blood was obtained to assess the hemoglobin level, CD4 count and HIV viral load. The clinical status was defined as per the World Health Organization criteria (5), anemia was defined according to age-appropriate reference standards (6), immunological and virological statuses were measured by CD4 and viral load, respectively. Severe left ventricular dysfunction was defined as shortening fraction below 30% (7). First line ART regimen comprised of two\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine and lamivudine) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine); stavudine replaced Zidovudine when hemoglobin was less than 8 gr/dL. For second line therapy Abacavir/lamivudine are used in fixed combined dosage. Patients found with significant cardiac abnormalities were offered treatment.\nFive years after, we assessed patient’s vital status, occurrence of major clinical events, and performed transthoracic cardiac ultrasound in those who presented for evaluation. For patients who did not present for consultation we assessed the files at the health facility and contacted the family to obtain information on their vital status and history of hospital admissions.\nData were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPPS) version 20. The National Bioethics Review Board in Mozambique approved the study. Parents or guardians gave written informed consent and verbal assent was obtained for children above the age of seven.\n\n\nResults\nWe studied 47 children patients [23 girls; median age 9 years (IQR 6–11); all black]. The body mass index (BMI) average was 16.2 (range, 10.1–22.8) kg/m 2 ; 36 patients (80%) had BMI below 18.5 kg/m 2 . The mean time of treatment was 52.4 months. According to the WHO HIV clinical classification 37 (78.7%) patients were in stage 1–2; none were in stage IV. The median CD4 count was 900 cells/mm 3 (IQR 488–1,258). Low HIV viral load (less than 50 copies) was found in only 28 (59.6%) patients. Five children (10.6%) were on second line treatment. The median hemoglobin level was 11.6 g/dL (IQR 10.6, 12.5) and 7 (14.9%) of the children had anemia. The characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1 . Five children had clinical features of heart failure. Cardiac ultrasound revealed cardiac abnormalities in 10 children: congenital heart defects (two atrial septal defect and one aneurysm of the coronary sinus); impaired systolic function (present in five children of which two had overt heart failure); severe aortic regurgitation of rheumatic origin (1 of 47) and tuberculous pericarditis (1 of 47) ( Table 2 ). After medical therapy patients with heart failure, impaired systolic function, tuberculous pericarditis and anemia were treated, and all improved. The child with severe rheumatic disease underwent surgery with success. All children benefited from nutritional support and/or rehabilitation as part of the program at the institution.\nTable 1 Demographic, clinical and HIV-related biological characteristics of 47 participants enrolled in the study at baseline\nART, antiretroviral therapy.\nThe evaluation after five years revealed that we had six patients lost to follow-up, of which three with cardiac abnormalities. One patient died from malaria in year 2. No major cardiac events or hospital admissions occurred in the remaining 40.\nNew asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate mitral regurgitation appeared in three children (aged 9, 7 and 6) who had normal cardiac ultrasound at recruitment; one with mild, one with moderate and one with severe anemia.\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nSevere left ventricular dysfunction, malnutrition and anemia were uncovered in these HIV-infected children on ART, supporting the inclusion of systematic risk profiling and cardiovascular screening in routine care in Mozambique and underserved settings with high occurrence of cardiovascular disease. This is particularly important since adequate management of these abnormalities was associated with good outcomes, and survival free of major events. Only one child died due to a non-cardiac event.\nThe cardiac abnormalities found, although rare in pediatric HIV population with access to modern ART, correspond to the profile of cardiac disease in our setting (8,9). Similarly, cardiac abnormalities detected by cardiac ultrasound were found in 20 out of 285 HIV-infected Ugandan children on ART: left ventricular dysfunction in 6 (2.1%), dilated cardiomyopathy 1 child, congenital heart disease in 3 children (1%)—patent ductus arteriosus,\nsecundum atrial septal defect and isolated cleft mitral valve—and acquired heart disease in 10 (pericardial disease in 8 and rheumatic heart disease in 2) (10).\nWe found patients with undiagnosed heart failure and congenital heart disease, reflecting both the occurrence of asymptomatic cardiac disease and issues of access to timely diagnosis. This further confirms the importance of using ultrasound for cardiovascular screening of HIV-infected children. A study of Indian children has shown that heart involvement in HIV/AIDS is mostly subclinical (11) and highlighted the role of cardiac ultrasound for identifying heart involvement in this age group. Since HIV infection is usually associated with heart failure, and because early diagnosis and intervention may halt the progression of cardiac disease, thereby preventing morbidity and mortality, these results call active cardiovascular screening in HIV- infected children from low-income countries with high occurrence of cardiac conditions.\nA significant proportion of children had low BMI and anemia. Current knowledge suggests the need for aggressive approaches to correcting these conditions, since they increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (12). We had three new cases of left systolic dysfunction on 5-year follow up, two of which had in children that had very low hemoglobin levels at recruitment. Although these children had recovered their anemia, it is well known that low hemoglobin levels partially mediate chamber dilation in ART-exposed children (13,14), and thus efforts should be made to correct it vigorously. On the other hand, despite controversy regarding the effect of ART\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristic of children with cardiac abnormalities on echocardiography\nLFU, lost of follow up; LV, left ventricular.\non the levels of hemoglobin, a recent study of HIV-infected children with median age of 10 years in Ethiopia showed reduction on prevalence of anemia after ART initiation (15). Similarly, successful treatment can be achieved for HIV- infected children in Mozambique and in similar resource- limited settings (16).\nAlthough overall encouraging and in line with the good results of ART in preventing cardiac events in adult population, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small size of our cohort and the loss to follow up of three patients with cardiac abnormalities.\nThe pathogenesis and long-term outcomes of ART in children are not well understood, but even in the context of viral suppression there seems to be an increased cardiovascular risk due to metabolic syndrome compared to that of uninfected children (13,17,18). One limitation of our study was the fact that we were not able to have the lipid profile done. We however acknowledge that in African children starting ART so early in life monitoring of metabolic markers and atherosclerotic risk, must be added to the usual screening of geographically relevant cardiovascular conditions.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the staff at the Non-Communicable Disease Division of Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Hospital da Polana Caniço, Community of S.Egidio-DREAM program Avenida Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo City, and to all the participants who gave their time, support and enthusiasm in making this study a success.

We however acknowledge that in African children starting ART so early in life monitoring of metabolic markers and atherosclerotic risk, must be added to the usual screening of geographically relevant cardiovascular conditions.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the staff at the Non-Communicable Disease Division of Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Hospital da Polana Caniço, Community of S.Egidio-DREAM program Avenida Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo City, and to all the participants who gave their time, support and enthusiasm in making this study a success.

Women are more affected than men, with peak prevalence at ages occurring during reproductive years (2). A prevalence of 29.4% (95% CI: 27.0–31.8%) was found in a study of 1,429 sexually active women; the follow up of 479 uninfected women in the prospective phase found that the incidence of HIV was 4.8 per 100 woman-years (WY) (95% CI: 2.5–8.3) in women aged 18–24 years, 4.5 per 100 WY (95% CI: 1.2–11.4) in women aged 25–29 years and 3.2 per 100 WY (95% CI: 0.1–18.0) in the 30–35 years stratum (3). A high\nHIV incidence in the postpartum period has been shown to sustain vertical transmission in a cohort study in Southern Mozambique, which found an HIV incidence in postpartum women at 3.20/100 women-years (95% CI: 2.30–4.46), with the highest rate among 18- to 19-year-old (4.92 per 100 women-years; 95% CI: 2.65–9.15) (4).

The routine management of these children includes provision of antiretroviral therapy, and periodic assessment of its results and complications. However, no systematic assessment of the nutritional status, lipid profile or screening for cardiovascular disease is done. Our study aimed at describing the occurrence of cardiovascular abnormalities in HIV-infected children under antiretroviral therapy, and at determining the vital outcomes 5 years after. A prospective observational study was implemented at a dedicated HIV center in Maputo City, where we gathered detailed socio-demographic data and performed full cardiovascular evaluation, including transthoracic cardiac ultrasound. A total of 47 children were examined (24 male) of which 10 had abnormal cardiac ultrasound: impaired systolic function (5 children); three had congenital heart defects; one had severe rheumatic aortic regurgitation and one had tuberculous pericarditis. Heart failure was present in five children. The study also uncovered the presence of malnutrition (36 patients; 80% had BMI below 18.5 kg/m 2 ) and anemia in a considerable proportion of children. On 5 year follow up there was one death due to malária; three new cases of left ventricular dysfunction occurred among children who had normal ultrasound on recruitment. Our results support systematic cardiovascular risk profiling and disease screening in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy, using cardiac ultrasound wherever possible.\nKeywords: Pediatric HIV; antiretroviral therapy (ART); cardiac abnormalities\nSubmitted Aug 01, 2018.

Using systematic sampling from available electronic database, we randomly selected 10% of the registered patients. Recruitment took place between April/2012 and October/2012, since every child as a routine follow up appointment every six months. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic characteristics, cardiovascular symptoms and signs, laboratory profile as well data on ART. The cardiovascular evaluation included transthoracic cardiac ultrasound. Venous blood was obtained to assess the hemoglobin level, CD4 count and HIV viral load. The clinical status was defined as per the World Health Organization criteria (5), anemia was defined according to age-appropriate reference standards (6), immunological and virological statuses were measured by CD4 and viral load, respectively. Severe left ventricular dysfunction was defined as shortening fraction below 30% (7). First line ART regimen comprised of two\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine and lamivudine) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine); stavudine replaced Zidovudine when hemoglobin was less than 8 gr/dL. For second line therapy Abacavir/lamivudine are used in fixed combined dosage. Patients found with significant cardiac abnormalities were offered treatment.\nFive years after, we assessed patient’s vital status, occurrence of major clinical events, and performed transthoracic cardiac ultrasound in those who presented for evaluation. For patients who did not present for consultation we assessed the files at the health facility and contacted the family to obtain information on their vital status and history of hospital admissions.\nData were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPPS) version 20. The National Bioethics Review Board in Mozambique approved the study. Parents or guardians gave written informed consent and verbal assent was obtained for children above the age of seven.\n\n\nResults\nWe studied 47 children patients [23 girls; median age 9 years (IQR 6–11); all black]. The body mass index (BMI) average was 16.2 (range, 10.1–22.8) kg/m 2 ; 36 patients (80%) had BMI below 18.5 kg/m 2 . The mean time of treatment was 52.4 months. According to the WHO HIV clinical classification 37 (78.7%) patients were in stage 1–2; none were in stage IV. The median CD4 count was 900 cells/mm 3 (IQR 488–1,258). Low HIV viral load (less than 50 copies) was found in only 28 (59.6%) patients. Five children (10.6%) were on second line treatment. The median hemoglobin level was 11.6 g/dL (IQR 10.6, 12.5) and 7 (14.9%) of the children had anemia. The characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1 . Five children had clinical features of heart failure. Cardiac ultrasound revealed cardiac abnormalities in 10 children: congenital heart defects (two atrial septal defect and one aneurysm of the coronary sinus); impaired systolic function (present in five children of which two had overt heart failure); severe aortic regurgitation of rheumatic origin (1 of 47) and tuberculous pericarditis (1 of 47) ( Table 2 ). After medical therapy patients with heart failure, impaired systolic function, tuberculous pericarditis and anemia were treated, and all improved. The child with severe rheumatic disease underwent surgery with success. All children benefited from nutritional support and/or rehabilitation as part of the program at the institution.\nTable 1 Demographic, clinical and HIV-related biological characteristics of 47 participants enrolled in the study at baseline\nART, antiretroviral therapy.\nThe evaluation after five years revealed that we had six patients lost to follow-up, of which three with cardiac abnormalities. One patient died from malaria in year 2. No major cardiac events or hospital admissions occurred in the remaining 40.\nNew asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate mitral regurgitation appeared in three children (aged 9, 7 and 6) who had normal cardiac ultrasound at recruitment; one with mild, one with moderate and one with severe anemia.\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nSevere left ventricular dysfunction, malnutrition and anemia were uncovered in these HIV-infected children on ART, supporting the inclusion of systematic risk profiling and cardiovascular screening in routine care in Mozambique and underserved settings with high occurrence of cardiovascular disease. This is particularly important since adequate management of these abnormalities was associated with good outcomes, and survival free of major events. Only one child died due to a non-cardiac event.\nThe cardiac abnormalities found, although rare in pediatric HIV population with access to modern ART, correspond to the profile of cardiac disease in our setting (8,9). Similarly, cardiac abnormalities detected by cardiac ultrasound were found in 20 out of 285 HIV-infected Ugandan children on ART: left ventricular dysfunction in 6 (2.1%), dilated cardiomyopathy 1 child, congenital heart disease in 3 children (1%)—patent ductus arteriosus,\nsecundum atrial septal defect and isolated cleft mitral valve—and acquired heart disease in 10 (pericardial disease in 8 and rheumatic heart disease in 2) (10).\nWe found patients with undiagnosed heart failure and congenital heart disease, reflecting both the occurrence of asymptomatic cardiac disease and issues of access to timely diagnosis. This further confirms the importance of using ultrasound for cardiovascular screening of HIV-infected children. A study of Indian children has shown that heart involvement in HIV/AIDS is mostly subclinical (11) and highlighted the role of cardiac ultrasound for identifying heart involvement in this age group. Since HIV infection is usually associated with heart failure, and because early diagnosis and intervention may halt the progression of cardiac disease, thereby preventing morbidity and mortality, these results call active cardiovascular screening in HIV- infected children from low-income countries with high occurrence of cardiac conditions.\nA significant proportion of children had low BMI and anemia. Current knowledge suggests the need for aggressive approaches to correcting these conditions, since they increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (12). We had three new cases of left systolic dysfunction on 5-year follow up, two of which had in children that had very low hemoglobin levels at recruitment. Although these children had recovered their anemia, it is well known that low hemoglobin levels partially mediate chamber dilation in ART-exposed children (13,14), and thus efforts should be made to correct it vigorously. On the other hand, despite controversy regarding the effect of ART\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristic of children with cardiac abnormalities on echocardiography\nLFU, lost of follow up; LV, left ventricular.\non the levels of hemoglobin, a recent study of HIV-infected children with median age of 10 years in Ethiopia showed reduction on prevalence of anemia after ART initiation (15). Similarly, successful treatment can be achieved for HIV- infected children in Mozambique and in similar resource- limited settings (16).\nAlthough overall encouraging and in line with the good results of ART in preventing cardiac events in adult population, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small size of our cohort and the loss to follow up of three patients with cardiac abnormalities.\nThe pathogenesis and long-term outcomes of ART in children are not well understood, but even in the context of viral suppression there seems to be an increased cardiovascular risk due to metabolic syndrome compared to that of uninfected children (13,17,18).

We however acknowledge that in African children starting ART so early in life monitoring of metabolic markers and atherosclerotic risk, must be added to the usual screening of geographically relevant cardiovascular conditions.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the staff at the Non-Communicable Disease Division of Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Hospital da Polana Caniço, Community of S.Egidio-DREAM program Avenida Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo City, and to all the participants who gave their time, support and enthusiasm in making this study a success.

A study of Indian children has shown that heart involvement in HIV/AIDS is mostly subclinical (11) and highlighted the role of cardiac ultrasound for identifying heart involvement in this age group. Since HIV infection is usually associated with heart failure, and because early diagnosis and intervention may halt the progression of cardiac disease, thereby preventing morbidity and mortality, these results call active cardiovascular screening in HIV- infected children from low-income countries with high occurrence of cardiac conditions.\nA significant proportion of children had low BMI and anemia. Current knowledge suggests the need for aggressive approaches to correcting these conditions, since they increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (12). We had three new cases of left systolic dysfunction on 5-year follow up, two of which had in children that had very low hemoglobin levels at recruitment. Although these children had recovered their anemia, it is well known that low hemoglobin levels partially mediate chamber dilation in ART-exposed children (13,14), and thus efforts should be made to correct it vigorously. On the other hand, despite controversy regarding the effect of ART\n\n\nTable 2 Baseline characteristic of children with cardiac abnormalities on echocardiography\nLFU, lost of follow up; LV, left ventricular.\non the levels of hemoglobin, a recent study of HIV-infected children with median age of 10 years in Ethiopia showed reduction on prevalence of anemia after ART initiation (15). Similarly, successful treatment can be achieved for HIV- infected children in Mozambique and in similar resource- limited settings (16).\nAlthough overall encouraging and in line with the good results of ART in preventing cardiac events in adult population, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small size of our cohort and the loss to follow up of three patients with cardiac abnormalities.\nThe pathogenesis and long-term outcomes of ART in children are not well understood, but even in the context of viral suppression there seems to be an increased cardiovascular risk due to metabolic syndrome compared to that of uninfected children (13,17,18). One limitation of our study was the fact that we were not able to have the lipid profile done. We however acknowledge that in African children starting ART so early in life monitoring of metabolic markers and atherosclerotic risk, must be added to the usual screening of geographically relevant cardiovascular conditions.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the staff at the Non-Communicable Disease Division of Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Hospital da Polana Caniço, Community of S.Egidio-DREAM program Avenida Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo City, and to all the participants who gave their time, support and enthusiasm in making this study a success.

Setting: Brazil, Sa˜o Paulo. Methods: Observational, prospective and cross-study. Eligible patients ( n ¼ 100) had SI by SCI, 4 18 years. The degree of motor and sensory lesion was evaluated based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Blood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, laboratory and biochemical analyses. Ultrasonography analyzes were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes.\nResults: The main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nConclusion: There is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI. Therefore, the conduct of the investigation for thrombophilia should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332; doi:10.1038/sc.2013.170; published online 11 February 2014\nKeywords: thromboembolism; spinal cord injury; Leiden factor V; hyperhomocysteinemia.\nThe venous thromboembolism (VT), that involves deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, is considered a common disease, with annual incidence of one to three cases per 1000 individuals. 1 There are many factors related to VT, including age, male gender, pelvic and lower limb fractures and spinal injury (SI). 2\nIt is well established in the literature the relation between DVT and SI. This incidence has increased in the last years, 3 ranging between 18 and 100%, depending on the diagnostic methods used, lesion time, associated risk factors and prophylactic treatment. 4 Sequelae from SI can affect the three components from classic Virchow triad, responsible for the genesis of VT: blood flow changes, endothelial cell damage and production of procoagulants, leading to hyper- coagulability state. Besides, pulmonary embolism is the serious complication and is the second leading death cause in these patients. The incidence of pulmonary embolism varies between 4.6 and 14% of the cases, being fatal between 1.7 and 4.7%. 5\nIn the venous system vascular, many changes can induce DVT, for example, partial or total paralysis of the muscles, affecting the blood flow due changes in the venous competence, causing the reduction in the capacity and distensibility of vascular bed and increase in the\nvenous flow resistance. These factors promote metabolic changes in blood vessels generating hypoxia associated to endothelial cell damage in the vessel wall, adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade activation and venous thrombosis. The hypercoagulability in the patients with SI is due to multiple mechanisms, including coagulation cascade activation, modifications in endothelial and other blood cells. 6\nMany genetic components constitute risk factors for VT. The majority affects the natural pathways of coagulation, mainly the C protein system. Resistance to activated C protein is the hyper- coagulability state more frequently associated with the pulmonary embolism development, caused by a Leiden factor V gene mutation (Arg 506 for Gly). 1 This mutation is found only in Caucasians, but the prevalence varies among the different countries. 7 The second most frequent mutation occurs in the not translated position 3 in the prothrombin gene (G 20210 A). 8 Less frequent genetic changes are the scarcity in the natural anticoagulant proteins (anti-thrombin, C and S protein). 1 Other acquired risk factors are sedentarism and tabagism, 9 lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, hyperhomo- cysteinemia and increase of coagulation factors, mainly factors I and VIII. 1\n1 Department of Pathology, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 2 Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 3 Clinics Hospital, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 4 Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 5 Santo Amaro University, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 6 Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil and 7 Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.

Patients ( n ¼ 100) were recruited from the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital USP— IMREA/Lucy Montoro Network, from January 2011 to April 2012. Eligible patients had SI by SCI, 4 18 years; the exclusion criteria were patients with SI for other reasons (not SCI), as cancer, lupus, multiple sclerosis, spinal compression by disc herniation, motor sequelae from stroke or subjects that presented clinical signs compatible with infection. The fluxogram is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\nVariables from the study\nThe variables investigated were: age, gender, race, type of SI (paraplegia or tetraplegia), injury time, etiology of SI and degree of motor and sensory lesion, using the American Spinal Injury Associa- tion (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), or Scale of Deficiency from ASIA, created in 1992, with review in 2011, and adopted worldwide in the specialized centers in the care subjects with SI. This classification is defined, according to modifications from Frankel, 10 as ASIA A (complete motor and sensory impairments), ASIA B (loss of motor function with sensitive function preserved, below the neurological level, including the sensitive sacral nerve S4–S5), ASIA C ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, presenting strength less than degree 3), ASIA D ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, showing strength greater than or equal degree 3) and ASIA E (normal sensory and motor functions). Summarily, the classifications ASIA A and B are complete motor lesion and ASIA C and D incomplete motor lesion.\nOther variables analyzed were VT evaluation by duplex scan ultrasonography, laboratory exams, prothrombin time, clottable fibrinogen, dosage of factor VIII, C protein of coagulation, antigen- free S protein, anti-thrombin, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardi- olipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, Leiden factor V, prothrombin mutation (factor II) and D-Dimer dosage.\n\n\nBlood sampling and exam analyses\nBlood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, real- time PCR and biochemical analyses. Plasma was freezed to 70 1 C for evaluating prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, quantitative D-Dimer, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, search for lupus anticoagulant. Serum was refrigerated to 4 1 C for searching of IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies and homocysteine. DNA was obtained from samples collected in EDTA tubes refrigerated to 4 1 C, for analyzing the presence of mutations in Leiden factor V and prothrombin (G20210 A).\n\n\nLaboratory exams\nThe analyzes of laboratory exams were performed in the Clinical Pathology Department from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for determining the International Normalized Ratio, fibrinogen, factor VIII dosage, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, quantitative D-Dimer, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, homocysteine and genetic tests.\n\n\nReal-time PCR\nGenomic DNA was obtained from 200 ul of peripheral blood using the bioMe´rieux NucliSens easyMAG. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes, using Taqman probes ABI7500 instrument and kits for allelic discrimination ABI Taqman (Applied Biosystem, San Diego, CA, USA). Primer sequences and probes are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nUltrasonography exams\nUltrasonography analyses were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs (proximal and distal veins), using linear transducer of 7.5 MHz and Siemens equipment Sonoline G40 (Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA). Two-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed Doppler and Color Doppler flow mapping were employed. Appropriate probes were selected according to the depth of the vessels examined.

Veins were investigated in longitudinal and transversal views. Diagnostic criteria used for confirming or exclude DVT was based on compression test and the absence or presence of endoluminal material. The test was considered negative if the veins were totally compressible and without thrombus, positive when the veins were incompressible combined with the direct image of an endoluminal thrombus.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables are presented as n (%) and absolute frequencies and numerical variables are expressed as median (interquartile range). The investigation to the factors associated to the thrombosis occurrence was performed in two stages: simple analysis, using Pearson’s Chi-square, exact Fisher or Mann–Whitney tests for evaluating the association between the characteristics of interest and the occurrence of thrombosis and multiple analysis, using logistic regression models for verifying the influence of the variables of interest in the thrombosis occurrence. Statistical significance was set at a P -value of o 0.05. All analyses were made using the SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nThe trial protocol was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the institute on human experimentation and approval was obtained from the local ethics committee for analysis of research projects (1201/09). Informed consent was obtained from all partici- pants prior to inclusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe subjects ( n ¼ 100) were 72% men, 65% white race, 83% did rehabilitation, with a mean age of 39 years and a s.d. of 13.11 (range 20–76) years. Concerning the type of SI, 63% presented paraplegia and the most frequent etiologies were motor vehicle accident (35%), accidental fall (25%) and injury by firearms (17%). Other etiologies were observed in 23% of the patients (Table 3).\nClinical presentations were ASIA A (41%), followed by B (23%), C (19%) and D (17%); 9% of the patients had heterotopic ossification and 83% made rehabilitation. All the patients performed laboratory and image exams. The DVT occurrence was confirmed in 17% of the patients that made Doppler ultrasonography of bilateral lower limb.\nThe multivariate approach showed that the occurrence of DVT is bigger among individuals with homocysteinemia, with values between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 (odds ratio 25.67, P -value o 0.001) and among individuals with presence of Leiden factor V (odds ratio 51.51, P -value ¼ 0.013) (Table 4, Figures 2 and 3).\nThe investigation of the factors associated to the occurrence of thrombosis showed more frequency in individuals with paresis, that made big surgeries, with lower C and S protein dosage, increased\nhomocysteine (between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 ). Other factors associated to DVT occurrence were the presence of genetic polymorphism of Leiden factor V (Table 5). There were changes in the quantitative D-Dimer in 70.6% of the patients that showed DVT and 43.4% in those patients without DVT. Concerning the time of lesion, the median was 1.3 years among patients without DVT and median of 2.4 years among patients with DVT.\nIt was investigated the association between some characteristics observed and changes in D-Dimer (Table 5). Values of D-Dimer above the reference were found in 46% of the patients with paraplegia and 51.4% of the patients with tetraplegia, showing that there were no differences in the lesions ( P ¼ 0.607). There were no significant differences between D-Dimer greater than reference value and ASIA classification. There was association between changes in D-Dimer and fibrinogen ( P o 0.001), and the changes in D-Dimer in patients with values 4 400 are more frequent (72.3%) than between patients with normal dosages (26.7%). This evaluation was performed in the subgroup without DVT and the results were similar (not shown).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of DVT in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia, contrary that was thought in the study design. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nDVT is a multigenic and multifactorial disease; the interrelation of the risk factors lead to the thrombosis. 1 Besides, age is an isolated risk for DVT, mainly after 40 years. 11 In this study, 51% of the patients had age o 40 years (80.4% without DVT and 19.6% with DVT). Although the results not show statistical significance, the population was young, most men that can have association with the results, impacting in the low frequency of thrombosis, 17%. Experimental studies with fibrinogen scanning marked with I 125 showed presence of DVT in 100% of the patients with SI for acute SCI evaluated. 12\nThe majority of the studies in the literature evaluated patients with SI for acute SCI. 9,13–15 In this study, patients were analyzed with time lesion 4 1 year (median of 1.3 years among the patients without DVT and 2.4 years among patients with DVT). There are studies that show adaptation of many organic and functional systems in patients with SI. 15,16 Many factors can contribute to the higher occurrence of thrombosis in these patients. The permanent venous vasodilatation state in the lower limbs promotes lower speed of blood flow and stasis as constant risk factor. Experimental studies of spinal transection in mice showed increase in 1.5 times the diameter in femoral and saphenous veins. 15 Patients with SI present frequently dehydration and secondary increase of blood viscosity that can complicate the stasis and local hypoxia. 17\nThe higher the degree of muscle paralysis, the greater the tendency of slowing the blood flow, because of the loss of\n\n\nTable 1 Primer sequences and probes for Leiden Factor V\nAbbreviations: GPL, IgG phospholipid units; IQR, Interquartile range; MPL, IgM phospholipid units.

(1997) simulated venoestase state in upper and lower limbs in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia, up to 6 months of SCI, compared with 10 normal volunteers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the fibrinolytic system and the risk of DVT after SCI. After venoestase upper limbs, the tissue plasminogen activator increased significantly in patients as in the control group, but no significant changes in the lower limbs. The prolonged stasis not allowed that the fibrinolytic response level in the lower limbs was the same as observed in the upper limbs. The dosage of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) did not change significantly after hypoxic state, although there was variation in dosages between individuals. In this study, 75% of patients with thrombosis had increased levels of D-Dimer but all patients had normal levels of thrombin–anti-thrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 þ 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by increased levels of D-Dimer without recovery of the fibrinolytic system suggests perennial antithrombotic treatment in therapeutic doses. 19\nIversen published a study in 2002 about hemostatic abnormalities and tetraplegia, concluding that circadian variations of several coagulation factors and fibrinolytic system are increased in patients with SI, due to a possible deregulation of the autonomic nervous system reflex, leading to a dysfunction between the variations central and peripheral circadian. 20 This could possibly reflect the deregulated autonomic nervous system, leading to a dysfunctional link between central and peripheral circadian oscillators.\nIn this study, 75% of patients with altered D-Dimer ( 4 500 ng ml 1 ), had no DVT (Table 3), confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography, which could suggest that changes in the fibrinolytic system may be a protective mechanism for patients outside the acute phase of SCI ( 4 1 year of SI).\n\n\nTable 4 Factors associated to DVT – multiple regression analysis\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI.\nLaboratory investigation for thrombophilia, including genetic tests, immunologic, coagulation and biochemistry exams, should not be requested in a systematic manner for SI patients by SCI. The conduct of this decision should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nThe adaptation of venous vascular system and changes in the fibrinolytic system need to be better understood and studied in SI patients by SCI for 4 1 year.\nPatients in this study are accompanied in an important National Rehabilitation Center, where all clinical support, mainly psychological and physical therapy, with complete guidance for patients and caregivers are provided. This might have impacted on the results and may not reflect the reality of other services.\n\n\nDATA ARCHIVING\nThere were no data to deposit.\n\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\nJC de Campos Guerra 1,2 , MA Moura˜o 3 , CN Franc ¸ a 4,5 , CDP da Rosa 6 and MN Burattini 1,7\n\n\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332 &amp; 2014 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved 1362-4393/14 www.nature.com/sc\n\n\nClinical suspicion of DVT Duplex Scan or Flebography SCI patients Clinical evaluation FLUXOGRAM Without suspicion of DVT Blood sample collection PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, D-Dimer, C, S and AT proteins, anticoagulant lupus Anti-cardiolipin antibody, homocystein\n\n\nOdds ratio 95% CI for odds ratio P- value LL UL\n\n\nFigure 2 Relation between Leiden Factor V and DVT.

  "section_text": "ORIGINAL ARTICLE\n\n\nImpact of coagulation in the development of thromboembolic events in patients with spinal cord injury\nStudy design: Although the knowledge described about risk factors and venous thromboembolism (VT) in the general population, the impact of these factors in the development of thromboembolic events in patients with spinal injury (SI) caused by spinal cord injury (SCI) is poorly understood.\nObjective: Evaluate the impact of risk factors in the development of thromboembolic events in patients with SCI. Setting: Brazil, Sa˜o Paulo. Methods: Observational, prospective and cross-study. Eligible patients ( n ¼ 100) had SI by SCI, 4 18 years. The degree of motor and sensory lesion was evaluated based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Blood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, laboratory and biochemical analyses. Ultrasonography analyzes were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes.\nResults: The main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nConclusion: There is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI. Therefore, the conduct of the investigation for thrombophilia should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332; doi:10.1038/sc.2013.170; published online 11 February 2014\nKeywords: thromboembolism; spinal cord injury; Leiden factor V; hyperhomocysteinemia.\nThe venous thromboembolism (VT), that involves deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, is considered a common disease, with annual incidence of one to three cases per 1000 individuals. 1 There are many factors related to VT, including age, male gender, pelvic and lower limb fractures and spinal injury (SI). 2\nIt is well established in the literature the relation between DVT and SI. This incidence has increased in the last years, 3 ranging between 18 and 100%, depending on the diagnostic methods used, lesion time, associated risk factors and prophylactic treatment. 4 Sequelae from SI can affect the three components from classic Virchow triad, responsible for the genesis of VT: blood flow changes, endothelial cell damage and production of procoagulants, leading to hyper- coagulability state. Besides, pulmonary embolism is the serious complication and is the second leading death cause in these patients. The incidence of pulmonary embolism varies between 4.6 and 14% of the cases, being fatal between 1.7 and 4.7%. 5\nIn the venous system vascular, many changes can induce DVT, for example, partial or total paralysis of the muscles, affecting the blood flow due changes in the venous competence, causing the reduction in the capacity and distensibility of vascular bed and increase in the\nvenous flow resistance. These factors promote metabolic changes in blood vessels generating hypoxia associated to endothelial cell damage in the vessel wall, adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade activation and venous thrombosis. The hypercoagulability in the patients with SI is due to multiple mechanisms, including coagulation cascade activation, modifications in endothelial and other blood cells. 6\nMany genetic components constitute risk factors for VT. The majority affects the natural pathways of coagulation, mainly the C protein system. Resistance to activated C protein is the hyper- coagulability state more frequently associated with the pulmonary embolism development, caused by a Leiden factor V gene mutation (Arg 506 for Gly). 1 This mutation is found only in Caucasians, but the prevalence varies among the different countries. 7 The second most frequent mutation occurs in the not translated position 3 in the prothrombin gene (G 20210 A). 8 Less frequent genetic changes are the scarcity in the natural anticoagulant proteins (anti-thrombin, C and S protein). 1 Other acquired risk factors are sedentarism and tabagism, 9 lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, hyperhomo- cysteinemia and increase of coagulation factors, mainly factors I and VIII. 1\n1 Department of Pathology, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 2 Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 3 Clinics Hospital, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 4 Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 5 Santo Amaro University, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 6 Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil and 7 Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.

Patients ( n ¼ 100) were recruited from the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital USP— IMREA/Lucy Montoro Network, from January 2011 to April 2012. Eligible patients had SI by SCI, 4 18 years; the exclusion criteria were patients with SI for other reasons (not SCI), as cancer, lupus, multiple sclerosis, spinal compression by disc herniation, motor sequelae from stroke or subjects that presented clinical signs compatible with infection. The fluxogram is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\nVariables from the study\nThe variables investigated were: age, gender, race, type of SI (paraplegia or tetraplegia), injury time, etiology of SI and degree of motor and sensory lesion, using the American Spinal Injury Associa- tion (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), or Scale of Deficiency from ASIA, created in 1992, with review in 2011, and adopted worldwide in the specialized centers in the care subjects with SI. This classification is defined, according to modifications from Frankel, 10 as ASIA A (complete motor and sensory impairments), ASIA B (loss of motor function with sensitive function preserved, below the neurological level, including the sensitive sacral nerve S4–S5), ASIA C ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, presenting strength less than degree 3), ASIA D ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, showing strength greater than or equal degree 3) and ASIA E (normal sensory and motor functions). Summarily, the classifications ASIA A and B are complete motor lesion and ASIA C and D incomplete motor lesion.\nOther variables analyzed were VT evaluation by duplex scan ultrasonography, laboratory exams, prothrombin time, clottable fibrinogen, dosage of factor VIII, C protein of coagulation, antigen- free S protein, anti-thrombin, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardi- olipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, Leiden factor V, prothrombin mutation (factor II) and D-Dimer dosage.\n\n\nBlood sampling and exam analyses\nBlood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, real- time PCR and biochemical analyses. Plasma was freezed to 70 1 C for evaluating prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, quantitative D-Dimer, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, search for lupus anticoagulant. Serum was refrigerated to 4 1 C for searching of IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies and homocysteine. DNA was obtained from samples collected in EDTA tubes refrigerated to 4 1 C, for analyzing the presence of mutations in Leiden factor V and prothrombin (G20210 A).\n\n\nLaboratory exams\nThe analyzes of laboratory exams were performed in the Clinical Pathology Department from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for determining the International Normalized Ratio, fibrinogen, factor VIII dosage, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, quantitative D-Dimer, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, homocysteine and genetic tests.\n\n\nReal-time PCR\nGenomic DNA was obtained from 200 ul of peripheral blood using the bioMe´rieux NucliSens easyMAG. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes, using Taqman probes ABI7500 instrument and kits for allelic discrimination ABI Taqman (Applied Biosystem, San Diego, CA, USA). Primer sequences and probes are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nUltrasonography exams\nUltrasonography analyses were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs (proximal and distal veins), using linear transducer of 7.5 MHz and Siemens equipment Sonoline G40 (Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA). Two-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed Doppler and Color Doppler flow mapping were employed. Appropriate probes were selected according to the depth of the vessels examined. Doppler ultrasonography was executed in common\nLeiden Factor V, G20210 Prothrombin (real time PCR) Result analysis Figure 1 Fluxogram of the study.

PT, prothrombin time; aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time.\nfemoral vein for analyzing the flow as a measure of evaluation of iliac vein perviety, as well as b-mode image.\nThe venous system was evaluated bilaterally. Veins were investigated in longitudinal and transversal views. Diagnostic criteria used for confirming or exclude DVT was based on compression test and the absence or presence of endoluminal material. The test was considered negative if the veins were totally compressible and without thrombus, positive when the veins were incompressible combined with the direct image of an endoluminal thrombus.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables are presented as n (%) and absolute frequencies and numerical variables are expressed as median (interquartile range). The investigation to the factors associated to the thrombosis occurrence was performed in two stages: simple analysis, using Pearson’s Chi-square, exact Fisher or Mann–Whitney tests for evaluating the association between the characteristics of interest and the occurrence of thrombosis and multiple analysis, using logistic regression models for verifying the influence of the variables of interest in the thrombosis occurrence. Statistical significance was set at a P -value of o 0.05. All analyses were made using the SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nThe trial protocol was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the institute on human experimentation and approval was obtained from the local ethics committee for analysis of research projects (1201/09). Informed consent was obtained from all partici- pants prior to inclusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe subjects ( n ¼ 100) were 72% men, 65% white race, 83% did rehabilitation, with a mean age of 39 years and a s.d. of 13.11 (range 20–76) years. Concerning the type of SI, 63% presented paraplegia and the most frequent etiologies were motor vehicle accident (35%), accidental fall (25%) and injury by firearms (17%). Other etiologies were observed in 23% of the patients (Table 3).\nClinical presentations were ASIA A (41%), followed by B (23%), C (19%) and D (17%); 9% of the patients had heterotopic ossification and 83% made rehabilitation. All the patients performed laboratory and image exams. The DVT occurrence was confirmed in 17% of the patients that made Doppler ultrasonography of bilateral lower limb.\nThe multivariate approach showed that the occurrence of DVT is bigger among individuals with homocysteinemia, with values between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 (odds ratio 25.67, P -value o 0.001) and among individuals with presence of Leiden factor V (odds ratio 51.51, P -value ¼ 0.013) (Table 4, Figures 2 and 3).\nThe investigation of the factors associated to the occurrence of thrombosis showed more frequency in individuals with paresis, that made big surgeries, with lower C and S protein dosage, increased\nhomocysteine (between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 ). Other factors associated to DVT occurrence were the presence of genetic polymorphism of Leiden factor V (Table 5). There were changes in the quantitative D-Dimer in 70.6% of the patients that showed DVT and 43.4% in those patients without DVT. Concerning the time of lesion, the median was 1.3 years among patients without DVT and median of 2.4 years among patients with DVT.\nIt was investigated the association between some characteristics observed and changes in D-Dimer (Table 5). Values of D-Dimer above the reference were found in 46% of the patients with paraplegia and 51.4% of the patients with tetraplegia, showing that there were no differences in the lesions ( P ¼ 0.607). There were no significant differences between D-Dimer greater than reference value and ASIA classification. There was association between changes in D-Dimer and fibrinogen ( P o 0.001), and the changes in D-Dimer in patients with values 4 400 are more frequent (72.3%) than between patients with normal dosages (26.7%). This evaluation was performed in the subgroup without DVT and the results were similar (not shown).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of DVT in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia, contrary that was thought in the study design. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nDVT is a multigenic and multifactorial disease; the interrelation of the risk factors lead to the thrombosis. 1 Besides, age is an isolated risk for DVT, mainly after 40 years. 11 In this study, 51% of the patients had age o 40 years (80.4% without DVT and 19.6% with DVT). Although the results not show statistical significance, the population was young, most men that can have association with the results, impacting in the low frequency of thrombosis, 17%. Experimental studies with fibrinogen scanning marked with I 125 showed presence of DVT in 100% of the patients with SI for acute SCI evaluated. 12\nThe majority of the studies in the literature evaluated patients with SI for acute SCI. 9,13–15 In this study, patients were analyzed with time lesion 4 1 year (median of 1.3 years among the patients without DVT and 2.4 years among patients with DVT). There are studies that show adaptation of many organic and functional systems in patients with SI. 15,16 Many factors can contribute to the higher occurrence of thrombosis in these patients. The permanent venous vasodilatation state in the lower limbs promotes lower speed of blood flow and stasis as constant risk factor. Experimental studies of spinal transection in mice showed increase in 1.5 times the diameter in femoral and saphenous veins. 15 Patients with SI present frequently dehydration and secondary increase of blood viscosity that can complicate the stasis and local hypoxia. 17\nThe higher the degree of muscle paralysis, the greater the tendency of slowing the blood flow, because of the loss of\n\n\nTable 1 Primer sequences and probes for Leiden Factor V\nAbbreviations: GPL, IgG phospholipid units; IQR, Interquartile range; MPL, IgM phospholipid units.

(1997) simulated venoestase state in upper and lower limbs in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia, up to 6 months of SCI, compared with 10 normal volunteers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the fibrinolytic system and the risk of DVT after SCI. After venoestase upper limbs, the tissue plasminogen activator increased significantly in patients as in the control group, but no significant changes in the lower limbs. The prolonged stasis not allowed that the fibrinolytic response level in the lower limbs was the same as observed in the upper limbs. The dosage of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) did not change significantly after hypoxic state, although there was variation in dosages between individuals. In this study, 75% of patients with thrombosis had increased levels of D-Dimer but all patients had normal levels of thrombin–anti-thrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 þ 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by increased levels of D-Dimer without recovery of the fibrinolytic system suggests perennial antithrombotic treatment in therapeutic doses. 19\nIversen published a study in 2002 about hemostatic abnormalities and tetraplegia, concluding that circadian variations of several coagulation factors and fibrinolytic system are increased in patients with SI, due to a possible deregulation of the autonomic nervous system reflex, leading to a dysfunction between the variations central and peripheral circadian. 20 This could possibly reflect the deregulated autonomic nervous system, leading to a dysfunctional link between central and peripheral circadian oscillators.\nIn this study, 75% of patients with altered D-Dimer ( 4 500 ng ml 1 ), had no DVT (Table 3), confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography, which could suggest that changes in the fibrinolytic system may be a protective mechanism for patients outside the acute phase of SCI ( 4 1 year of SI).\n\n\nTable 4 Factors associated to DVT – multiple regression analysis\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI.\nLaboratory investigation for thrombophilia, including genetic tests, immunologic, coagulation and biochemistry exams, should not be requested in a systematic manner for SI patients by SCI. The conduct of this decision should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nThe adaptation of venous vascular system and changes in the fibrinolytic system need to be better understood and studied in SI patients by SCI for 4 1 year.\nPatients in this study are accompanied in an important National Rehabilitation Center, where all clinical support, mainly psychological and physical therapy, with complete guidance for patients and caregivers are provided. This might have impacted on the results and may not reflect the reality of other services.\n\n\nDATA ARCHIVING\nThere were no data to deposit.\n\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\nJC de Campos Guerra 1,2 , MA Moura˜o 3 , CN Franc ¸ a 4,5 , CDP da Rosa 6 and MN Burattini 1,7\n\n\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332 &amp; 2014 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved 1362-4393/14 www.nature.com/sc\n\n\nClinical suspicion of DVT Duplex Scan or Flebography SCI patients Clinical evaluation FLUXOGRAM Without suspicion of DVT Blood sample collection PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, D-Dimer, C, S and AT proteins, anticoagulant lupus Anti-cardiolipin antibody, homocystein\n\n\nOdds ratio 95% CI for odds ratio P- value LL UL\n\n\nFigure 2 Relation between Leiden Factor V and DVT.

Setting: Brazil, Sa˜o Paulo. Methods: Observational, prospective and cross-study. Eligible patients ( n ¼ 100) had SI by SCI, 4 18 years. The degree of motor and sensory lesion was evaluated based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Blood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, laboratory and biochemical analyses. Ultrasonography analyzes were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes.\nResults: The main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nConclusion: There is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI. Therefore, the conduct of the investigation for thrombophilia should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332; doi:10.1038/sc.2013.170; published online 11 February 2014\nKeywords: thromboembolism; spinal cord injury; Leiden factor V; hyperhomocysteinemia.\nThe venous thromboembolism (VT), that involves deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, is considered a common disease, with annual incidence of one to three cases per 1000 individuals. 1 There are many factors related to VT, including age, male gender, pelvic and lower limb fractures and spinal injury (SI). 2\nIt is well established in the literature the relation between DVT and SI. This incidence has increased in the last years, 3 ranging between 18 and 100%, depending on the diagnostic methods used, lesion time, associated risk factors and prophylactic treatment. 4 Sequelae from SI can affect the three components from classic Virchow triad, responsible for the genesis of VT: blood flow changes, endothelial cell damage and production of procoagulants, leading to hyper- coagulability state. Besides, pulmonary embolism is the serious complication and is the second leading death cause in these patients. The incidence of pulmonary embolism varies between 4.6 and 14% of the cases, being fatal between 1.7 and 4.7%. 5\nIn the venous system vascular, many changes can induce DVT, for example, partial or total paralysis of the muscles, affecting the blood flow due changes in the venous competence, causing the reduction in the capacity and distensibility of vascular bed and increase in the\nvenous flow resistance. These factors promote metabolic changes in blood vessels generating hypoxia associated to endothelial cell damage in the vessel wall, adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade activation and venous thrombosis. The hypercoagulability in the patients with SI is due to multiple mechanisms, including coagulation cascade activation, modifications in endothelial and other blood cells. 6\nMany genetic components constitute risk factors for VT. The majority affects the natural pathways of coagulation, mainly the C protein system. Resistance to activated C protein is the hyper- coagulability state more frequently associated with the pulmonary embolism development, caused by a Leiden factor V gene mutation (Arg 506 for Gly). 1 This mutation is found only in Caucasians, but the prevalence varies among the different countries. 7 The second most frequent mutation occurs in the not translated position 3 in the prothrombin gene (G 20210 A). 8 Less frequent genetic changes are the scarcity in the natural anticoagulant proteins (anti-thrombin, C and S protein). 1 Other acquired risk factors are sedentarism and tabagism, 9 lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, hyperhomo- cysteinemia and increase of coagulation factors, mainly factors I and VIII. 1\n1 Department of Pathology, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 2 Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 3 Clinics Hospital, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 4 Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 5 Santo Amaro University, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 6 Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil and 7 Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.

Patients ( n ¼ 100) were recruited from the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital USP— IMREA/Lucy Montoro Network, from January 2011 to April 2012. Eligible patients had SI by SCI, 4 18 years; the exclusion criteria were patients with SI for other reasons (not SCI), as cancer, lupus, multiple sclerosis, spinal compression by disc herniation, motor sequelae from stroke or subjects that presented clinical signs compatible with infection. The fluxogram is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\nVariables from the study\nThe variables investigated were: age, gender, race, type of SI (paraplegia or tetraplegia), injury time, etiology of SI and degree of motor and sensory lesion, using the American Spinal Injury Associa- tion (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), or Scale of Deficiency from ASIA, created in 1992, with review in 2011, and adopted worldwide in the specialized centers in the care subjects with SI. This classification is defined, according to modifications from Frankel, 10 as ASIA A (complete motor and sensory impairments), ASIA B (loss of motor function with sensitive function preserved, below the neurological level, including the sensitive sacral nerve S4–S5), ASIA C ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, presenting strength less than degree 3), ASIA D ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, showing strength greater than or equal degree 3) and ASIA E (normal sensory and motor functions). Summarily, the classifications ASIA A and B are complete motor lesion and ASIA C and D incomplete motor lesion.\nOther variables analyzed were VT evaluation by duplex scan ultrasonography, laboratory exams, prothrombin time, clottable fibrinogen, dosage of factor VIII, C protein of coagulation, antigen- free S protein, anti-thrombin, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardi- olipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, Leiden factor V, prothrombin mutation (factor II) and D-Dimer dosage.\n\n\nBlood sampling and exam analyses\nBlood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, real- time PCR and biochemical analyses. Plasma was freezed to 70 1 C for evaluating prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, quantitative D-Dimer, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, search for lupus anticoagulant. Serum was refrigerated to 4 1 C for searching of IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies and homocysteine. DNA was obtained from samples collected in EDTA tubes refrigerated to 4 1 C, for analyzing the presence of mutations in Leiden factor V and prothrombin (G20210 A).\n\n\nLaboratory exams\nThe analyzes of laboratory exams were performed in the Clinical Pathology Department from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for determining the International Normalized Ratio, fibrinogen, factor VIII dosage, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, quantitative D-Dimer, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, homocysteine and genetic tests.\n\n\nReal-time PCR\nGenomic DNA was obtained from 200 ul of peripheral blood using the bioMe´rieux NucliSens easyMAG. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes, using Taqman probes ABI7500 instrument and kits for allelic discrimination ABI Taqman (Applied Biosystem, San Diego, CA, USA). Primer sequences and probes are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nUltrasonography exams\nUltrasonography analyses were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs (proximal and distal veins), using linear transducer of 7.5 MHz and Siemens equipment Sonoline G40 (Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA). Two-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed Doppler and Color Doppler flow mapping were employed. Appropriate probes were selected according to the depth of the vessels examined.

Veins were investigated in longitudinal and transversal views. Diagnostic criteria used for confirming or exclude DVT was based on compression test and the absence or presence of endoluminal material. The test was considered negative if the veins were totally compressible and without thrombus, positive when the veins were incompressible combined with the direct image of an endoluminal thrombus.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables are presented as n (%) and absolute frequencies and numerical variables are expressed as median (interquartile range). The investigation to the factors associated to the thrombosis occurrence was performed in two stages: simple analysis, using Pearson’s Chi-square, exact Fisher or Mann–Whitney tests for evaluating the association between the characteristics of interest and the occurrence of thrombosis and multiple analysis, using logistic regression models for verifying the influence of the variables of interest in the thrombosis occurrence. Statistical significance was set at a P -value of o 0.05. All analyses were made using the SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nThe trial protocol was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the institute on human experimentation and approval was obtained from the local ethics committee for analysis of research projects (1201/09). Informed consent was obtained from all partici- pants prior to inclusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe subjects ( n ¼ 100) were 72% men, 65% white race, 83% did rehabilitation, with a mean age of 39 years and a s.d. of 13.11 (range 20–76) years. Concerning the type of SI, 63% presented paraplegia and the most frequent etiologies were motor vehicle accident (35%), accidental fall (25%) and injury by firearms (17%). Other etiologies were observed in 23% of the patients (Table 3).\nClinical presentations were ASIA A (41%), followed by B (23%), C (19%) and D (17%); 9% of the patients had heterotopic ossification and 83% made rehabilitation. All the patients performed laboratory and image exams. The DVT occurrence was confirmed in 17% of the patients that made Doppler ultrasonography of bilateral lower limb.\nThe multivariate approach showed that the occurrence of DVT is bigger among individuals with homocysteinemia, with values between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 (odds ratio 25.67, P -value o 0.001) and among individuals with presence of Leiden factor V (odds ratio 51.51, P -value ¼ 0.013) (Table 4, Figures 2 and 3).\nThe investigation of the factors associated to the occurrence of thrombosis showed more frequency in individuals with paresis, that made big surgeries, with lower C and S protein dosage, increased\nhomocysteine (between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 ). Other factors associated to DVT occurrence were the presence of genetic polymorphism of Leiden factor V (Table 5). There were changes in the quantitative D-Dimer in 70.6% of the patients that showed DVT and 43.4% in those patients without DVT. Concerning the time of lesion, the median was 1.3 years among patients without DVT and median of 2.4 years among patients with DVT.\nIt was investigated the association between some characteristics observed and changes in D-Dimer (Table 5). Values of D-Dimer above the reference were found in 46% of the patients with paraplegia and 51.4% of the patients with tetraplegia, showing that there were no differences in the lesions ( P ¼ 0.607). There were no significant differences between D-Dimer greater than reference value and ASIA classification. There was association between changes in D-Dimer and fibrinogen ( P o 0.001), and the changes in D-Dimer in patients with values 4 400 are more frequent (72.3%) than between patients with normal dosages (26.7%). This evaluation was performed in the subgroup without DVT and the results were similar (not shown).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of DVT in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia, contrary that was thought in the study design. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nDVT is a multigenic and multifactorial disease; the interrelation of the risk factors lead to the thrombosis. 1 Besides, age is an isolated risk for DVT, mainly after 40 years. 11 In this study, 51% of the patients had age o 40 years (80.4% without DVT and 19.6% with DVT). Although the results not show statistical significance, the population was young, most men that can have association with the results, impacting in the low frequency of thrombosis, 17%. Experimental studies with fibrinogen scanning marked with I 125 showed presence of DVT in 100% of the patients with SI for acute SCI evaluated. 12\nThe majority of the studies in the literature evaluated patients with SI for acute SCI. 9,13–15 In this study, patients were analyzed with time lesion 4 1 year (median of 1.3 years among the patients without DVT and 2.4 years among patients with DVT). There are studies that show adaptation of many organic and functional systems in patients with SI. 15,16 Many factors can contribute to the higher occurrence of thrombosis in these patients. The permanent venous vasodilatation state in the lower limbs promotes lower speed of blood flow and stasis as constant risk factor. Experimental studies of spinal transection in mice showed increase in 1.5 times the diameter in femoral and saphenous veins. 15 Patients with SI present frequently dehydration and secondary increase of blood viscosity that can complicate the stasis and local hypoxia. 17\nThe higher the degree of muscle paralysis, the greater the tendency of slowing the blood flow, because of the loss of\n\n\nTable 1 Primer sequences and probes for Leiden Factor V\nAbbreviations: GPL, IgG phospholipid units; IQR, Interquartile range; MPL, IgM phospholipid units. Bold and italic values are statistically significant.\ncompressive effect of the muscle pumping, explaining higher occurrence of DVT in flaccid paralysis. 18 Boudaoud et al. (1997) simulated venoestase state in upper and lower limbs in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia, up to 6 months of SCI, compared with 10 normal volunteers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the fibrinolytic system and the risk of DVT after SCI. After venoestase upper limbs, the tissue plasminogen activator increased significantly in patients as in the control group, but no significant changes in the lower limbs. The prolonged stasis not allowed that the fibrinolytic response level in the lower limbs was the same as observed in the upper limbs. The dosage of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) did not change significantly after hypoxic state, although there was variation in dosages between individuals. In this study, 75% of patients with thrombosis had increased levels of D-Dimer but all patients had normal levels of thrombin–anti-thrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 þ 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by increased levels of D-Dimer without recovery of the fibrinolytic system suggests perennial antithrombotic treatment in therapeutic doses. 19\nIversen published a study in 2002 about hemostatic abnormalities and tetraplegia, concluding that circadian variations of several coagulation factors and fibrinolytic system are increased in patients with SI, due to a possible deregulation of the autonomic nervous system reflex, leading to a dysfunction between the variations central and peripheral circadian. 20 This could possibly reflect the deregulated autonomic nervous system, leading to a dysfunctional link between central and peripheral circadian oscillators.\nIn this study, 75% of patients with altered D-Dimer ( 4 500 ng ml 1 ), had no DVT (Table 3), confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography, which could suggest that changes in the fibrinolytic system may be a protective mechanism for patients outside the acute phase of SCI ( 4 1 year of SI).\n\n\nTable 4 Factors associated to DVT – multiple regression analysis\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI.\nLaboratory investigation for thrombophilia, including genetic tests, immunologic, coagulation and biochemistry exams, should not be requested in a systematic manner for SI patients by SCI. The conduct of this decision should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nThe adaptation of venous vascular system and changes in the fibrinolytic system need to be better understood and studied in SI patients by SCI for 4 1 year.\nPatients in this study are accompanied in an important National Rehabilitation Center, where all clinical support, mainly psychological and physical therapy, with complete guidance for patients and caregivers are provided. This might have impacted on the results and may not reflect the reality of other services.\n\n\nDATA ARCHIVING\nThere were no data to deposit.\n\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\nJC de Campos Guerra 1,2 , MA Moura˜o 3 , CN Franc ¸ a 4,5 , CDP da Rosa 6 and MN Burattini 1,7\n\n\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332 &amp; 2014 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved 1362-4393/14 www.nature.com/sc\n\n\nClinical suspicion of DVT Duplex Scan or Flebography SCI patients Clinical evaluation FLUXOGRAM Without suspicion of DVT Blood sample collection PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, D-Dimer, C, S and AT proteins, anticoagulant lupus Anti-cardiolipin antibody, homocystein\n\n\nOdds ratio 95% CI for odds ratio P- value LL UL\n\n\nFigure 2 Relation between Leiden Factor V and DVT.

Setting: Brazil, Sa˜o Paulo. Methods: Observational, prospective and cross-study. Eligible patients ( n ¼ 100) had SI by SCI, 4 18 years. The degree of motor and sensory lesion was evaluated based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Blood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, laboratory and biochemical analyses. Ultrasonography analyzes were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes.\nResults: The main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nConclusion: There is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI. Therefore, the conduct of the investigation for thrombophilia should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332; doi:10.1038/sc.2013.170; published online 11 February 2014\nKeywords: thromboembolism; spinal cord injury; Leiden factor V; hyperhomocysteinemia.\nThe venous thromboembolism (VT), that involves deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, is considered a common disease, with annual incidence of one to three cases per 1000 individuals. 1 There are many factors related to VT, including age, male gender, pelvic and lower limb fractures and spinal injury (SI). 2\nIt is well established in the literature the relation between DVT and SI. This incidence has increased in the last years, 3 ranging between 18 and 100%, depending on the diagnostic methods used, lesion time, associated risk factors and prophylactic treatment. 4 Sequelae from SI can affect the three components from classic Virchow triad, responsible for the genesis of VT: blood flow changes, endothelial cell damage and production of procoagulants, leading to hyper- coagulability state. Besides, pulmonary embolism is the serious complication and is the second leading death cause in these patients. The incidence of pulmonary embolism varies between 4.6 and 14% of the cases, being fatal between 1.7 and 4.7%. 5\nIn the venous system vascular, many changes can induce DVT, for example, partial or total paralysis of the muscles, affecting the blood flow due changes in the venous competence, causing the reduction in the capacity and distensibility of vascular bed and increase in the\nvenous flow resistance. These factors promote metabolic changes in blood vessels generating hypoxia associated to endothelial cell damage in the vessel wall, adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade activation and venous thrombosis. The hypercoagulability in the patients with SI is due to multiple mechanisms, including coagulation cascade activation, modifications in endothelial and other blood cells. 6\nMany genetic components constitute risk factors for VT. The majority affects the natural pathways of coagulation, mainly the C protein system. Resistance to activated C protein is the hyper- coagulability state more frequently associated with the pulmonary embolism development, caused by a Leiden factor V gene mutation (Arg 506 for Gly). 1 This mutation is found only in Caucasians, but the prevalence varies among the different countries. 7 The second most frequent mutation occurs in the not translated position 3 in the prothrombin gene (G 20210 A). 8 Less frequent genetic changes are the scarcity in the natural anticoagulant proteins (anti-thrombin, C and S protein). 1 Other acquired risk factors are sedentarism and tabagism, 9 lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, hyperhomo- cysteinemia and increase of coagulation factors, mainly factors I and VIII. 1\n1 Department of Pathology, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 2 Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 3 Clinics Hospital, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 4 Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 5 Santo Amaro University, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil; 6 Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil and 7 Department of Medicine, Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.

Patients ( n ¼ 100) were recruited from the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital USP— IMREA/Lucy Montoro Network, from January 2011 to April 2012. Eligible patients had SI by SCI, 4 18 years; the exclusion criteria were patients with SI for other reasons (not SCI), as cancer, lupus, multiple sclerosis, spinal compression by disc herniation, motor sequelae from stroke or subjects that presented clinical signs compatible with infection. The fluxogram is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\nVariables from the study\nThe variables investigated were: age, gender, race, type of SI (paraplegia or tetraplegia), injury time, etiology of SI and degree of motor and sensory lesion, using the American Spinal Injury Associa- tion (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), or Scale of Deficiency from ASIA, created in 1992, with review in 2011, and adopted worldwide in the specialized centers in the care subjects with SI. This classification is defined, according to modifications from Frankel, 10 as ASIA A (complete motor and sensory impairments), ASIA B (loss of motor function with sensitive function preserved, below the neurological level, including the sensitive sacral nerve S4–S5), ASIA C ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, presenting strength less than degree 3), ASIA D ( 4 50% of the major muscles below of the neurological lesion, showing strength greater than or equal degree 3) and ASIA E (normal sensory and motor functions). Summarily, the classifications ASIA A and B are complete motor lesion and ASIA C and D incomplete motor lesion.\nOther variables analyzed were VT evaluation by duplex scan ultrasonography, laboratory exams, prothrombin time, clottable fibrinogen, dosage of factor VIII, C protein of coagulation, antigen- free S protein, anti-thrombin, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardi- olipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, Leiden factor V, prothrombin mutation (factor II) and D-Dimer dosage.\n\n\nBlood sampling and exam analyses\nBlood samples were collected for coagulation exams, hemogram, real- time PCR and biochemical analyses. Plasma was freezed to 70 1 C for evaluating prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, quantitative D-Dimer, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, search for lupus anticoagulant. Serum was refrigerated to 4 1 C for searching of IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies and homocysteine. DNA was obtained from samples collected in EDTA tubes refrigerated to 4 1 C, for analyzing the presence of mutations in Leiden factor V and prothrombin (G20210 A).\n\n\nLaboratory exams\nThe analyzes of laboratory exams were performed in the Clinical Pathology Department from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for determining the International Normalized Ratio, fibrinogen, factor VIII dosage, C, S and anti-thrombin proteins, quantitative D-Dimer, search for lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA, homocysteine and genetic tests.\n\n\nReal-time PCR\nGenomic DNA was obtained from 200 ul of peripheral blood using the bioMe´rieux NucliSens easyMAG. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in order to investigate mutations in the prothrombin (G20210A) and Leiden factor V (G1691A) genes, using Taqman probes ABI7500 instrument and kits for allelic discrimination ABI Taqman (Applied Biosystem, San Diego, CA, USA). Primer sequences and probes are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nUltrasonography exams\nUltrasonography analyses were performed from deep and superficial venous systems of lower limbs (proximal and distal veins), using linear transducer of 7.5 MHz and Siemens equipment Sonoline G40 (Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA). Two-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed Doppler and Color Doppler flow mapping were employed. Appropriate probes were selected according to the depth of the vessels examined.

Veins were investigated in longitudinal and transversal views. Diagnostic criteria used for confirming or exclude DVT was based on compression test and the absence or presence of endoluminal material. The test was considered negative if the veins were totally compressible and without thrombus, positive when the veins were incompressible combined with the direct image of an endoluminal thrombus.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables are presented as n (%) and absolute frequencies and numerical variables are expressed as median (interquartile range). The investigation to the factors associated to the thrombosis occurrence was performed in two stages: simple analysis, using Pearson’s Chi-square, exact Fisher or Mann–Whitney tests for evaluating the association between the characteristics of interest and the occurrence of thrombosis and multiple analysis, using logistic regression models for verifying the influence of the variables of interest in the thrombosis occurrence. Statistical significance was set at a P -value of o 0.05. All analyses were made using the SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nThe trial protocol was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the institute on human experimentation and approval was obtained from the local ethics committee for analysis of research projects (1201/09). Informed consent was obtained from all partici- pants prior to inclusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe subjects ( n ¼ 100) were 72% men, 65% white race, 83% did rehabilitation, with a mean age of 39 years and a s.d. of 13.11 (range 20–76) years. Concerning the type of SI, 63% presented paraplegia and the most frequent etiologies were motor vehicle accident (35%), accidental fall (25%) and injury by firearms (17%). Other etiologies were observed in 23% of the patients (Table 3).\nClinical presentations were ASIA A (41%), followed by B (23%), C (19%) and D (17%); 9% of the patients had heterotopic ossification and 83% made rehabilitation. All the patients performed laboratory and image exams. The DVT occurrence was confirmed in 17% of the patients that made Doppler ultrasonography of bilateral lower limb.\nThe multivariate approach showed that the occurrence of DVT is bigger among individuals with homocysteinemia, with values between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 (odds ratio 25.67, P -value o 0.001) and among individuals with presence of Leiden factor V (odds ratio 51.51, P -value ¼ 0.013) (Table 4, Figures 2 and 3).\nThe investigation of the factors associated to the occurrence of thrombosis showed more frequency in individuals with paresis, that made big surgeries, with lower C and S protein dosage, increased\nhomocysteine (between 15 and 30 m mol l 1 ). Other factors associated to DVT occurrence were the presence of genetic polymorphism of Leiden factor V (Table 5). There were changes in the quantitative D-Dimer in 70.6% of the patients that showed DVT and 43.4% in those patients without DVT. Concerning the time of lesion, the median was 1.3 years among patients without DVT and median of 2.4 years among patients with DVT.\nIt was investigated the association between some characteristics observed and changes in D-Dimer (Table 5). Values of D-Dimer above the reference were found in 46% of the patients with paraplegia and 51.4% of the patients with tetraplegia, showing that there were no differences in the lesions ( P ¼ 0.607). There were no significant differences between D-Dimer greater than reference value and ASIA classification. There was association between changes in D-Dimer and fibrinogen ( P o 0.001), and the changes in D-Dimer in patients with values 4 400 are more frequent (72.3%) than between patients with normal dosages (26.7%). This evaluation was performed in the subgroup without DVT and the results were similar (not shown).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding of this study was the higher occurrence of DVT in patients with Leiden factor V and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no association between SI for DVT, VT and thrombophilia, contrary that was thought in the study design. Also, there was no relation between lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin.\nDVT is a multigenic and multifactorial disease; the interrelation of the risk factors lead to the thrombosis. 1 Besides, age is an isolated risk for DVT, mainly after 40 years. 11 In this study, 51% of the patients had age o 40 years (80.4% without DVT and 19.6% with DVT). Although the results not show statistical significance, the population was young, most men that can have association with the results, impacting in the low frequency of thrombosis, 17%. Experimental studies with fibrinogen scanning marked with I 125 showed presence of DVT in 100% of the patients with SI for acute SCI evaluated. 12\nThe majority of the studies in the literature evaluated patients with SI for acute SCI. 9,13–15 In this study, patients were analyzed with time lesion 4 1 year (median of 1.3 years among the patients without DVT and 2.4 years among patients with DVT). There are studies that show adaptation of many organic and functional systems in patients with SI. 15,16 Many factors can contribute to the higher occurrence of thrombosis in these patients. The permanent venous vasodilatation state in the lower limbs promotes lower speed of blood flow and stasis as constant risk factor. Experimental studies of spinal transection in mice showed increase in 1.5 times the diameter in femoral and saphenous veins. 15 Patients with SI present frequently dehydration and secondary increase of blood viscosity that can complicate the stasis and local hypoxia. 17\nThe higher the degree of muscle paralysis, the greater the tendency of slowing the blood flow, because of the loss of\n\n\nTable 1 Primer sequences and probes for Leiden Factor V\nAbbreviations: GPL, IgG phospholipid units; IQR, Interquartile range; MPL, IgM phospholipid units. Bold and italic values are statistically significant.\ncompressive effect of the muscle pumping, explaining higher occurrence of DVT in flaccid paralysis. 18 Boudaoud et al. (1997) simulated venoestase state in upper and lower limbs in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia, up to 6 months of SCI, compared with 10 normal volunteers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the fibrinolytic system and the risk of DVT after SCI. After venoestase upper limbs, the tissue plasminogen activator increased significantly in patients as in the control group, but no significant changes in the lower limbs. The prolonged stasis not allowed that the fibrinolytic response level in the lower limbs was the same as observed in the upper limbs. The dosage of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) did not change significantly after hypoxic state, although there was variation in dosages between individuals. In this study, 75% of patients with thrombosis had increased levels of D-Dimer but all patients had normal levels of thrombin–anti-thrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 þ 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by increased levels of D-Dimer without recovery of the fibrinolytic system suggests perennial antithrombotic treatment in therapeutic doses. 19\nIversen published a study in 2002 about hemostatic abnormalities and tetraplegia, concluding that circadian variations of several coagulation factors and fibrinolytic system are increased in patients with SI, due to a possible deregulation of the autonomic nervous system reflex, leading to a dysfunction between the variations central and peripheral circadian. 20 This could possibly reflect the deregulated autonomic nervous system, leading to a dysfunctional link between central and peripheral circadian oscillators.\nIn this study, 75% of patients with altered D-Dimer ( 4 500 ng ml 1 ), had no DVT (Table 3), confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography, which could suggest that changes in the fibrinolytic system may be a protective mechanism for patients outside the acute phase of SCI ( 4 1 year of SI).\n\n\nTable 4 Factors associated to DVT – multiple regression analysis\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an important difference in the incidence of DVT in patients with SI by acute and chronic SCI.\nLaboratory investigation for thrombophilia, including genetic tests, immunologic, coagulation and biochemistry exams, should not be requested in a systematic manner for SI patients by SCI. The conduct of this decision should be based on clinical factors, risk factors for DVT and family history of thrombosis.\nThe adaptation of venous vascular system and changes in the fibrinolytic system need to be better understood and studied in SI patients by SCI for 4 1 year.\nPatients in this study are accompanied in an important National Rehabilitation Center, where all clinical support, mainly psychological and physical therapy, with complete guidance for patients and caregivers are provided. This might have impacted on the results and may not reflect the reality of other services.\n\n\nDATA ARCHIVING\nThere were no data to deposit.\n\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\nJC de Campos Guerra 1,2 , MA Moura˜o 3 , CN Franc ¸ a 4,5 , CDP da Rosa 6 and MN Burattini 1,7\n\n\nSpinal Cord (2014) 52, 327–332 &amp; 2014 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved 1362-4393/14 www.nature.com/sc\n\n\nClinical suspicion of DVT Duplex Scan or Flebography SCI patients Clinical evaluation FLUXOGRAM Without suspicion of DVT Blood sample collection PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, D-Dimer, C, S and AT proteins, anticoagulant lupus Anti-cardiolipin antibody, homocystein\n\n\nOdds ratio 95% CI for odds ratio P- value LL UL\n\n\nFigure 2 Relation between Leiden Factor V and DVT.

(J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:2301–5) © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation\nThe natural history of patients with complex cardiac lesion and heterotaxy is poor. The 1-year mortality is ⬎ 85% for patients with asplenia and ⬎ 50% for patients with polysple- nia ( 1,2 ). The modified Fontan operation has been used to improve survival in patients with heterotaxy syndrome and functional single ventricle. Due to complex venous and situs anomalies, the technical aspects of constructing the path- ways for a modified Fontan connection are complicated. Frequently, conduits and baffles are necessary to effectively divert caval, hepatic, and pulmonary venous blood flows. Initial reports of the outcome of the modified Fontan operation for heterotaxy syndrome revealed early mortality of 13% to 80% ( 3– 6 ).\nSince these early reports, there have been numerous improvements in surgical and postoperative techniques. We sought to evaluate the early and late results of the modified Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\nVariables traditionally known to correlate with poor out- come were assessed. Current health status of survivors was obtained.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients. A total of 142 patients with heterotaxy syn- drome were identified in the Mayo Clinic Fontan data- base from 1975 through 2004. No patients with hetero- taxy syndrome who had a Fontan procedure were excluded. Hospital and outpatient records were ab- stracted for preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical and hemodynamic data. Additionally, all patients who were not known to be deceased were sent health status questionnaires. Current addresses and date of death were cross-referenced with Accurint, a locate-and- research database. Patients who did not return their questionnaires after the first mailing received 2 additional mailings and a reminder by telephone. The median age at Fontan procedure was 9 years (range: 2 to 35 years) with 82 (58%) being male.

Asplenia was diagnosed in 76 patients (54%) and polysplenia in 66 (46%) ( Table 1 ). Ambiguous abdominal situs was the most frequent type of visceral situs (76%). Levocardia (56%) was slightly more common than dextrocardia (42%). The majority of patients had a common atrioventricular valve (79%). The ventricular morphology was usually unbalanced, with 70% having non-left ventricular morphology. Anomalous pulmonary venous connections were present in 64% of patients. Abnormalities of the systemic venous connections also were common. Bilateral superior vena cavae (SVC) were found in 75 (53%) patients. Interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos or hemiazygos continuation to the SVC was present in 75 patients (54%). The hepatic veins entered the atrium separate from the IVC in 79 cases (57%).\nEras of operation. The 30-year study period was divided into 3 equal chronologic eras based on the date of the\nFontan operation. The early era, 1975 through 1984, included 30 patients. The majority of operations were performed during the middle era, 1985 through 1994, with 91 patients. An additional 21 patients had the operation in the most recent era, 1995 through 2004 ( Fig. 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference between eras in age at surgery, gender, or number of previous surgical palliations ( Table 2 ). Previous palliative procedures. For 22 patients (16%), the Fontan operation was their first surgical procedure. Seventy- nine patients (56%) had 1 previous palliative procedure, 30 (21%) had 2, and 11 (8%) had ⱖ 3 ( Table 3 ). Fontan connection. The types of Fontan connections that were used are listed in Table 4 . Only 6 patients had a fenestration, and all of those were performed in the recent era. Atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement was performed in 8 patients (6%) and repaired in 37 patients (26%) at the time of the Fontan procedure.\nStatistical analysis. We used the same independent vari- ables of interest that were used in previous outcome studies of the Fontan operation from the Mayo Clinic ( 3,4,7–9 ). Univariate assessment of the association of variables with mortality was performed using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Cumulative survival was estimated using the\n\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms\nKaplan-Meier method. Models were constructed with Cox proportional-hazard models using a stepwise elimination of the nonsignificant variables performed using a p value cut point to retain variables ⬍ 0.05. For all other comparisons, 2-tail p values of ⱕ 0.05 were taken as evidence of findings not attributable to chance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly mortality. Overall, 32 patients (23%) died within 30 days after operation or before hospital discharge. Early mortality decreased over time, from 50.0% in the early era to 16.5% in the middle era and 9.5% in the most recent era. Comparing the early era with both the middle (p ⬍ 0.001) and the recent eras (p ⫽ 0.003), there has been a significant decrease in early mortality. Comparing the middle era to the recent era, there is a trend toward decreased mortality, but it is not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.42). No early deaths occurred in 6 patients who had fenestration as part of the Fontan procedure (all performed in the most recent era). Univariate predictors of early mortality. The variables that correlated significantly with early mortality were a preoperative cardiothoracic ratio ⬎ 0.6, elevated systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure, prolonged bypass time, postoperative mean right atrial pressure ⬎ 20 mm Hg, and postoperative renal failure ( Table 5 ). Late mortality. Using a combined approach of chart review and Accurint searches, 29 late deaths were identified, ranging from 97 days to 20 years after operation. The cause of death was known in 19 cases. Five patients died after late reoperation, 4 with asplenia died from sepsis, 4 were sudden and presumed due to an arrhythmia, 3 were attributed to progressive myocardial failure, 1 to pulmonary hemorrhage, 1 to suicide, and 1 to a motor vehicle accident. Clinical or autopsy data could not be obtained for 10 of the 29 patients.\nHowever, accurate dates of death were available for all 29 patients.\nActuarial cumulative survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the early surgical era, early mortality was high (50%) and cumulative long-term survival was poor (33%, 33%, and 30% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively). Early- and long-term survival improved in the 2 more recent eras. Combining only the 2 most recent eras, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 72%, 63%, and 60%, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Univariate predictors of late mortality. Only bypass time ⬎ 120 min and AV valve replacement were predictive of late mortality, with odds ratios of 5.59 and 6.24, respec- tively (p ⬍ 0.05).\nCurrent health and functional status. Excluding the 32 early deaths and the 29 late deaths, there were 81 (57%) late survivors available to assess current health and functional status. Follow-up data were obtained for 41 (51%) of these patients by written questionnaire or by return clinic visit during the data acquisition portion of this study. For these 41 patients, the median follow-up interval after the Fontan operation was 15 years (range 1 to 23 years). Of these patients, 80% reported having no or mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity, 18% had moderate symptoms with less than normal physical activity, and 3% had symp- toms at rest. Specific signs and symptoms consisted of easy fatigue (49%), palpitations (39%), shortness of breath (32%), persistent cyanosis (24%), and chest pain (20%). Despite this optimistic self-reported current health status, these 41 patients had numerous medical complications. Nineteen patients (46%) reported a history of an arrhythmia and 9 (22%) required placement of a permanent pacemaker. A thromboembolic event occurred in 5 patients (12%). Protein-losing enteropathy was diagnosed in 1 patient (2%). One patient had cardiac transplantation (lateral tunnel), 1 was currently listed for transplant (right ventricular outflow tract to pulmonary artery), and 1 was being evaluated for transplantation (Kawashima-type connection).\nMost (95%) of these 41 patients were taking ⱖ 1 medication. The most frequent medications included angiotension- converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor block- ers (73%), digoxin (66%), daily antibiotic prophylaxis (53%), aspirin (54%), warfarin (43%), beta-blocker (24%), and aldac- tone (18%). Of the patients with asplenia, 81% were taking daily antibiotic prophylaxis.\nMost survivors (78%) were employed or attending formal education programs at the time of this review. Of those employed, 50% were working full time. Part-time employ-\nFigure 1. Number of Fontan operations performed at Mayo Clinic for heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 2. Demographics Based on Era of Operation\nment was by choice in 28% of those employed, and 22% were limited to part-time employment by their current cardiac status.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nBefore the concept of total right heart bypass to treat tricuspid atresia, patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle were only candidates for palliative proce- dures to either augment or restrict pulmonary blood flow. Even after the description of the Fontan operation, the criteria developed by Choussat et al. ( 10 ) essentially ex- cluded patients with heterotaxy syndrome from having a Fontan operation. However, clinicians expanded the indi- cations and in the mid-1970s the Fontan operation was used to treat patients with all forms of complex functional single ventricle, including patients with heterotaxy syndrome. Unfortunately the mortality for patients with heterotaxy who had a Fontan operation was high. Humes et al. ( 4 ) reported an early mortality of 43%. In early outcome series after the Fontan operation, heterotaxy frequently was one variable that predicted poor outcome ( 7 ). Investigators in the 1980s recognized that heterotaxy per se may not have been the most critical variable that predicted high mortality. Rather, the more important fac- tors relating to mortality were poor ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, and complex surgical repair with pro- longed bypass time ( 7 ). Investigators believed that the Fontan operation could be successful for patients with heterotaxy if the operation was performed before develop- ment of ventricular dysfunction and/or significant AV valve insufficiency. Surgical techniques improved over time, per- mitting shorter duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.\nIn the present study, several recognized risk factors for early mortality (AV valve repair, decreased ventricular sys-\ntolic function, and elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance) were not predictive of outcome. Similar experience has been reported in other recent series ( 3,8,11,12 ). This may be due to several factors, such as better patient selection, staged repair, advancement of surgical techniques, and improved postoperative management. Despite these encouraging re- sults, children with functional single ventricle and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections have a 53% mortality at the time of initial palliative operation, and the mortality for the subsequent cavopulmonary anastomosis also is substantial (38%) ( 13 ). Therefore, many “high-risk” patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle may never reach the age to have a Fontan operation ( 14,15 ). Atrioventricular valve repair or replacement previously has been associated with early mortality ( 3 ). Therefore, clinical practice has evolved and led to AV valve repair/ replacement before completion of the Fontan connection. In the current cohort, AV valve repair or replacement was not predictive of early mortality, which may be an important factor resulting in improved early mortality.\nFigure 2. Kaplan-Meier curve depicting the survival after the Fontan procedure for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 3. Prior Palliative Procedures\n\n\nTable 4. Type of Fontan Connection\n\n\nTable 5. Variables Associated With Early Mortality\nThe types of Fontan connection have evolved over the past 30 years. Also, because of the complex anatomy associated with heterotaxy the methods of accomplishing the Fontan connec- tions are quite varied among patients with heterotaxy. This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the type of Fontan procedure and outcome.\nIn the recent era (1995 to 2004), early mortality after Fontan decreased to 9.5% but remained greater than the early mortality for patients with double-inlet left ventricle and tricuspid atresia (3% and 2%, respectively) during a similar time period at the Mayo Clinic ( 8,9 ). Because early mortality for patients with heterotaxy syndrome remains substantially higher than for patients with other forms of functional single ventricle, one may propose that all patients with heterotaxy syndrome who have a Fontan operation should also have a fenestration performed. Currently, at our center, patients with heterotaxy syndrome have Fontan completion via a fenestrated intra-atrial Gore-Tex tube conduit. The long-term benefits of this technique merit further analysis.\nIt has been argued that the improvements in the care and outcome of patients with functional single ventricle may not translate into improved results for heterotaxy patients. It was thought that their numerous associated anatomic and physiologic maladies would negate these advances. Al- though results have not reached the level seen in double- inlet left ventricle or tricuspid atresia, survival for heterotaxy patients has clearly improved. It is also encouraging to note that of the 76 patients with asplenia, only 4 died late of clinical sepsis. We were unable to ascertain antibiotic prophy- laxis status in these 4 patients, however, in the surveyed patients with asplenia, 19% were not taking antibiotic prophy- laxis, which may be a contributing risk factor.\nRhythm disturbances account for a substantial degree of morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias were reported in 46% of the patients with heterotaxy compared with 57% of patients with double-inlet left ventricle ( 8 ). Because patients with heterotaxy undergo extensive intra-atrial baffling pro- cedures, one might anticipate a higher incidence of arrhyth- mia than for patients having less extensive atrial surgery. We did not find this to be true. However, the patients with heterotaxy had a shorter follow-up interval (4 vs.12 years) than the patients with double-inlet left ventricle. Longer follow-up may demonstrate that patients with heterotaxy have an even higher risk of sudden death and arrhythmias than patients with less complex forms of functional single ventricle. Thus, a detailed and aggressive approach to surveillance and therapy for arrhythmias is essential.\nSurvival after the Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy has improved despite the anatomic complexity of their cardiac disease. Many factors have contributed to the improved survival. In our assessment of long-term survival many of these factors were subtle and evolved simulta- neously. This made it difficult in the retrospective statistical analysis to delineate specific factors that affect outcome. It is\nmost likely that improved patient selection, staging of surgical repair, younger age at time of Fontan operation, refinements in surgical techniques, and advancement of postoperative care have all contributed to the improved results.\nConclusions. Over the past 30 years, there has been a significant improvement in the early outcome for patients with heterotaxy syndrome after a modified Fontan opera- tion. However, mortality and morbidity remain substantial. Discovery of innovative treatment methods is essential. Furthermore, meticulous long-term medical management at centers specializing in the care of congenital heart disease is mandatory.\nReprint requests and correspondence: Dr. Frank Cetta, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

There was no statistically significant difference between eras in age at surgery, gender, or number of previous surgical palliations ( Table 2 ). Previous palliative procedures. For 22 patients (16%), the Fontan operation was their first surgical procedure. Seventy- nine patients (56%) had 1 previous palliative procedure, 30 (21%) had 2, and 11 (8%) had ⱖ 3 ( Table 3 ). Fontan connection. The types of Fontan connections that were used are listed in Table 4 . Only 6 patients had a fenestration, and all of those were performed in the recent era. Atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement was performed in 8 patients (6%) and repaired in 37 patients (26%) at the time of the Fontan procedure.\nStatistical analysis. We used the same independent vari- ables of interest that were used in previous outcome studies of the Fontan operation from the Mayo Clinic ( 3,4,7–9 ). Univariate assessment of the association of variables with mortality was performed using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Cumulative survival was estimated using the\n\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms\nKaplan-Meier method. Models were constructed with Cox proportional-hazard models using a stepwise elimination of the nonsignificant variables performed using a p value cut point to retain variables ⬍ 0.05. For all other comparisons, 2-tail p values of ⱕ 0.05 were taken as evidence of findings not attributable to chance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly mortality. Overall, 32 patients (23%) died within 30 days after operation or before hospital discharge. Early mortality decreased over time, from 50.0% in the early era to 16.5% in the middle era and 9.5% in the most recent era. Comparing the early era with both the middle (p ⬍ 0.001) and the recent eras (p ⫽ 0.003), there has been a significant decrease in early mortality. Comparing the middle era to the recent era, there is a trend toward decreased mortality, but it is not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.42). No early deaths occurred in 6 patients who had fenestration as part of the Fontan procedure (all performed in the most recent era). Univariate predictors of early mortality. The variables that correlated significantly with early mortality were a preoperative cardiothoracic ratio ⬎ 0.6, elevated systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure, prolonged bypass time, postoperative mean right atrial pressure ⬎ 20 mm Hg, and postoperative renal failure ( Table 5 ). Late mortality. Using a combined approach of chart review and Accurint searches, 29 late deaths were identified, ranging from 97 days to 20 years after operation. The cause of death was known in 19 cases. Five patients died after late reoperation, 4 with asplenia died from sepsis, 4 were sudden and presumed due to an arrhythmia, 3 were attributed to progressive myocardial failure, 1 to pulmonary hemorrhage, 1 to suicide, and 1 to a motor vehicle accident. Clinical or autopsy data could not be obtained for 10 of the 29 patients.\nHowever, accurate dates of death were available for all 29 patients.\nActuarial cumulative survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the early surgical era, early mortality was high (50%) and cumulative long-term survival was poor (33%, 33%, and 30% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively). Early- and long-term survival improved in the 2 more recent eras. Combining only the 2 most recent eras, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 72%, 63%, and 60%, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Univariate predictors of late mortality. Only bypass time ⬎ 120 min and AV valve replacement were predictive of late mortality, with odds ratios of 5.59 and 6.24, respec- tively (p ⬍ 0.05).\nCurrent health and functional status. Excluding the 32 early deaths and the 29 late deaths, there were 81 (57%) late survivors available to assess current health and functional status. Follow-up data were obtained for 41 (51%) of these patients by written questionnaire or by return clinic visit during the data acquisition portion of this study. For these 41 patients, the median follow-up interval after the Fontan operation was 15 years (range 1 to 23 years). Of these patients, 80% reported having no or mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity, 18% had moderate symptoms with less than normal physical activity, and 3% had symp- toms at rest. Specific signs and symptoms consisted of easy fatigue (49%), palpitations (39%), shortness of breath (32%), persistent cyanosis (24%), and chest pain (20%). Despite this optimistic self-reported current health status, these 41 patients had numerous medical complications. Nineteen patients (46%) reported a history of an arrhythmia and 9 (22%) required placement of a permanent pacemaker. A thromboembolic event occurred in 5 patients (12%). Protein-losing enteropathy was diagnosed in 1 patient (2%). One patient had cardiac transplantation (lateral tunnel), 1 was currently listed for transplant (right ventricular outflow tract to pulmonary artery), and 1 was being evaluated for transplantation (Kawashima-type connection).\nMost (95%) of these 41 patients were taking ⱖ 1 medication. The most frequent medications included angiotension- converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor block- ers (73%), digoxin (66%), daily antibiotic prophylaxis (53%), aspirin (54%), warfarin (43%), beta-blocker (24%), and aldac- tone (18%). Of the patients with asplenia, 81% were taking daily antibiotic prophylaxis.\nMost survivors (78%) were employed or attending formal education programs at the time of this review. Of those employed, 50% were working full time. Part-time employ-\nFigure 1. Number of Fontan operations performed at Mayo Clinic for heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 2. Demographics Based on Era of Operation\nment was by choice in 28% of those employed, and 22% were limited to part-time employment by their current cardiac status.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nBefore the concept of total right heart bypass to treat tricuspid atresia, patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle were only candidates for palliative proce- dures to either augment or restrict pulmonary blood flow. Even after the description of the Fontan operation, the criteria developed by Choussat et al. ( 10 ) essentially ex- cluded patients with heterotaxy syndrome from having a Fontan operation. However, clinicians expanded the indi- cations and in the mid-1970s the Fontan operation was used to treat patients with all forms of complex functional single ventricle, including patients with heterotaxy syndrome. Unfortunately the mortality for patients with heterotaxy who had a Fontan operation was high. Humes et al. ( 4 ) reported an early mortality of 43%. In early outcome series after the Fontan operation, heterotaxy frequently was one variable that predicted poor outcome ( 7 ). Investigators in the 1980s recognized that heterotaxy per se may not have been the most critical variable that predicted high mortality. Rather, the more important fac- tors relating to mortality were poor ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, and complex surgical repair with pro- longed bypass time ( 7 ). Investigators believed that the Fontan operation could be successful for patients with heterotaxy if the operation was performed before develop- ment of ventricular dysfunction and/or significant AV valve insufficiency. Surgical techniques improved over time, per- mitting shorter duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.\nIn the present study, several recognized risk factors for early mortality (AV valve repair, decreased ventricular sys-\ntolic function, and elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance) were not predictive of outcome. Similar experience has been reported in other recent series ( 3,8,11,12 ). This may be due to several factors, such as better patient selection, staged repair, advancement of surgical techniques, and improved postoperative management. Despite these encouraging re- sults, children with functional single ventricle and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections have a 53% mortality at the time of initial palliative operation, and the mortality for the subsequent cavopulmonary anastomosis also is substantial (38%) ( 13 ). Therefore, many “high-risk” patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle may never reach the age to have a Fontan operation ( 14,15 ). Atrioventricular valve repair or replacement previously has been associated with early mortality ( 3 ). Therefore, clinical practice has evolved and led to AV valve repair/ replacement before completion of the Fontan connection. In the current cohort, AV valve repair or replacement was not predictive of early mortality, which may be an important factor resulting in improved early mortality.\nFigure 2. Kaplan-Meier curve depicting the survival after the Fontan procedure for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 3. Prior Palliative Procedures\n\n\nTable 4. Type of Fontan Connection\n\n\nTable 5. Variables Associated With Early Mortality\nThe types of Fontan connection have evolved over the past 30 years. Also, because of the complex anatomy associated with heterotaxy the methods of accomplishing the Fontan connec- tions are quite varied among patients with heterotaxy. This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the type of Fontan procedure and outcome.\nIn the recent era (1995 to 2004), early mortality after Fontan decreased to 9.5% but remained greater than the early mortality for patients with double-inlet left ventricle and tricuspid atresia (3% and 2%, respectively) during a similar time period at the Mayo Clinic ( 8,9 ). Because early mortality for patients with heterotaxy syndrome remains substantially higher than for patients with other forms of functional single ventricle, one may propose that all patients with heterotaxy syndrome who have a Fontan operation should also have a fenestration performed. Currently, at our center, patients with heterotaxy syndrome have Fontan completion via a fenestrated intra-atrial Gore-Tex tube conduit. The long-term benefits of this technique merit further analysis.\nIt has been argued that the improvements in the care and outcome of patients with functional single ventricle may not translate into improved results for heterotaxy patients. It was thought that their numerous associated anatomic and physiologic maladies would negate these advances. Al- though results have not reached the level seen in double- inlet left ventricle or tricuspid atresia, survival for heterotaxy patients has clearly improved. It is also encouraging to note that of the 76 patients with asplenia, only 4 died late of clinical sepsis. We were unable to ascertain antibiotic prophy- laxis status in these 4 patients, however, in the surveyed patients with asplenia, 19% were not taking antibiotic prophy- laxis, which may be a contributing risk factor.\nRhythm disturbances account for a substantial degree of morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias were reported in 46% of the patients with heterotaxy compared with 57% of patients with double-inlet left ventricle ( 8 ). Because patients with heterotaxy undergo extensive intra-atrial baffling pro- cedures, one might anticipate a higher incidence of arrhyth- mia than for patients having less extensive atrial surgery. We did not find this to be true. However, the patients with heterotaxy had a shorter follow-up interval (4 vs.12 years) than the patients with double-inlet left ventricle. Longer follow-up may demonstrate that patients with heterotaxy have an even higher risk of sudden death and arrhythmias than patients with less complex forms of functional single ventricle. Thus, a detailed and aggressive approach to surveillance and therapy for arrhythmias is essential.\nSurvival after the Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy has improved despite the anatomic complexity of their cardiac disease. Many factors have contributed to the improved survival. In our assessment of long-term survival many of these factors were subtle and evolved simulta- neously. This made it difficult in the retrospective statistical analysis to delineate specific factors that affect outcome. It is\nmost likely that improved patient selection, staging of surgical repair, younger age at time of Fontan operation, refinements in surgical techniques, and advancement of postoperative care have all contributed to the improved results.\nConclusions. Over the past 30 years, there has been a significant improvement in the early outcome for patients with heterotaxy syndrome after a modified Fontan opera- tion. However, mortality and morbidity remain substantial. Discovery of innovative treatment methods is essential. Furthermore, meticulous long-term medical management at centers specializing in the care of congenital heart disease is mandatory.\nReprint requests and correspondence: Dr. Frank Cetta, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

Hodge, MS,§ Frank Cetta, MD*†\nRochester, Minnesota\nOBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate the early and late results of the modified Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy syndrome, assess variables traditionally known to correlate with poor outcome, and assess current health status of survivors after the Fontan procedure.\nBACKGROUND The natural history of unoperated cardiac lesions in heterotaxy is known to be poor. Therefore, the Fontan operation has been proposed to improve survival.\nMETHODS Patients with heterotaxy were identified from the Mayo Clinic Fontan database. Hospital and outpatient records were abstracted for preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical and hemodynamic data. All patients not known to be deceased were sent health status questionnaires.\nRESULTS A total of 142 patients with heterotaxy syndrome had a modified Fontan operation. Asplenia was present in 76 patients (54%). Median age at operation was 9 years (range 2 to 35 years). Median follow-up was 4 years (range 0 to 23 years). There were a total of 61 deaths (43%), with 32 (23%) within 30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the modern era (1995 to 2004) early mortality was 10%. Of the 81 survivors, questionnaires were available from 41 (51%). Eighty percent reported having no or mild symptoms. However, 19 (46%) had arrhythmias, 5 (12%) had a thromboembolic event, and 1 (2%) developed protein-losing enteropathy.\nCONCLUSIONS Early survival has improved for heterotaxy patients after the Fontan operation; however, late morbidity and mortality remain substantial. Better strategies for long-term treatment of this high-risk group need to be identified. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:2301–5) © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation\nThe natural history of patients with complex cardiac lesion and heterotaxy is poor. The 1-year mortality is ⬎ 85% for patients with asplenia and ⬎ 50% for patients with polysple- nia ( 1,2 ). The modified Fontan operation has been used to improve survival in patients with heterotaxy syndrome and functional single ventricle. Due to complex venous and situs anomalies, the technical aspects of constructing the path- ways for a modified Fontan connection are complicated. Frequently, conduits and baffles are necessary to effectively divert caval, hepatic, and pulmonary venous blood flows. Initial reports of the outcome of the modified Fontan operation for heterotaxy syndrome revealed early mortality of 13% to 80% ( 3– 6 ).\nSince these early reports, there have been numerous improvements in surgical and postoperative techniques. We sought to evaluate the early and late results of the modified Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\nVariables traditionally known to correlate with poor out- come were assessed. Current health status of survivors was obtained.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients. A total of 142 patients with heterotaxy syn- drome were identified in the Mayo Clinic Fontan data- base from 1975 through 2004. No patients with hetero- taxy syndrome who had a Fontan procedure were excluded. Hospital and outpatient records were ab- stracted for preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical and hemodynamic data. Additionally, all patients who were not known to be deceased were sent health status questionnaires. Current addresses and date of death were cross-referenced with Accurint, a locate-and- research database. Patients who did not return their questionnaires after the first mailing received 2 additional mailings and a reminder by telephone. The median age at Fontan procedure was 9 years (range: 2 to 35 years) with 82 (58%) being male. Median follow-up was 4.5 years; the longest was 23 years.\nFrom the Divisions of *Pediatric Cardiology, †Cardiovascular Diseases and Internal Medicine, ‡Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, and §Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.

Asplenia was diagnosed in 76 patients (54%) and polysplenia in 66 (46%) ( Table 1 ). Ambiguous abdominal situs was the most frequent type of visceral situs (76%). Levocardia (56%) was slightly more common than dextrocardia (42%). The majority of patients had a common atrioventricular valve (79%). The ventricular morphology was usually unbalanced, with 70% having non-left ventricular morphology. Anomalous pulmonary venous connections were present in 64% of patients. Abnormalities of the systemic venous connections also were common. Bilateral superior vena cavae (SVC) were found in 75 (53%) patients. Interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos or hemiazygos continuation to the SVC was present in 75 patients (54%). The hepatic veins entered the atrium separate from the IVC in 79 cases (57%).\nEras of operation. The 30-year study period was divided into 3 equal chronologic eras based on the date of the\nFontan operation. The early era, 1975 through 1984, included 30 patients. The majority of operations were performed during the middle era, 1985 through 1994, with 91 patients. An additional 21 patients had the operation in the most recent era, 1995 through 2004 ( Fig. 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference between eras in age at surgery, gender, or number of previous surgical palliations ( Table 2 ). Previous palliative procedures. For 22 patients (16%), the Fontan operation was their first surgical procedure. Seventy- nine patients (56%) had 1 previous palliative procedure, 30 (21%) had 2, and 11 (8%) had ⱖ 3 ( Table 3 ). Fontan connection. The types of Fontan connections that were used are listed in Table 4 . Only 6 patients had a fenestration, and all of those were performed in the recent era. Atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement was performed in 8 patients (6%) and repaired in 37 patients (26%) at the time of the Fontan procedure.\nStatistical analysis. We used the same independent vari- ables of interest that were used in previous outcome studies of the Fontan operation from the Mayo Clinic ( 3,4,7–9 ). Univariate assessment of the association of variables with mortality was performed using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Cumulative survival was estimated using the\n\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms\nKaplan-Meier method. Models were constructed with Cox proportional-hazard models using a stepwise elimination of the nonsignificant variables performed using a p value cut point to retain variables ⬍ 0.05. For all other comparisons, 2-tail p values of ⱕ 0.05 were taken as evidence of findings not attributable to chance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly mortality. Overall, 32 patients (23%) died within 30 days after operation or before hospital discharge. Early mortality decreased over time, from 50.0% in the early era to 16.5% in the middle era and 9.5% in the most recent era. Comparing the early era with both the middle (p ⬍ 0.001) and the recent eras (p ⫽ 0.003), there has been a significant decrease in early mortality. Comparing the middle era to the recent era, there is a trend toward decreased mortality, but it is not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.42). No early deaths occurred in 6 patients who had fenestration as part of the Fontan procedure (all performed in the most recent era). Univariate predictors of early mortality. The variables that correlated significantly with early mortality were a preoperative cardiothoracic ratio ⬎ 0.6, elevated systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure, prolonged bypass time, postoperative mean right atrial pressure ⬎ 20 mm Hg, and postoperative renal failure ( Table 5 ). Late mortality. Using a combined approach of chart review and Accurint searches, 29 late deaths were identified, ranging from 97 days to 20 years after operation. The cause of death was known in 19 cases. Five patients died after late reoperation, 4 with asplenia died from sepsis, 4 were sudden and presumed due to an arrhythmia, 3 were attributed to progressive myocardial failure, 1 to pulmonary hemorrhage, 1 to suicide, and 1 to a motor vehicle accident. Clinical or autopsy data could not be obtained for 10 of the 29 patients.\nHowever, accurate dates of death were available for all 29 patients.\nActuarial cumulative survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the early surgical era, early mortality was high (50%) and cumulative long-term survival was poor (33%, 33%, and 30% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively). Early- and long-term survival improved in the 2 more recent eras. Combining only the 2 most recent eras, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 72%, 63%, and 60%, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Univariate predictors of late mortality. Only bypass time ⬎ 120 min and AV valve replacement were predictive of late mortality, with odds ratios of 5.59 and 6.24, respec- tively (p ⬍ 0.05).\nCurrent health and functional status. Excluding the 32 early deaths and the 29 late deaths, there were 81 (57%) late survivors available to assess current health and functional status. Follow-up data were obtained for 41 (51%) of these patients by written questionnaire or by return clinic visit during the data acquisition portion of this study. For these 41 patients, the median follow-up interval after the Fontan operation was 15 years (range 1 to 23 years). Of these patients, 80% reported having no or mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity, 18% had moderate symptoms with less than normal physical activity, and 3% had symp- toms at rest. Specific signs and symptoms consisted of easy fatigue (49%), palpitations (39%), shortness of breath (32%), persistent cyanosis (24%), and chest pain (20%). Despite this optimistic self-reported current health status, these 41 patients had numerous medical complications. Nineteen patients (46%) reported a history of an arrhythmia and 9 (22%) required placement of a permanent pacemaker. A thromboembolic event occurred in 5 patients (12%). Protein-losing enteropathy was diagnosed in 1 patient (2%). One patient had cardiac transplantation (lateral tunnel), 1 was currently listed for transplant (right ventricular outflow tract to pulmonary artery), and 1 was being evaluated for transplantation (Kawashima-type connection).\nMost (95%) of these 41 patients were taking ⱖ 1 medication. The most frequent medications included angiotension- converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor block- ers (73%), digoxin (66%), daily antibiotic prophylaxis (53%), aspirin (54%), warfarin (43%), beta-blocker (24%), and aldac- tone (18%). Of the patients with asplenia, 81% were taking daily antibiotic prophylaxis.\nMost survivors (78%) were employed or attending formal education programs at the time of this review. Of those employed, 50% were working full time. Part-time employ-\nFigure 1. Number of Fontan operations performed at Mayo Clinic for heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 2.

Even after the description of the Fontan operation, the criteria developed by Choussat et al. ( 10 ) essentially ex- cluded patients with heterotaxy syndrome from having a Fontan operation. However, clinicians expanded the indi- cations and in the mid-1970s the Fontan operation was used to treat patients with all forms of complex functional single ventricle, including patients with heterotaxy syndrome. Unfortunately the mortality for patients with heterotaxy who had a Fontan operation was high. Humes et al. ( 4 ) reported an early mortality of 43%. In early outcome series after the Fontan operation, heterotaxy frequently was one variable that predicted poor outcome ( 7 ). Investigators in the 1980s recognized that heterotaxy per se may not have been the most critical variable that predicted high mortality. Rather, the more important fac- tors relating to mortality were poor ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, and complex surgical repair with pro- longed bypass time ( 7 ). Investigators believed that the Fontan operation could be successful for patients with heterotaxy if the operation was performed before develop- ment of ventricular dysfunction and/or significant AV valve insufficiency. Surgical techniques improved over time, per- mitting shorter duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.\nIn the present study, several recognized risk factors for early mortality (AV valve repair, decreased ventricular sys-\ntolic function, and elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance) were not predictive of outcome. Similar experience has been reported in other recent series ( 3,8,11,12 ). This may be due to several factors, such as better patient selection, staged repair, advancement of surgical techniques, and improved postoperative management. Despite these encouraging re- sults, children with functional single ventricle and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections have a 53% mortality at the time of initial palliative operation, and the mortality for the subsequent cavopulmonary anastomosis also is substantial (38%) ( 13 ). Therefore, many “high-risk” patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle may never reach the age to have a Fontan operation ( 14,15 ). Atrioventricular valve repair or replacement previously has been associated with early mortality ( 3 ). Therefore, clinical practice has evolved and led to AV valve repair/ replacement before completion of the Fontan connection. In the current cohort, AV valve repair or replacement was not predictive of early mortality, which may be an important factor resulting in improved early mortality.\nFigure 2. Kaplan-Meier curve depicting the survival after the Fontan procedure for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 3. Prior Palliative Procedures\n\n\nTable 4. Type of Fontan Connection\n\n\nTable 5. Variables Associated With Early Mortality\nThe types of Fontan connection have evolved over the past 30 years. Also, because of the complex anatomy associated with heterotaxy the methods of accomplishing the Fontan connec- tions are quite varied among patients with heterotaxy. This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the type of Fontan procedure and outcome.\nIn the recent era (1995 to 2004), early mortality after Fontan decreased to 9.5% but remained greater than the early mortality for patients with double-inlet left ventricle and tricuspid atresia (3% and 2%, respectively) during a similar time period at the Mayo Clinic ( 8,9 ). Because early mortality for patients with heterotaxy syndrome remains substantially higher than for patients with other forms of functional single ventricle, one may propose that all patients with heterotaxy syndrome who have a Fontan operation should also have a fenestration performed. Currently, at our center, patients with heterotaxy syndrome have Fontan completion via a fenestrated intra-atrial Gore-Tex tube conduit. The long-term benefits of this technique merit further analysis.\nIt has been argued that the improvements in the care and outcome of patients with functional single ventricle may not translate into improved results for heterotaxy patients. It was thought that their numerous associated anatomic and physiologic maladies would negate these advances. Al- though results have not reached the level seen in double- inlet left ventricle or tricuspid atresia, survival for heterotaxy patients has clearly improved. It is also encouraging to note that of the 76 patients with asplenia, only 4 died late of clinical sepsis. We were unable to ascertain antibiotic prophy- laxis status in these 4 patients, however, in the surveyed patients with asplenia, 19% were not taking antibiotic prophy- laxis, which may be a contributing risk factor.\nRhythm disturbances account for a substantial degree of morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias were reported in 46% of the patients with heterotaxy compared with 57% of patients with double-inlet left ventricle ( 8 ). Because patients with heterotaxy undergo extensive intra-atrial baffling pro- cedures, one might anticipate a higher incidence of arrhyth- mia than for patients having less extensive atrial surgery. We did not find this to be true. However, the patients with heterotaxy had a shorter follow-up interval (4 vs.12 years) than the patients with double-inlet left ventricle. Longer follow-up may demonstrate that patients with heterotaxy have an even higher risk of sudden death and arrhythmias than patients with less complex forms of functional single ventricle. Thus, a detailed and aggressive approach to surveillance and therapy for arrhythmias is essential.\nSurvival after the Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy has improved despite the anatomic complexity of their cardiac disease. Many factors have contributed to the improved survival. In our assessment of long-term survival many of these factors were subtle and evolved simulta- neously. This made it difficult in the retrospective statistical analysis to delineate specific factors that affect outcome. It is\nmost likely that improved patient selection, staging of surgical repair, younger age at time of Fontan operation, refinements in surgical techniques, and advancement of postoperative care have all contributed to the improved results.\nConclusions. Over the past 30 years, there has been a significant improvement in the early outcome for patients with heterotaxy syndrome after a modified Fontan opera- tion. However, mortality and morbidity remain substantial. Discovery of innovative treatment methods is essential. Furthermore, meticulous long-term medical management at centers specializing in the care of congenital heart disease is mandatory.\nReprint requests and correspondence: Dr. Frank Cetta, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

Bartz, MD,* David J. Driscoll, MD,*† Joseph A. Dearani, MD,‡ Francisco J. Puga, MD,‡ Gordon K. Danielson, MD,‡ Patrick W. O’Leary, MD,*\nMichael G. Earing, MD,* Carole A. Warnes, MD,*† David O. Hodge, MS,§ Frank Cetta, MD*†\nRochester, Minnesota\nOBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate the early and late results of the modified Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy syndrome, assess variables traditionally known to correlate with poor outcome, and assess current health status of survivors after the Fontan procedure.\nBACKGROUND The natural history of unoperated cardiac lesions in heterotaxy is known to be poor. Therefore, the Fontan operation has been proposed to improve survival.\nMETHODS Patients with heterotaxy were identified from the Mayo Clinic Fontan database. Hospital and outpatient records were abstracted for preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical and hemodynamic data. All patients not known to be deceased were sent health status questionnaires.\nRESULTS A total of 142 patients with heterotaxy syndrome had a modified Fontan operation. Asplenia was present in 76 patients (54%). Median age at operation was 9 years (range 2 to 35 years). Median follow-up was 4 years (range 0 to 23 years). There were a total of 61 deaths (43%), with 32 (23%) within 30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the modern era (1995 to 2004) early mortality was 10%. Of the 81 survivors, questionnaires were available from 41 (51%). Eighty percent reported having no or mild symptoms. However, 19 (46%) had arrhythmias, 5 (12%) had a thromboembolic event, and 1 (2%) developed protein-losing enteropathy.\nCONCLUSIONS Early survival has improved for heterotaxy patients after the Fontan operation; however, late morbidity and mortality remain substantial. Better strategies for long-term treatment of this high-risk group need to be identified. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:2301–5) © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation\nThe natural history of patients with complex cardiac lesion and heterotaxy is poor. The 1-year mortality is ⬎ 85% for patients with asplenia and ⬎ 50% for patients with polysple- nia ( 1,2 ). The modified Fontan operation has been used to improve survival in patients with heterotaxy syndrome and functional single ventricle. Due to complex venous and situs anomalies, the technical aspects of constructing the path- ways for a modified Fontan connection are complicated. Frequently, conduits and baffles are necessary to effectively divert caval, hepatic, and pulmonary venous blood flows. Initial reports of the outcome of the modified Fontan operation for heterotaxy syndrome revealed early mortality of 13% to 80% ( 3– 6 ).\nSince these early reports, there have been numerous improvements in surgical and postoperative techniques. We sought to evaluate the early and late results of the modified Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy syndrome.\nVariables traditionally known to correlate with poor out- come were assessed. Current health status of survivors was obtained.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients. A total of 142 patients with heterotaxy syn- drome were identified in the Mayo Clinic Fontan data- base from 1975 through 2004. No patients with hetero- taxy syndrome who had a Fontan procedure were excluded. Hospital and outpatient records were ab- stracted for preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical and hemodynamic data. Additionally, all patients who were not known to be deceased were sent health status questionnaires. Current addresses and date of death were cross-referenced with Accurint, a locate-and- research database. Patients who did not return their questionnaires after the first mailing received 2 additional mailings and a reminder by telephone. The median age at Fontan procedure was 9 years (range: 2 to 35 years) with 82 (58%) being male. Median follow-up was 4.5 years; the longest was 23 years.\nFrom the Divisions of *Pediatric Cardiology, †Cardiovascular Diseases and Internal Medicine, ‡Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, and §Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.

Asplenia was diagnosed in 76 patients (54%) and polysplenia in 66 (46%) ( Table 1 ). Ambiguous abdominal situs was the most frequent type of visceral situs (76%). Levocardia (56%) was slightly more common than dextrocardia (42%). The majority of patients had a common atrioventricular valve (79%). The ventricular morphology was usually unbalanced, with 70% having non-left ventricular morphology. Anomalous pulmonary venous connections were present in 64% of patients. Abnormalities of the systemic venous connections also were common. Bilateral superior vena cavae (SVC) were found in 75 (53%) patients. Interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos or hemiazygos continuation to the SVC was present in 75 patients (54%). The hepatic veins entered the atrium separate from the IVC in 79 cases (57%).\nEras of operation. The 30-year study period was divided into 3 equal chronologic eras based on the date of the\nFontan operation. The early era, 1975 through 1984, included 30 patients. The majority of operations were performed during the middle era, 1985 through 1994, with 91 patients. An additional 21 patients had the operation in the most recent era, 1995 through 2004 ( Fig. 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference between eras in age at surgery, gender, or number of previous surgical palliations ( Table 2 ). Previous palliative procedures. For 22 patients (16%), the Fontan operation was their first surgical procedure. Seventy- nine patients (56%) had 1 previous palliative procedure, 30 (21%) had 2, and 11 (8%) had ⱖ 3 ( Table 3 ). Fontan connection. The types of Fontan connections that were used are listed in Table 4 . Only 6 patients had a fenestration, and all of those were performed in the recent era. Atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement was performed in 8 patients (6%) and repaired in 37 patients (26%) at the time of the Fontan procedure.\nStatistical analysis. We used the same independent vari- ables of interest that were used in previous outcome studies of the Fontan operation from the Mayo Clinic ( 3,4,7–9 ). Univariate assessment of the association of variables with mortality was performed using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Cumulative survival was estimated using the\n\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms\nKaplan-Meier method. Models were constructed with Cox proportional-hazard models using a stepwise elimination of the nonsignificant variables performed using a p value cut point to retain variables ⬍ 0.05. For all other comparisons, 2-tail p values of ⱕ 0.05 were taken as evidence of findings not attributable to chance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly mortality. Overall, 32 patients (23%) died within 30 days after operation or before hospital discharge. Early mortality decreased over time, from 50.0% in the early era to 16.5% in the middle era and 9.5% in the most recent era. Comparing the early era with both the middle (p ⬍ 0.001) and the recent eras (p ⫽ 0.003), there has been a significant decrease in early mortality. Comparing the middle era to the recent era, there is a trend toward decreased mortality, but it is not statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.42). No early deaths occurred in 6 patients who had fenestration as part of the Fontan procedure (all performed in the most recent era). Univariate predictors of early mortality. The variables that correlated significantly with early mortality were a preoperative cardiothoracic ratio ⬎ 0.6, elevated systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure, prolonged bypass time, postoperative mean right atrial pressure ⬎ 20 mm Hg, and postoperative renal failure ( Table 5 ). Late mortality. Using a combined approach of chart review and Accurint searches, 29 late deaths were identified, ranging from 97 days to 20 years after operation. The cause of death was known in 19 cases. Five patients died after late reoperation, 4 with asplenia died from sepsis, 4 were sudden and presumed due to an arrhythmia, 3 were attributed to progressive myocardial failure, 1 to pulmonary hemorrhage, 1 to suicide, and 1 to a motor vehicle accident. Clinical or autopsy data could not be obtained for 10 of the 29 patients.\nHowever, accurate dates of death were available for all 29 patients.\nActuarial cumulative survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 64%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. In the early surgical era, early mortality was high (50%) and cumulative long-term survival was poor (33%, 33%, and 30% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively). Early- and long-term survival improved in the 2 more recent eras. Combining only the 2 most recent eras, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 72%, 63%, and 60%, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Univariate predictors of late mortality. Only bypass time ⬎ 120 min and AV valve replacement were predictive of late mortality, with odds ratios of 5.59 and 6.24, respec- tively (p ⬍ 0.05).\nCurrent health and functional status. Excluding the 32 early deaths and the 29 late deaths, there were 81 (57%) late survivors available to assess current health and functional status. Follow-up data were obtained for 41 (51%) of these patients by written questionnaire or by return clinic visit during the data acquisition portion of this study. For these 41 patients, the median follow-up interval after the Fontan operation was 15 years (range 1 to 23 years). Of these patients, 80% reported having no or mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity, 18% had moderate symptoms with less than normal physical activity, and 3% had symp- toms at rest. Specific signs and symptoms consisted of easy fatigue (49%), palpitations (39%), shortness of breath (32%), persistent cyanosis (24%), and chest pain (20%). Despite this optimistic self-reported current health status, these 41 patients had numerous medical complications. Nineteen patients (46%) reported a history of an arrhythmia and 9 (22%) required placement of a permanent pacemaker. A thromboembolic event occurred in 5 patients (12%). Protein-losing enteropathy was diagnosed in 1 patient (2%). One patient had cardiac transplantation (lateral tunnel), 1 was currently listed for transplant (right ventricular outflow tract to pulmonary artery), and 1 was being evaluated for transplantation (Kawashima-type connection).\nMost (95%) of these 41 patients were taking ⱖ 1 medication. The most frequent medications included angiotension- converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor block- ers (73%), digoxin (66%), daily antibiotic prophylaxis (53%), aspirin (54%), warfarin (43%), beta-blocker (24%), and aldac- tone (18%). Of the patients with asplenia, 81% were taking daily antibiotic prophylaxis.\nMost survivors (78%) were employed or attending formal education programs at the time of this review. Of those employed, 50% were working full time. Part-time employ-\nFigure 1. Number of Fontan operations performed at Mayo Clinic for heterotaxy syndrome.\n\n\nTable 2.

Even after the description of the Fontan operation, the criteria developed by Choussat et al. ( 10 ) essentially ex- cluded patients with heterotaxy syndrome from having a Fontan operation. However, clinicians expanded the indi- cations and in the mid-1970s the Fontan operation was used to treat patients with all forms of complex functional single ventricle, including patients with heterotaxy syndrome. Unfortunately the mortality for patients with heterotaxy who had a Fontan operation was high. Humes et al. ( 4 ) reported an early mortality of 43%. In early outcome series after the Fontan operation, heterotaxy frequently was one variable that predicted poor outcome ( 7 ). Investigators in the 1980s recognized that heterotaxy per se may not have been the most critical variable that predicted high mortality. Rather, the more important fac- tors relating to mortality were poor ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, and complex surgical repair with pro- longed bypass time ( 7 ). Investigators believed that the Fontan operation could be successful for patients with heterotaxy if the operation was performed before develop- ment of ventricular dysfunction and/or significant AV valve insufficiency. Surgical techniques improved over time, per- mitting shorter duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.\nIn the present study, several recognized risk factors for early mortality (AV valve repair, decreased ventricular sys-\ntolic function, and elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance) were not predictive of outcome. Similar experience has been reported in other recent series ( 3,8,11,12 ). This may be due to several factors, such as better patient selection, staged repair, advancement of surgical techniques, and improved postoperative management. Despite these encouraging re- sults, children with functional single ventricle and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections have a 53% mortality at the time of initial palliative operation, and the mortality for the subsequent cavopulmonary anastomosis also is substantial (38%) ( 13 ). Therefore, many “high-risk” patients with heterotaxy and functional single ventricle may never reach the age to have a Fontan operation ( 14,15 ). Atrioventricular valve repair or replacement previously has been associated with early mortality ( 3 ). Therefore, clinical practice has evolved and led to AV valve repair/ replacement before completion of the Fontan connection. In the current cohort, AV valve repair or replacement was not predictive of early mortality, which may be an important factor resulting in improved early mortality.\nFigure 2.

This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the type of Fontan procedure and outcome.\nIn the recent era (1995 to 2004), early mortality after Fontan decreased to 9.5% but remained greater than the early mortality for patients with double-inlet left ventricle and tricuspid atresia (3% and 2%, respectively) during a similar time period at the Mayo Clinic ( 8,9 ). Because early mortality for patients with heterotaxy syndrome remains substantially higher than for patients with other forms of functional single ventricle, one may propose that all patients with heterotaxy syndrome who have a Fontan operation should also have a fenestration performed.

Arrhythmias were reported in 46% of the patients with heterotaxy compared with 57% of patients with double-inlet left ventricle ( 8 ). Because patients with heterotaxy undergo extensive intra-atrial baffling pro- cedures, one might anticipate a higher incidence of arrhyth- mia than for patients having less extensive atrial surgery. We did not find this to be true. However, the patients with heterotaxy had a shorter follow-up interval (4 vs.12 years) than the patients with double-inlet left ventricle. Longer follow-up may demonstrate that patients with heterotaxy have an even higher risk of sudden death and arrhythmias than patients with less complex forms of functional single ventricle. Thus, a detailed and aggressive approach to surveillance and therapy for arrhythmias is essential.\nSurvival after the Fontan operation for patients with heterotaxy has improved despite the anatomic complexity of their cardiac disease. Many factors have contributed to the improved survival. In our assessment of long-term survival many of these factors were subtle and evolved simulta- neously. This made it difficult in the retrospective statistical analysis to delineate specific factors that affect outcome. It is\nmost likely that improved patient selection, staging of surgical repair, younger age at time of Fontan operation, refinements in surgical techniques, and advancement of postoperative care have all contributed to the improved results.\nConclusions. Over the past 30 years, there has been a significant improvement in the early outcome for patients with heterotaxy syndrome after a modified Fontan opera- tion. However, mortality and morbidity remain substantial. Discovery of innovative treatment methods is essential. Furthermore, meticulous long-term medical management at centers specializing in the care of congenital heart disease is mandatory.\nReprint requests and correspondence: Dr. Frank Cetta, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

Systemic rheumatic diseases are characterized by a long natural history with few symptoms, an undifferentiated picture or a remitting course making difficult a timely diagnosis. It has been suggested that screening measures for these diseases could be useful but the impact of unrecognized systemic rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcome is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of previously unrecognized systemic autoimmune rheumatic on the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR).\nMethods: A longitudinal cohort-study with enrolment during the first trimester of pregnancy of women attending routine antenatal care using a two-step approach with a self-reported questionnaire, autoantibody detection and clinical evaluation of antibody-positive subjects. The incidence of FGR and preeclampsia in subjects with newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was compared to that of selected negative controls adjusting for potential confounders by logistic regression analysis.\nResults: The prevalence of previously unrecognized systemic rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for rheumatoid arthritis (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for systemic lupus erythematosus, 0.31 % (16/5232) for Sjögren ’ s syndrome, 0.3 % for primary antiphospholipid syndrome (14/5232) and 0.11 % (6/5232) for other miscellaneous diseases.\nUndifferentiated connective tissue disease was diagnosed in an additional 131 subjects (2.5 %). The incidence of either FGR or preeclampsia was 6.1 % (36/594) among controls and 25.3 % (50/198) in subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (excess incidence = 3.9 % (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6) or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of FGR/preeclampsia). The incidence of small for gestational age infant (SGA) was higher among subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (41/198 as compared to 46/594; adjOdds Ratio = 3.1, 95 % CI =1.96 – 4.95) than in controls. The excess incidence associated with unrecognized rheumatic diseases was 2.7 % (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.

It has been estimated that approximately one in 12 women will develop a definite inflammatory rheumatic disease during her lifetime [1]. In addition, establishing and emerging data suggest that the natural history of RA, SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic disease encompasses a so-called preclinical disease phase lasting from months to several years and characterized by little or no clinical find- ings and by the presence of detectable autoimmune anti- bodies [2, 3]. These data suggest that autoantibodies and autoimmune rheumatic diseases at various stages of deve- lopment, often unrecognized or undiagnosed, are much more common in the general population than previously recognized [3, 4]. Systemic rheumatic disorders or the preclinical stages of these diseases are not entirely benign and have been associated with increased risks of subcli- nical atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and lung diseases [2, 5]. In addition, several studies have shown that higher than expected rates of reproductive failures, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia occur before the clinical occurrence or the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [6, 7], suggesting a potential causal role of unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune disorders in the occurrence of pregnancy complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously unrecognized autoimmune rheumatic disorders during pregnancy and to measure their impact on the incidence of fetal growth failure and preeclampsia.\n\n\nMethods\nSubjects for the study were recruited among unselected pregnant women who obtained antenatal care at our Department during the first trimester of pregnancy. As this was a cohort pilot study involving only a few mem- bers of staff, we restricted the enrolment to all women attending the clinic for antenatal care each Monday during a 6-year period (May 2009 to June 2014). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of our Department (Procedure n.20110034530). Enrolment criteria included: a) singleton pregnancy; b) antenatal care and\ndelivery at our Department; c) fluency in the Italian language; d) no previous diagnosis or treatment of connective tissue diseases; e) absence of fetal malformations or chromosomal anomalies. The characteristics of the study and the validation of the methods used have been already reported elsewhere [8]. Briefly, after informed consent and before the medical evaluation, each woman was asked to complete a screening questionnaire including any connective tissue disorder symptoms (Table 1). Women who answered positively to one or more of the questions were tested for the presence of circulating autoantibodies, including antinuclear anti- body (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), anticardiolipin antibody, anti- β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (a β 2GPI) and lupus anticoa- gulant, according to standardized methods, as previously described [9]. The ANA test was considered positive at a titer ≥ 1:80. To ensure random sampling, the first three subjects with negative responses to all the items in the questionnaire after each index case diagnosed with a rheumatic disease (major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases) and willing to participate in the study were tested for autoantibodies and served as the control. Cases and controls were referred to the rheumatology unit of our hospital for further clinical assessment including a careful history and a physical examination. Rheumato- logists were unaware of the results of the questionnaires. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide anti- bodies were not included in the screening autoantibody profile, but were tested only in patients with arthritis after\n\n\nTable 1 Ten-item questionnaire administered\n1.

Rheumatic diseases were classified according to widely used criteria for undifferen- tiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) [10], RA [11], SLE [12], anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) [13], Sjögren ’ s syndrome [14], systemic sclerosis [15], polymyo- sitis/dermatomyositis [16] and mixed connective tissue disease [17]. Patients with suspected rheumatic disease (symptoms plus autoantibodies) but not fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were classified as the no criteria for diagnosis group. Monthly rheumatological clinical assessment during pregnancy was carried out in subjects with major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases and in those without criteria for a definite diagnosis.\nAfter Ist trimester enrolment, gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound, and cases and controls were followed-up with monthly obstetric clinical and ultrasono- graphic evaluations. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in the first and second trimester was evaluated according to standard methods [18]. Pulsatility indices of uterine or umbilical arteries were considered abnormal when the values were higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves [18]. FGR was diagnosed when the abdominal fetal circumference at ultrasonographic exam- ination fell below the 10 th percentile of our local reference curves, confirmed on at least two consecutive measure- ments taken 2 weeks apart after the standard US obtained at 18 – 22 weeks of pregnancy, and PI of umbilical artery was higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves sig- naling a reduced perfusion of fetal placental unit. Pre- eclampsia was diagnosed according to standard criteria [19]. Small for gestational age infants were diagnosed when birth weight was below the 10 th percentile of the Italian population [20].\nStatistical analyses were carried out with one-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare continuous variables between the groups stud- ied. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson ’ s χ 2 . Partitioning of χ 2 statistics with the Bonferroni correc- tion for multiple comparisons was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons in two × K tables. Associations between the diagnostic category of the rheumatic disorder and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression analysis by computing odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders (Stata 12.0 for Windows. (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\nLogistic models included complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, FGR, SGA) as outcome variables and nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), pre- vious history of low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant, chronic hypertension (yes, no) and the diagnostic category of the autoimmune rheumatic disease (major rheumatic disease, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, no criteria for diagnosis) as explanatory variables. Logistic regression was\nalso used to compute the percent excess incidence (percent population attributable risk) and the percent frac- tion of outcome (percent population attributable fraction) associated with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [21].\n\n\nResults\nOut of the 5451 eligible subjects enrolled during the period of the study, 5232 (96 %) gave their consent and completed the questionnaire. The rate of positivity to one or more questions was 9.8 % (511/5232). Of the 511 subjects with a positive questionnaire, 349 (68.3 %) tested positive for autoantibodies and were sent to the rheumatology unit for evaluation. The prevalence of the different rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for RA (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for SLE, 0.31 % for Sjögren ’ s syndrome (16/5232), 0.3 % for primary APS (14/5232) and 0.11 % for other miscellaneous causes (two subjects with systemic sclerosis, one with mixed connective tissue disease one with Wegener syndrome and one with monoarticular arthritis). The overall prevalence of major connective tissue disease was 1.3 % (68/5232). UCTD was the most common unrecognized rheumatologic disorder and was diagnosed in 2.5 % (131/5232) of subjects. Finally, 150 out of the 349 subjects with symptoms and autoantibodies (43 %) had insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of a definite rheumatic disease.\nTable 2 reports the distribution of symptoms and auto- immune antibodies in the groups studied. More than 50 % of women with UCTD or a with major rheumatic disease reported three or more symptoms; on the other hand, 5.4 % of controls tested positive for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:80 or more. Photosensitivity and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon were the most common symp- toms among subjects diagnosed with UCTD (73/131 and 92/131) and those without a definite diagnosis (85/150 and 78/150, respectively). Of the 150 subjects without a definite diagnosis, 116 ANA (77.3 %) positive subjects had a clinical picture resembling UCTD but with symp- toms lasting less than 3 years, whereas the remaining 34 (22.7 %) had an incomplete picture of a major rheumatic disease.\nAfter the first trimester of pregnancy, corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine were given to 23 (17.6 %) women with UCTD and to 20 (29.4 %) with a definite connective tissue disease. After a definite rheumatological diagnosis, low-molecular dose heparin and/or aspirin were administered in 18 (26.5 %) and 42 (61.8 %) of subjects with major rheumatic diseases and 15 (11.5 %) and 48 (36.6 %) of those with UCTD, respectively. Overall, among the 199 women with a definite rheumatic disease, heparin was given to 26 (13.1 %) subjects with primary or second- ary APS and to 7 (3.5 %) women with a previous throm- botic events.\nInfants born to subjects with rheumatic symptoms, irrespective of diagnosis, had a lower gestational age and birthweight than controls (Table 3). In the post-hoc analysis, and after Bonferroni correction, gestational age and birthweight among subjects with a major rheumatic disease were lower when compared to the UCTD group ( p = 0.05 for both comparisons) and to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.001 and p = 0.012 for gesta- tional age and birthweight, respectively). Nulliparity was more common among controls than in any category of rheumatologic disorder ( p &lt;0.05 for all comparisons), whereas a previous low-birthweight infant was more common among subjects with a major rheumatic disease than in controls.\nIncreased placental vascular resistance, as suggested by increased pulsatility indices in the first and second trimester uterine artery and third trimester umbilical artery, were higher in all the categories of rheumatic disorders, including subjects without a definite diagno- sis, than in controls ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons in the post-hoc analysis) (Table 4). Umbilical artery PI was also higher among major rheumatic diseases when compared to either UCTD ( p = 0.009) or to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p = 0.017). These results were also confirmed in the categorical analysis since the rates of first and second trimester uterine artery bilateral notches\nTable 2 Number of positive questionnaire answers and autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nTable 3 Main demographic variables autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nand third trimester umbilical artery PI &gt; 95 th percentile were higher among all categories of rheumatic disorders than in controls ( p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). In the partition of the chi-square analysis, compared to the negative controls, the rates of preeclampsia or FGR were more common among all categories of rheumatic disor- ders, including subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons). Finally, the rates of SGA infants were higher among patients with major rheumatic diseases ( p &lt;0.001) and UCTD ( p = 0.007) than in controls. Table 5 reports the results of the logistic regression analysis. Putative risk factors for preeclampsia and/or fetal growth failure that differed among cases and con- trols at p ≤ 0.1 level (nulliparity, first trimester smoking, previous low birthweight infant and chronic hyperten- sion) were inserted in the model as confounders. The likelihood of either FGR or preeclampsia was five times higher among subjects with defined rheumatic disorders, either UCTD or a major systemic disease, than in con- trols. The odds ratio of these two outcomes was also higher in subjects with a definite diagnosis of a rheu- matic disease than in those with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis ( p = 0.028). Overall, unrecognized rheumatic diseases, major or UCTD, were associated with an excess incidence of 3.9 cases per 100 subjects (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6), or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of either preeclampsia or FGR.\nThe overall adjusted prevalence of SGA in the popula- tion studied was 11.1 % (95 % CI = 9.2 – 13.2) (104/941). Major rheumatic diseases and UCTD were associated with an excess risk of SGA of 1.4 % (95 % CI = 0.6 – 2.1) and 1.3 % (95 % CI = 0.4 – 2.3), and with attributable fractions of 12.3 % (95 % CI = 5.2 – 18.8) and 12.5 % (95 % CI = 3.5 – 20.4), respectively. Overall, previously unrecognized rheumatic diseases, either major or UCTD, were associated with a significantly increased risk of SGA (OR = 3.1, 95 % CI = 1.96 – 4.95) and with an excess risk of 2.7 cases (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study have shown that unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune rheumatic disorders are rather common during the first trimester of pregnancy and are associated with a significant number of pre- eclampsia and fetal growth restriction cases. In parti- cular, the 1.3 % rate of definite rheumatic diseases detected during the first trimester of pregnancy was responsible for 15 % of all cases of preeclampsia or IUGR and for 12 % of all cases of SGA. After the inclu- sion of the 2.5 % rate of UCTD detected during the first trimester, unrecognized rheumatic disorders were respon- sible for up to 25 % of SGA and up to 34 % of preeclamp- sia/IUGR cases in our population. The strengths of this\nTable 4 Maternal and fetal Doppler velocimetry, and main obstetric outcomes among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nstudy include the prospective design, the methods used and the number of subjects recruited. Previous retro- spective studies have suggested that a clinical history of reproductive failure, preeclampsia, prematurity or FGR increases the subsequent risk of a diagnosis of rheumatic disease [22]. This association has prompted several authors to postulate a causal association between adverse reproductive events and subsequent occurrence of rheu- matic diseases such as RA or SLE [23]. Although the potential interference of pregnancy-associated hormonal and metabolic modifications on the subsequent occur- rence of rheumatic diseases cannot be entirely excluded, other retrospective studies suggest that a poor reproduc- tive outcome is rather a comorbidity of the long precli- nical phase of some rheumatic diseases rather than a true causative factor [3, 6, 7]. Our longitudinal data show that adverse obstetric events are common, not only among women with unrecognized rheumatic diseases with a definite diagnosis, but also among undifferentiated or even “ early ” rheumatic disorders which, without screening mea- sures, would have been undetected.\nPotential selection biases are the main limitations of the study. We used a two-step screening approach including a self-administered questionnaire and subsequent autoanti- body detection, which in a pilot study demonstrated excel- lent detection rates of rheumatic disease [8]. In addition,\nthe validity of a similar approach has been extensively confirmed in the diagnosis of RA, SLE and Sjögren ’ s syn- drome both in Europe and in other countries [11 – 16]. The rate of false negatives using this method is very low [8]; thus, the prevalence rates detected in our study should not be biased by underdiagnosis. In addition, to avoid overdiagnosis, we used standard definitions for the diag- nosis of RA, SLE, Sjögren ’ s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, APS and UCTD and rheumatological clinical assessments were repeated monthly during pregnancy. The overall rate of definite rheumatic diseases and UCTD in our study is consistent with the 5 % rate of major rheumatic diseases reported in the general population [1, 3], however, since recruitment took place in a public hospital, we cannot exclude a potential selection bias based on low socio- economic status. Definite rheumatic diseases such as RA, SLE or Sjögren ’ s syndrome can be unrecognized or un- diagnosed for long periods of time because the symptoms and signs are not specific and a precise diagnosis can be difficult to achieve [2 – 4]. Moreover, the natural history of these disorders follows a pattern of progression lasting from months to years, from a preclinical non-diagnostic phase to overt clinical disease [2, 3, 24]. Establishing the exact moment of transition from the preclinical to clinical phases is difficult; thus, in the general population, rheumatic diseases can be detected at various stages of\n\n\nTable 5 Crude incidence, odds ratio, population attributable risk and population attributable fraction of preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR) in the population studied after excluding subjects with spontaneous abortions\nFetal growth restriction (FGR)\nUCTD undifferentiated connective tissue disease\nOdds ratios (OR), population attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable fraction obtained by logistic regression analysis containing preeclampsia and/or FGR as outcomes and category of rheumatic disorders (controls, major rheumatic diseases, UCTD, no criteria for diagnosis), nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), chronic hypertension (yes, no) and previous low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant (yes, no) as explanatory variables. The analysis was carried out in 941 viable pregnancies\ndevelopment [24]. For these reasons, the 1.3 % rate of well-defined rheumatic disease in our population was not surprising. UCTD, defined as the presence of at least one clinical manifestation of a major rheumatic disease lasting at least 3 years and a positive ANA result, was the most frequent rheumatic disorder detected in our subjects. Although the risk of preeclampsia and fetal growth restric- tion associated with UCTD was lower than that associated with major rheumatic diseases, the burden of pregnancy complications associated with these two disorders was similar. The group of subjects with UCTD probably includes either women in the preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease or women with a stable mild rheumatic disorder [25]. Whatever the composition of this group of rheumatic disorders, our results confirm preliminary data showing that UCTD is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [26]. According to Mosca et al., [27], the group of subjects with no criteria for a definite diagnosis of a rheumatic disease probably contains subjects in the early phase of stable UCTD as well as subjects at an early phase or in a true preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease. Although, in our study, the impact of this condition on the incidence of FGR or preeclampsia was considerably lower than that of either UCTD or major rheumatic diseases, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in these subjects than in negative controls.\nInadequate trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries with a subsequent defective establishment of maternal- fetal vascularization and oxygen and nutrient exchange is considered the probable mechanism underlying the adverse effect of rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcomes [27]. A direct effect of maternal autoantibodies on trophoblast invasiveness as well as maternal proinflam- matory status and endothelial dysfunction seem to medi- ate defective placentation among subjects with rheumatic disorders [27]. The results of our study confirm these suggestions. In fact, we found increased second trimester pulsatility indices and bilateral notching of uterine arteries in all categories of rheumatic disorders compared to controls. These Doppler findings are associated with inad- equate trophoblast invasion of myometrial spiral arteries, leading to an increased risk of preeclampsia and FGR [23, 27]. A vascular mechanism could also be postulated for the adverse effect of preclinical rheumatic diseases on pregnancy outcome. In fact, it has been demonstrated that autoantibodies related to pre-disease stages could increase the risk of peripheral vascular damage, leading to accele- rated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [5].\nThe rate of unrecognized rheumatic disorders in the general population could be affected by the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the population and by the time and the frequency of contact with the health care system. For these reasons, our results cannot be generalized to\nother populations. However, given their long and often unpredictable natural history, it is likely that in the general population of countries with a high incidence of rheu- matic disorders, a significant proportion of subjects in the preclinical stage of these diseases can go undetected for a long period of time. The identification of this group of subjects early during pregnancy could lead to a timely treatment of rheumatic disorders and also to a prevention of pregnancy complications [28].\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate that a first trimester detailed history on symptoms suggesting a systemic connective tissue disease can be useful in the early detection of a previ- ously undiagnosed systemic rheumatic disease. Screen- ing measures for rheumatic disorders have the potential to improve both disease outcomes and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and adverse reproductive consequences [3, 29]. However, factors regulating the performance of a screening approach such as tests to be used, the population to be tested, the magnitude of net benefits and the harms associated with screening for rheumatic disorders are still uncertain [2 – 4]. Future studies may clarify if screening programs are applicable to populations at risk and whether the identification of subjects with rheumatic disorders at various stages of the disease could translate to a better prognosis and the prevention of associated comorbidities such as preg- nancy complications.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nANA: Antinuclear antibody (ANA); APS: Anti-phospholipid syndrome; ENA: Anti-extractable nuclear antigen; FGR: Fetal growth retsriction; PI: Pulsatility index; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; SGA: Small for gestational age; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematous; UCTD: Uundifferentiated connective tissue disease\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant Ricerca Corrente 2012 .

Systemic rheumatic diseases are characterized by a long natural history with few symptoms, an undifferentiated picture or a remitting course making difficult a timely diagnosis. It has been suggested that screening measures for these diseases could be useful but the impact of unrecognized systemic rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcome is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of previously unrecognized systemic autoimmune rheumatic on the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR).\nMethods: A longitudinal cohort-study with enrolment during the first trimester of pregnancy of women attending routine antenatal care using a two-step approach with a self-reported questionnaire, autoantibody detection and clinical evaluation of antibody-positive subjects. The incidence of FGR and preeclampsia in subjects with newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was compared to that of selected negative controls adjusting for potential confounders by logistic regression analysis.\nResults: The prevalence of previously unrecognized systemic rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for rheumatoid arthritis (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for systemic lupus erythematosus, 0.31 % (16/5232) for Sjögren ’ s syndrome, 0.3 % for primary antiphospholipid syndrome (14/5232) and 0.11 % (6/5232) for other miscellaneous diseases.\nUndifferentiated connective tissue disease was diagnosed in an additional 131 subjects (2.5 %). The incidence of either FGR or preeclampsia was 6.1 % (36/594) among controls and 25.3 % (50/198) in subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (excess incidence = 3.9 % (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6) or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of FGR/preeclampsia). The incidence of small for gestational age infant (SGA) was higher among subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (41/198 as compared to 46/594; adjOdds Ratio = 3.1, 95 % CI =1.96 – 4.95) than in controls. The excess incidence associated with unrecognized rheumatic diseases was 2.7 % (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.

It has been estimated that approximately one in 12 women will develop a definite inflammatory rheumatic disease during her lifetime [1]. In addition, establishing and emerging data suggest that the natural history of RA, SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic disease encompasses a so-called preclinical disease phase lasting from months to several years and characterized by little or no clinical find- ings and by the presence of detectable autoimmune anti- bodies [2, 3]. These data suggest that autoantibodies and autoimmune rheumatic diseases at various stages of deve- lopment, often unrecognized or undiagnosed, are much more common in the general population than previously recognized [3, 4]. Systemic rheumatic disorders or the preclinical stages of these diseases are not entirely benign and have been associated with increased risks of subcli- nical atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and lung diseases [2, 5]. In addition, several studies have shown that higher than expected rates of reproductive failures, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia occur before the clinical occurrence or the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [6, 7], suggesting a potential causal role of unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune disorders in the occurrence of pregnancy complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously unrecognized autoimmune rheumatic disorders during pregnancy and to measure their impact on the incidence of fetal growth failure and preeclampsia.\n\n\nMethods\nSubjects for the study were recruited among unselected pregnant women who obtained antenatal care at our Department during the first trimester of pregnancy. As this was a cohort pilot study involving only a few mem- bers of staff, we restricted the enrolment to all women attending the clinic for antenatal care each Monday during a 6-year period (May 2009 to June 2014). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of our Department (Procedure n.20110034530). Enrolment criteria included: a) singleton pregnancy; b) antenatal care and\ndelivery at our Department; c) fluency in the Italian language; d) no previous diagnosis or treatment of connective tissue diseases; e) absence of fetal malformations or chromosomal anomalies. The characteristics of the study and the validation of the methods used have been already reported elsewhere [8]. Briefly, after informed consent and before the medical evaluation, each woman was asked to complete a screening questionnaire including any connective tissue disorder symptoms (Table 1). Women who answered positively to one or more of the questions were tested for the presence of circulating autoantibodies, including antinuclear anti- body (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), anticardiolipin antibody, anti- β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (a β 2GPI) and lupus anticoa- gulant, according to standardized methods, as previously described [9]. The ANA test was considered positive at a titer ≥ 1:80. To ensure random sampling, the first three subjects with negative responses to all the items in the questionnaire after each index case diagnosed with a rheumatic disease (major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases) and willing to participate in the study were tested for autoantibodies and served as the control. Cases and controls were referred to the rheumatology unit of our hospital for further clinical assessment including a careful history and a physical examination. Rheumato- logists were unaware of the results of the questionnaires. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide anti- bodies were not included in the screening autoantibody profile, but were tested only in patients with arthritis after\n\n\nTable 1 Ten-item questionnaire administered\n1.

Rheumatic diseases were classified according to widely used criteria for undifferen- tiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) [10], RA [11], SLE [12], anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) [13], Sjögren ’ s syndrome [14], systemic sclerosis [15], polymyo- sitis/dermatomyositis [16] and mixed connective tissue disease [17]. Patients with suspected rheumatic disease (symptoms plus autoantibodies) but not fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were classified as the no criteria for diagnosis group. Monthly rheumatological clinical assessment during pregnancy was carried out in subjects with major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases and in those without criteria for a definite diagnosis.\nAfter Ist trimester enrolment, gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound, and cases and controls were followed-up with monthly obstetric clinical and ultrasono- graphic evaluations. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in the first and second trimester was evaluated according to standard methods [18]. Pulsatility indices of uterine or umbilical arteries were considered abnormal when the values were higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves [18]. FGR was diagnosed when the abdominal fetal circumference at ultrasonographic exam- ination fell below the 10 th percentile of our local reference curves, confirmed on at least two consecutive measure- ments taken 2 weeks apart after the standard US obtained at 18 – 22 weeks of pregnancy, and PI of umbilical artery was higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves sig- naling a reduced perfusion of fetal placental unit. Pre- eclampsia was diagnosed according to standard criteria [19]. Small for gestational age infants were diagnosed when birth weight was below the 10 th percentile of the Italian population [20].\nStatistical analyses were carried out with one-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare continuous variables between the groups stud- ied. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson ’ s χ 2 . Partitioning of χ 2 statistics with the Bonferroni correc- tion for multiple comparisons was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons in two × K tables. Associations between the diagnostic category of the rheumatic disorder and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression analysis by computing odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders (Stata 12.0 for Windows. (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\nLogistic models included complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, FGR, SGA) as outcome variables and nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), pre- vious history of low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant, chronic hypertension (yes, no) and the diagnostic category of the autoimmune rheumatic disease (major rheumatic disease, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, no criteria for diagnosis) as explanatory variables. Logistic regression was\nalso used to compute the percent excess incidence (percent population attributable risk) and the percent frac- tion of outcome (percent population attributable fraction) associated with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [21].\n\n\nResults\nOut of the 5451 eligible subjects enrolled during the period of the study, 5232 (96 %) gave their consent and completed the questionnaire. The rate of positivity to one or more questions was 9.8 % (511/5232). Of the 511 subjects with a positive questionnaire, 349 (68.3 %) tested positive for autoantibodies and were sent to the rheumatology unit for evaluation. The prevalence of the different rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for RA (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for SLE, 0.31 % for Sjögren ’ s syndrome (16/5232), 0.3 % for primary APS (14/5232) and 0.11 % for other miscellaneous causes (two subjects with systemic sclerosis, one with mixed connective tissue disease one with Wegener syndrome and one with monoarticular arthritis). The overall prevalence of major connective tissue disease was 1.3 % (68/5232). UCTD was the most common unrecognized rheumatologic disorder and was diagnosed in 2.5 % (131/5232) of subjects. Finally, 150 out of the 349 subjects with symptoms and autoantibodies (43 %) had insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of a definite rheumatic disease.\nTable 2 reports the distribution of symptoms and auto- immune antibodies in the groups studied. More than 50 % of women with UCTD or a with major rheumatic disease reported three or more symptoms; on the other hand, 5.4 % of controls tested positive for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:80 or more. Photosensitivity and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon were the most common symp- toms among subjects diagnosed with UCTD (73/131 and 92/131) and those without a definite diagnosis (85/150 and 78/150, respectively). Of the 150 subjects without a definite diagnosis, 116 ANA (77.3 %) positive subjects had a clinical picture resembling UCTD but with symp- toms lasting less than 3 years, whereas the remaining 34 (22.7 %) had an incomplete picture of a major rheumatic disease.\nAfter the first trimester of pregnancy, corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine were given to 23 (17.6 %) women with UCTD and to 20 (29.4 %) with a definite connective tissue disease. After a definite rheumatological diagnosis, low-molecular dose heparin and/or aspirin were administered in 18 (26.5 %) and 42 (61.8 %) of subjects with major rheumatic diseases and 15 (11.5 %) and 48 (36.6 %) of those with UCTD, respectively. Overall, among the 199 women with a definite rheumatic disease, heparin was given to 26 (13.1 %) subjects with primary or second- ary APS and to 7 (3.5 %) women with a previous throm- botic events.\nInfants born to subjects with rheumatic symptoms, irrespective of diagnosis, had a lower gestational age and birthweight than controls (Table 3). In the post-hoc analysis, and after Bonferroni correction, gestational age and birthweight among subjects with a major rheumatic disease were lower when compared to the UCTD group ( p = 0.05 for both comparisons) and to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.001 and p = 0.012 for gesta- tional age and birthweight, respectively). Nulliparity was more common among controls than in any category of rheumatologic disorder ( p &lt;0.05 for all comparisons), whereas a previous low-birthweight infant was more common among subjects with a major rheumatic disease than in controls.\nIncreased placental vascular resistance, as suggested by increased pulsatility indices in the first and second trimester uterine artery and third trimester umbilical artery, were higher in all the categories of rheumatic disorders, including subjects without a definite diagno- sis, than in controls ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons in the post-hoc analysis) (Table 4). Umbilical artery PI was also higher among major rheumatic diseases when compared to either UCTD ( p = 0.009) or to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p = 0.017). These results were also confirmed in the categorical analysis since the rates of first and second trimester uterine artery bilateral notches\nTable 2 Number of positive questionnaire answers and autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nTable 3 Main demographic variables autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nand third trimester umbilical artery PI &gt; 95 th percentile were higher among all categories of rheumatic disorders than in controls ( p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). In the partition of the chi-square analysis, compared to the negative controls, the rates of preeclampsia or FGR were more common among all categories of rheumatic disor- ders, including subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons). Finally, the rates of SGA infants were higher among patients with major rheumatic diseases ( p &lt;0.001) and UCTD ( p = 0.007) than in controls. Table 5 reports the results of the logistic regression analysis. Putative risk factors for preeclampsia and/or fetal growth failure that differed among cases and con- trols at p ≤ 0.1 level (nulliparity, first trimester smoking, previous low birthweight infant and chronic hyperten- sion) were inserted in the model as confounders. The likelihood of either FGR or preeclampsia was five times higher among subjects with defined rheumatic disorders, either UCTD or a major systemic disease, than in con- trols. The odds ratio of these two outcomes was also higher in subjects with a definite diagnosis of a rheu- matic disease than in those with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis ( p = 0.028). Overall, unrecognized rheumatic diseases, major or UCTD, were associated with an excess incidence of 3.9 cases per 100 subjects (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6), or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of either preeclampsia or FGR.\nThe overall adjusted prevalence of SGA in the popula- tion studied was 11.1 % (95 % CI = 9.2 – 13.2) (104/941). Major rheumatic diseases and UCTD were associated with an excess risk of SGA of 1.4 % (95 % CI = 0.6 – 2.1) and 1.3 % (95 % CI = 0.4 – 2.3), and with attributable fractions of 12.3 % (95 % CI = 5.2 – 18.8) and 12.5 % (95 % CI = 3.5 – 20.4), respectively. Overall, previously unrecognized rheumatic diseases, either major or UCTD, were associated with a significantly increased risk of SGA (OR = 3.1, 95 % CI = 1.96 – 4.95) and with an excess risk of 2.7 cases (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study have shown that unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune rheumatic disorders are rather common during the first trimester of pregnancy and are associated with a significant number of pre- eclampsia and fetal growth restriction cases. In parti- cular, the 1.3 % rate of definite rheumatic diseases detected during the first trimester of pregnancy was responsible for 15 % of all cases of preeclampsia or IUGR and for 12 % of all cases of SGA. After the inclu- sion of the 2.5 % rate of UCTD detected during the first trimester, unrecognized rheumatic disorders were respon- sible for up to 25 % of SGA and up to 34 % of preeclamp- sia/IUGR cases in our population. The strengths of this\nTable 4 Maternal and fetal Doppler velocimetry, and main obstetric outcomes among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nstudy include the prospective design, the methods used and the number of subjects recruited. Previous retro- spective studies have suggested that a clinical history of reproductive failure, preeclampsia, prematurity or FGR increases the subsequent risk of a diagnosis of rheumatic disease [22]. This association has prompted several authors to postulate a causal association between adverse reproductive events and subsequent occurrence of rheu- matic diseases such as RA or SLE [23]. Although the potential interference of pregnancy-associated hormonal and metabolic modifications on the subsequent occur- rence of rheumatic diseases cannot be entirely excluded, other retrospective studies suggest that a poor reproduc- tive outcome is rather a comorbidity of the long precli- nical phase of some rheumatic diseases rather than a true causative factor [3, 6, 7]. Our longitudinal data show that adverse obstetric events are common, not only among women with unrecognized rheumatic diseases with a definite diagnosis, but also among undifferentiated or even “ early ” rheumatic disorders which, without screening mea- sures, would have been undetected.\nPotential selection biases are the main limitations of the study. We used a two-step screening approach including a self-administered questionnaire and subsequent autoanti- body detection, which in a pilot study demonstrated excel- lent detection rates of rheumatic disease [8]. In addition,\nthe validity of a similar approach has been extensively confirmed in the diagnosis of RA, SLE and Sjögren ’ s syn- drome both in Europe and in other countries [11 – 16]. The rate of false negatives using this method is very low [8]; thus, the prevalence rates detected in our study should not be biased by underdiagnosis. In addition, to avoid overdiagnosis, we used standard definitions for the diag- nosis of RA, SLE, Sjögren ’ s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, APS and UCTD and rheumatological clinical assessments were repeated monthly during pregnancy. The overall rate of definite rheumatic diseases and UCTD in our study is consistent with the 5 % rate of major rheumatic diseases reported in the general population [1, 3], however, since recruitment took place in a public hospital, we cannot exclude a potential selection bias based on low socio- economic status. Definite rheumatic diseases such as RA, SLE or Sjögren ’ s syndrome can be unrecognized or un- diagnosed for long periods of time because the symptoms and signs are not specific and a precise diagnosis can be difficult to achieve [2 – 4]. Moreover, the natural history of these disorders follows a pattern of progression lasting from months to years, from a preclinical non-diagnostic phase to overt clinical disease [2, 3, 24]. Establishing the exact moment of transition from the preclinical to clinical phases is difficult; thus, in the general population, rheumatic diseases can be detected at various stages of\n\n\nTable 5 Crude incidence, odds ratio, population attributable risk and population attributable fraction of preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR) in the population studied after excluding subjects with spontaneous abortions\nFetal growth restriction (FGR)\nUCTD undifferentiated connective tissue disease\nOdds ratios (OR), population attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable fraction obtained by logistic regression analysis containing preeclampsia and/or FGR as outcomes and category of rheumatic disorders (controls, major rheumatic diseases, UCTD, no criteria for diagnosis), nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), chronic hypertension (yes, no) and previous low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant (yes, no) as explanatory variables. The analysis was carried out in 941 viable pregnancies\ndevelopment [24]. For these reasons, the 1.3 % rate of well-defined rheumatic disease in our population was not surprising. UCTD, defined as the presence of at least one clinical manifestation of a major rheumatic disease lasting at least 3 years and a positive ANA result, was the most frequent rheumatic disorder detected in our subjects. Although the risk of preeclampsia and fetal growth restric- tion associated with UCTD was lower than that associated with major rheumatic diseases, the burden of pregnancy complications associated with these two disorders was similar. The group of subjects with UCTD probably includes either women in the preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease or women with a stable mild rheumatic disorder [25]. Whatever the composition of this group of rheumatic disorders, our results confirm preliminary data showing that UCTD is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [26]. According to Mosca et al., [27], the group of subjects with no criteria for a definite diagnosis of a rheumatic disease probably contains subjects in the early phase of stable UCTD as well as subjects at an early phase or in a true preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease. Although, in our study, the impact of this condition on the incidence of FGR or preeclampsia was considerably lower than that of either UCTD or major rheumatic diseases, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in these subjects than in negative controls.\nInadequate trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries with a subsequent defective establishment of maternal- fetal vascularization and oxygen and nutrient exchange is considered the probable mechanism underlying the adverse effect of rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcomes [27]. A direct effect of maternal autoantibodies on trophoblast invasiveness as well as maternal proinflam- matory status and endothelial dysfunction seem to medi- ate defective placentation among subjects with rheumatic disorders [27]. The results of our study confirm these suggestions. In fact, we found increased second trimester pulsatility indices and bilateral notching of uterine arteries in all categories of rheumatic disorders compared to controls. These Doppler findings are associated with inad- equate trophoblast invasion of myometrial spiral arteries, leading to an increased risk of preeclampsia and FGR [23, 27]. A vascular mechanism could also be postulated for the adverse effect of preclinical rheumatic diseases on pregnancy outcome. In fact, it has been demonstrated that autoantibodies related to pre-disease stages could increase the risk of peripheral vascular damage, leading to accele- rated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [5].\nThe rate of unrecognized rheumatic disorders in the general population could be affected by the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the population and by the time and the frequency of contact with the health care system. For these reasons, our results cannot be generalized to\nother populations. However, given their long and often unpredictable natural history, it is likely that in the general population of countries with a high incidence of rheu- matic disorders, a significant proportion of subjects in the preclinical stage of these diseases can go undetected for a long period of time. The identification of this group of subjects early during pregnancy could lead to a timely treatment of rheumatic disorders and also to a prevention of pregnancy complications [28].\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate that a first trimester detailed history on symptoms suggesting a systemic connective tissue disease can be useful in the early detection of a previ- ously undiagnosed systemic rheumatic disease. Screen- ing measures for rheumatic disorders have the potential to improve both disease outcomes and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and adverse reproductive consequences [3, 29]. However, factors regulating the performance of a screening approach such as tests to be used, the population to be tested, the magnitude of net benefits and the harms associated with screening for rheumatic disorders are still uncertain [2 – 4]. Future studies may clarify if screening programs are applicable to populations at risk and whether the identification of subjects with rheumatic disorders at various stages of the disease could translate to a better prognosis and the prevention of associated comorbidities such as preg- nancy complications.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nANA: Antinuclear antibody (ANA); APS: Anti-phospholipid syndrome; ENA: Anti-extractable nuclear antigen; FGR: Fetal growth retsriction; PI: Pulsatility index; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; SGA: Small for gestational age; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematous; UCTD: Uundifferentiated connective tissue disease\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant Ricerca Corrente 2012 .

Systemic rheumatic diseases are characterized by a long natural history with few symptoms, an undifferentiated picture or a remitting course making difficult a timely diagnosis. It has been suggested that screening measures for these diseases could be useful but the impact of unrecognized systemic rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcome is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of previously unrecognized systemic autoimmune rheumatic on the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR).\nMethods: A longitudinal cohort-study with enrolment during the first trimester of pregnancy of women attending routine antenatal care using a two-step approach with a self-reported questionnaire, autoantibody detection and clinical evaluation of antibody-positive subjects. The incidence of FGR and preeclampsia in subjects with newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was compared to that of selected negative controls adjusting for potential confounders by logistic regression analysis.\nResults: The prevalence of previously unrecognized systemic rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for rheumatoid arthritis (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for systemic lupus erythematosus, 0.31 % (16/5232) for Sjögren ’ s syndrome, 0.3 % for primary antiphospholipid syndrome (14/5232) and 0.11 % (6/5232) for other miscellaneous diseases.\nUndifferentiated connective tissue disease was diagnosed in an additional 131 subjects (2.5 %). The incidence of either FGR or preeclampsia was 6.1 % (36/594) among controls and 25.3 % (50/198) in subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (excess incidence = 3.9 % (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6) or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of FGR/preeclampsia). The incidence of small for gestational age infant (SGA) was higher among subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (41/198 as compared to 46/594; adjOdds Ratio = 3.1, 95 % CI =1.96 – 4.95) than in controls. The excess incidence associated with unrecognized rheumatic diseases was 2.7 % (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.

It has been estimated that approximately one in 12 women will develop a definite inflammatory rheumatic disease during her lifetime [1]. In addition, establishing and emerging data suggest that the natural history of RA, SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic disease encompasses a so-called preclinical disease phase lasting from months to several years and characterized by little or no clinical find- ings and by the presence of detectable autoimmune anti- bodies [2, 3]. These data suggest that autoantibodies and autoimmune rheumatic diseases at various stages of deve- lopment, often unrecognized or undiagnosed, are much more common in the general population than previously recognized [3, 4]. Systemic rheumatic disorders or the preclinical stages of these diseases are not entirely benign and have been associated with increased risks of subcli- nical atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and lung diseases [2, 5]. In addition, several studies have shown that higher than expected rates of reproductive failures, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia occur before the clinical occurrence or the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [6, 7], suggesting a potential causal role of unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune disorders in the occurrence of pregnancy complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously unrecognized autoimmune rheumatic disorders during pregnancy and to measure their impact on the incidence of fetal growth failure and preeclampsia.\n\n\nMethods\nSubjects for the study were recruited among unselected pregnant women who obtained antenatal care at our Department during the first trimester of pregnancy. As this was a cohort pilot study involving only a few mem- bers of staff, we restricted the enrolment to all women attending the clinic for antenatal care each Monday during a 6-year period (May 2009 to June 2014). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of our Department (Procedure n.20110034530). Enrolment criteria included: a) singleton pregnancy; b) antenatal care and\ndelivery at our Department; c) fluency in the Italian language; d) no previous diagnosis or treatment of connective tissue diseases; e) absence of fetal malformations or chromosomal anomalies. The characteristics of the study and the validation of the methods used have been already reported elsewhere [8]. Briefly, after informed consent and before the medical evaluation, each woman was asked to complete a screening questionnaire including any connective tissue disorder symptoms (Table 1). Women who answered positively to one or more of the questions were tested for the presence of circulating autoantibodies, including antinuclear anti- body (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), anticardiolipin antibody, anti- β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (a β 2GPI) and lupus anticoa- gulant, according to standardized methods, as previously described [9]. The ANA test was considered positive at a titer ≥ 1:80. To ensure random sampling, the first three subjects with negative responses to all the items in the questionnaire after each index case diagnosed with a rheumatic disease (major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases) and willing to participate in the study were tested for autoantibodies and served as the control. Cases and controls were referred to the rheumatology unit of our hospital for further clinical assessment including a careful history and a physical examination. Rheumato- logists were unaware of the results of the questionnaires. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide anti- bodies were not included in the screening autoantibody profile, but were tested only in patients with arthritis after\n\n\nTable 1 Ten-item questionnaire administered\n1.

Rheumatic diseases were classified according to widely used criteria for undifferen- tiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) [10], RA [11], SLE [12], anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) [13], Sjögren ’ s syndrome [14], systemic sclerosis [15], polymyo- sitis/dermatomyositis [16] and mixed connective tissue disease [17]. Patients with suspected rheumatic disease (symptoms plus autoantibodies) but not fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were classified as the no criteria for diagnosis group. Monthly rheumatological clinical assessment during pregnancy was carried out in subjects with major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases and in those without criteria for a definite diagnosis.\nAfter Ist trimester enrolment, gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound, and cases and controls were followed-up with monthly obstetric clinical and ultrasono- graphic evaluations. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in the first and second trimester was evaluated according to standard methods [18]. Pulsatility indices of uterine or umbilical arteries were considered abnormal when the values were higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves [18]. FGR was diagnosed when the abdominal fetal circumference at ultrasonographic exam- ination fell below the 10 th percentile of our local reference curves, confirmed on at least two consecutive measure- ments taken 2 weeks apart after the standard US obtained at 18 – 22 weeks of pregnancy, and PI of umbilical artery was higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves sig- naling a reduced perfusion of fetal placental unit. Pre- eclampsia was diagnosed according to standard criteria [19]. Small for gestational age infants were diagnosed when birth weight was below the 10 th percentile of the Italian population [20].\nStatistical analyses were carried out with one-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare continuous variables between the groups stud- ied. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson ’ s χ 2 . Partitioning of χ 2 statistics with the Bonferroni correc- tion for multiple comparisons was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons in two × K tables. Associations between the diagnostic category of the rheumatic disorder and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression analysis by computing odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders (Stata 12.0 for Windows. (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\nLogistic models included complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, FGR, SGA) as outcome variables and nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), pre- vious history of low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant, chronic hypertension (yes, no) and the diagnostic category of the autoimmune rheumatic disease (major rheumatic disease, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, no criteria for diagnosis) as explanatory variables. Logistic regression was\nalso used to compute the percent excess incidence (percent population attributable risk) and the percent frac- tion of outcome (percent population attributable fraction) associated with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [21].\n\n\nResults\nOut of the 5451 eligible subjects enrolled during the period of the study, 5232 (96 %) gave their consent and completed the questionnaire. The rate of positivity to one or more questions was 9.8 % (511/5232). Of the 511 subjects with a positive questionnaire, 349 (68.3 %) tested positive for autoantibodies and were sent to the rheumatology unit for evaluation. The prevalence of the different rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for RA (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for SLE, 0.31 % for Sjögren ’ s syndrome (16/5232), 0.3 % for primary APS (14/5232) and 0.11 % for other miscellaneous causes (two subjects with systemic sclerosis, one with mixed connective tissue disease one with Wegener syndrome and one with monoarticular arthritis). The overall prevalence of major connective tissue disease was 1.3 % (68/5232). UCTD was the most common unrecognized rheumatologic disorder and was diagnosed in 2.5 % (131/5232) of subjects. Finally, 150 out of the 349 subjects with symptoms and autoantibodies (43 %) had insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of a definite rheumatic disease.\nTable 2 reports the distribution of symptoms and auto- immune antibodies in the groups studied. More than 50 % of women with UCTD or a with major rheumatic disease reported three or more symptoms; on the other hand, 5.4 % of controls tested positive for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:80 or more. Photosensitivity and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon were the most common symp- toms among subjects diagnosed with UCTD (73/131 and 92/131) and those without a definite diagnosis (85/150 and 78/150, respectively). Of the 150 subjects without a definite diagnosis, 116 ANA (77.3 %) positive subjects had a clinical picture resembling UCTD but with symp- toms lasting less than 3 years, whereas the remaining 34 (22.7 %) had an incomplete picture of a major rheumatic disease.\nAfter the first trimester of pregnancy, corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine were given to 23 (17.6 %) women with UCTD and to 20 (29.4 %) with a definite connective tissue disease. After a definite rheumatological diagnosis, low-molecular dose heparin and/or aspirin were administered in 18 (26.5 %) and 42 (61.8 %) of subjects with major rheumatic diseases and 15 (11.5 %) and 48 (36.6 %) of those with UCTD, respectively. Overall, among the 199 women with a definite rheumatic disease, heparin was given to 26 (13.1 %) subjects with primary or second- ary APS and to 7 (3.5 %) women with a previous throm- botic events.\nInfants born to subjects with rheumatic symptoms, irrespective of diagnosis, had a lower gestational age and birthweight than controls (Table 3). In the post-hoc analysis, and after Bonferroni correction, gestational age and birthweight among subjects with a major rheumatic disease were lower when compared to the UCTD group ( p = 0.05 for both comparisons) and to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.001 and p = 0.012 for gesta- tional age and birthweight, respectively). Nulliparity was more common among controls than in any category of rheumatologic disorder ( p &lt;0.05 for all comparisons), whereas a previous low-birthweight infant was more common among subjects with a major rheumatic disease than in controls.\nIncreased placental vascular resistance, as suggested by increased pulsatility indices in the first and second trimester uterine artery and third trimester umbilical artery, were higher in all the categories of rheumatic disorders, including subjects without a definite diagno- sis, than in controls ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons in the post-hoc analysis) (Table 4). Umbilical artery PI was also higher among major rheumatic diseases when compared to either UCTD ( p = 0.009) or to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p = 0.017). These results were also confirmed in the categorical analysis since the rates of first and second trimester uterine artery bilateral notches\nTable 2 Number of positive questionnaire answers and autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nTable 3 Main demographic variables autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nand third trimester umbilical artery PI &gt; 95 th percentile were higher among all categories of rheumatic disorders than in controls ( p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). In the partition of the chi-square analysis, compared to the negative controls, the rates of preeclampsia or FGR were more common among all categories of rheumatic disor- ders, including subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons). Finally, the rates of SGA infants were higher among patients with major rheumatic diseases ( p &lt;0.001) and UCTD ( p = 0.007) than in controls. Table 5 reports the results of the logistic regression analysis. Putative risk factors for preeclampsia and/or fetal growth failure that differed among cases and con- trols at p ≤ 0.1 level (nulliparity, first trimester smoking, previous low birthweight infant and chronic hyperten- sion) were inserted in the model as confounders. The likelihood of either FGR or preeclampsia was five times higher among subjects with defined rheumatic disorders, either UCTD or a major systemic disease, than in con- trols. The odds ratio of these two outcomes was also higher in subjects with a definite diagnosis of a rheu- matic disease than in those with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis ( p = 0.028). Overall, unrecognized rheumatic diseases, major or UCTD, were associated with an excess incidence of 3.9 cases per 100 subjects (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6), or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of either preeclampsia or FGR.\nThe overall adjusted prevalence of SGA in the popula- tion studied was 11.1 % (95 % CI = 9.2 – 13.2) (104/941). Major rheumatic diseases and UCTD were associated with an excess risk of SGA of 1.4 % (95 % CI = 0.6 – 2.1) and 1.3 % (95 % CI = 0.4 – 2.3), and with attributable fractions of 12.3 % (95 % CI = 5.2 – 18.8) and 12.5 % (95 % CI = 3.5 – 20.4), respectively. Overall, previously unrecognized rheumatic diseases, either major or UCTD, were associated with a significantly increased risk of SGA (OR = 3.1, 95 % CI = 1.96 – 4.95) and with an excess risk of 2.7 cases (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study have shown that unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune rheumatic disorders are rather common during the first trimester of pregnancy and are associated with a significant number of pre- eclampsia and fetal growth restriction cases. In parti- cular, the 1.3 % rate of definite rheumatic diseases detected during the first trimester of pregnancy was responsible for 15 % of all cases of preeclampsia or IUGR and for 12 % of all cases of SGA. After the inclu- sion of the 2.5 % rate of UCTD detected during the first trimester, unrecognized rheumatic disorders were respon- sible for up to 25 % of SGA and up to 34 % of preeclamp- sia/IUGR cases in our population. The strengths of this\nTable 4 Maternal and fetal Doppler velocimetry, and main obstetric outcomes among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nstudy include the prospective design, the methods used and the number of subjects recruited. Previous retro- spective studies have suggested that a clinical history of reproductive failure, preeclampsia, prematurity or FGR increases the subsequent risk of a diagnosis of rheumatic disease [22]. This association has prompted several authors to postulate a causal association between adverse reproductive events and subsequent occurrence of rheu- matic diseases such as RA or SLE [23]. Although the potential interference of pregnancy-associated hormonal and metabolic modifications on the subsequent occur- rence of rheumatic diseases cannot be entirely excluded, other retrospective studies suggest that a poor reproduc- tive outcome is rather a comorbidity of the long precli- nical phase of some rheumatic diseases rather than a true causative factor [3, 6, 7]. Our longitudinal data show that adverse obstetric events are common, not only among women with unrecognized rheumatic diseases with a definite diagnosis, but also among undifferentiated or even “ early ” rheumatic disorders which, without screening mea- sures, would have been undetected.\nPotential selection biases are the main limitations of the study. We used a two-step screening approach including a self-administered questionnaire and subsequent autoanti- body detection, which in a pilot study demonstrated excel- lent detection rates of rheumatic disease [8]. In addition,\nthe validity of a similar approach has been extensively confirmed in the diagnosis of RA, SLE and Sjögren ’ s syn- drome both in Europe and in other countries [11 – 16]. The rate of false negatives using this method is very low [8]; thus, the prevalence rates detected in our study should not be biased by underdiagnosis. In addition, to avoid overdiagnosis, we used standard definitions for the diag- nosis of RA, SLE, Sjögren ’ s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, APS and UCTD and rheumatological clinical assessments were repeated monthly during pregnancy. The overall rate of definite rheumatic diseases and UCTD in our study is consistent with the 5 % rate of major rheumatic diseases reported in the general population [1, 3], however, since recruitment took place in a public hospital, we cannot exclude a potential selection bias based on low socio- economic status. Definite rheumatic diseases such as RA, SLE or Sjögren ’ s syndrome can be unrecognized or un- diagnosed for long periods of time because the symptoms and signs are not specific and a precise diagnosis can be difficult to achieve [2 – 4]. Moreover, the natural history of these disorders follows a pattern of progression lasting from months to years, from a preclinical non-diagnostic phase to overt clinical disease [2, 3, 24]. Establishing the exact moment of transition from the preclinical to clinical phases is difficult; thus, in the general population, rheumatic diseases can be detected at various stages of\n\n\nTable 5 Crude incidence, odds ratio, population attributable risk and population attributable fraction of preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR) in the population studied after excluding subjects with spontaneous abortions\nFetal growth restriction (FGR)\nUCTD undifferentiated connective tissue disease\nOdds ratios (OR), population attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable fraction obtained by logistic regression analysis containing preeclampsia and/or FGR as outcomes and category of rheumatic disorders (controls, major rheumatic diseases, UCTD, no criteria for diagnosis), nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), chronic hypertension (yes, no) and previous low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant (yes, no) as explanatory variables. The analysis was carried out in 941 viable pregnancies\ndevelopment [24]. For these reasons, the 1.3 % rate of well-defined rheumatic disease in our population was not surprising. UCTD, defined as the presence of at least one clinical manifestation of a major rheumatic disease lasting at least 3 years and a positive ANA result, was the most frequent rheumatic disorder detected in our subjects. Although the risk of preeclampsia and fetal growth restric- tion associated with UCTD was lower than that associated with major rheumatic diseases, the burden of pregnancy complications associated with these two disorders was similar. The group of subjects with UCTD probably includes either women in the preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease or women with a stable mild rheumatic disorder [25]. Whatever the composition of this group of rheumatic disorders, our results confirm preliminary data showing that UCTD is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [26]. According to Mosca et al., [27], the group of subjects with no criteria for a definite diagnosis of a rheumatic disease probably contains subjects in the early phase of stable UCTD as well as subjects at an early phase or in a true preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease. Although, in our study, the impact of this condition on the incidence of FGR or preeclampsia was considerably lower than that of either UCTD or major rheumatic diseases, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in these subjects than in negative controls.\nInadequate trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries with a subsequent defective establishment of maternal- fetal vascularization and oxygen and nutrient exchange is considered the probable mechanism underlying the adverse effect of rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcomes [27]. A direct effect of maternal autoantibodies on trophoblast invasiveness as well as maternal proinflam- matory status and endothelial dysfunction seem to medi- ate defective placentation among subjects with rheumatic disorders [27]. The results of our study confirm these suggestions. In fact, we found increased second trimester pulsatility indices and bilateral notching of uterine arteries in all categories of rheumatic disorders compared to controls. These Doppler findings are associated with inad- equate trophoblast invasion of myometrial spiral arteries, leading to an increased risk of preeclampsia and FGR [23, 27]. A vascular mechanism could also be postulated for the adverse effect of preclinical rheumatic diseases on pregnancy outcome. In fact, it has been demonstrated that autoantibodies related to pre-disease stages could increase the risk of peripheral vascular damage, leading to accele- rated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [5].\nThe rate of unrecognized rheumatic disorders in the general population could be affected by the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the population and by the time and the frequency of contact with the health care system. For these reasons, our results cannot be generalized to\nother populations. However, given their long and often unpredictable natural history, it is likely that in the general population of countries with a high incidence of rheu- matic disorders, a significant proportion of subjects in the preclinical stage of these diseases can go undetected for a long period of time. The identification of this group of subjects early during pregnancy could lead to a timely treatment of rheumatic disorders and also to a prevention of pregnancy complications [28].\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate that a first trimester detailed history on symptoms suggesting a systemic connective tissue disease can be useful in the early detection of a previ- ously undiagnosed systemic rheumatic disease. Screen- ing measures for rheumatic disorders have the potential to improve both disease outcomes and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and adverse reproductive consequences [3, 29]. However, factors regulating the performance of a screening approach such as tests to be used, the population to be tested, the magnitude of net benefits and the harms associated with screening for rheumatic disorders are still uncertain [2 – 4]. Future studies may clarify if screening programs are applicable to populations at risk and whether the identification of subjects with rheumatic disorders at various stages of the disease could translate to a better prognosis and the prevention of associated comorbidities such as preg- nancy complications.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nANA: Antinuclear antibody (ANA); APS: Anti-phospholipid syndrome; ENA: Anti-extractable nuclear antigen; FGR: Fetal growth retsriction; PI: Pulsatility index; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; SGA: Small for gestational age; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematous; UCTD: Uundifferentiated connective tissue disease\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant Ricerca Corrente 2012 .

Systemic rheumatic diseases are characterized by a long natural history with few symptoms, an undifferentiated picture or a remitting course making difficult a timely diagnosis. It has been suggested that screening measures for these diseases could be useful but the impact of unrecognized systemic rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcome is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of previously unrecognized systemic autoimmune rheumatic on the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR).\nMethods: A longitudinal cohort-study with enrolment during the first trimester of pregnancy of women attending routine antenatal care using a two-step approach with a self-reported questionnaire, autoantibody detection and clinical evaluation of antibody-positive subjects. The incidence of FGR and preeclampsia in subjects with newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was compared to that of selected negative controls adjusting for potential confounders by logistic regression analysis.\nResults: The prevalence of previously unrecognized systemic rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for rheumatoid arthritis (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for systemic lupus erythematosus, 0.31 % (16/5232) for Sjögren ’ s syndrome, 0.3 % for primary antiphospholipid syndrome (14/5232) and 0.11 % (6/5232) for other miscellaneous diseases.\nUndifferentiated connective tissue disease was diagnosed in an additional 131 subjects (2.5 %). The incidence of either FGR or preeclampsia was 6.1 % (36/594) among controls and 25.3 % (50/198) in subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (excess incidence = 3.9 % (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6) or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of FGR/preeclampsia). The incidence of small for gestational age infant (SGA) was higher among subjects with unrecognized rheumatic diseases (41/198 as compared to 46/594; adjOdds Ratio = 3.1, 95 % CI =1.96 – 4.95) than in controls. The excess incidence associated with unrecognized rheumatic diseases was 2.7 % (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.

It has been estimated that approximately one in 12 women will develop a definite inflammatory rheumatic disease during her lifetime [1]. In addition, establishing and emerging data suggest that the natural history of RA, SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic disease encompasses a so-called preclinical disease phase lasting from months to several years and characterized by little or no clinical find- ings and by the presence of detectable autoimmune anti- bodies [2, 3]. These data suggest that autoantibodies and autoimmune rheumatic diseases at various stages of deve- lopment, often unrecognized or undiagnosed, are much more common in the general population than previously recognized [3, 4]. Systemic rheumatic disorders or the preclinical stages of these diseases are not entirely benign and have been associated with increased risks of subcli- nical atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and lung diseases [2, 5]. In addition, several studies have shown that higher than expected rates of reproductive failures, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia occur before the clinical occurrence or the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [6, 7], suggesting a potential causal role of unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune disorders in the occurrence of pregnancy complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously unrecognized autoimmune rheumatic disorders during pregnancy and to measure their impact on the incidence of fetal growth failure and preeclampsia.\n\n\nMethods\nSubjects for the study were recruited among unselected pregnant women who obtained antenatal care at our Department during the first trimester of pregnancy. As this was a cohort pilot study involving only a few mem- bers of staff, we restricted the enrolment to all women attending the clinic for antenatal care each Monday during a 6-year period (May 2009 to June 2014). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of our Department (Procedure n.20110034530). Enrolment criteria included: a) singleton pregnancy; b) antenatal care and\ndelivery at our Department; c) fluency in the Italian language; d) no previous diagnosis or treatment of connective tissue diseases; e) absence of fetal malformations or chromosomal anomalies. The characteristics of the study and the validation of the methods used have been already reported elsewhere [8]. Briefly, after informed consent and before the medical evaluation, each woman was asked to complete a screening questionnaire including any connective tissue disorder symptoms (Table 1). Women who answered positively to one or more of the questions were tested for the presence of circulating autoantibodies, including antinuclear anti- body (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), anticardiolipin antibody, anti- β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (a β 2GPI) and lupus anticoa- gulant, according to standardized methods, as previously described [9]. The ANA test was considered positive at a titer ≥ 1:80. To ensure random sampling, the first three subjects with negative responses to all the items in the questionnaire after each index case diagnosed with a rheumatic disease (major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases) and willing to participate in the study were tested for autoantibodies and served as the control. Cases and controls were referred to the rheumatology unit of our hospital for further clinical assessment including a careful history and a physical examination. Rheumato- logists were unaware of the results of the questionnaires. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide anti- bodies were not included in the screening autoantibody profile, but were tested only in patients with arthritis after\n\n\nTable 1 Ten-item questionnaire administered\n1.

Rheumatic diseases were classified according to widely used criteria for undifferen- tiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) [10], RA [11], SLE [12], anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) [13], Sjögren ’ s syndrome [14], systemic sclerosis [15], polymyo- sitis/dermatomyositis [16] and mixed connective tissue disease [17]. Patients with suspected rheumatic disease (symptoms plus autoantibodies) but not fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were classified as the no criteria for diagnosis group. Monthly rheumatological clinical assessment during pregnancy was carried out in subjects with major or undifferentiated connective tissue diseases and in those without criteria for a definite diagnosis.\nAfter Ist trimester enrolment, gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound, and cases and controls were followed-up with monthly obstetric clinical and ultrasono- graphic evaluations. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in the first and second trimester was evaluated according to standard methods [18]. Pulsatility indices of uterine or umbilical arteries were considered abnormal when the values were higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves [18]. FGR was diagnosed when the abdominal fetal circumference at ultrasonographic exam- ination fell below the 10 th percentile of our local reference curves, confirmed on at least two consecutive measure- ments taken 2 weeks apart after the standard US obtained at 18 – 22 weeks of pregnancy, and PI of umbilical artery was higher than the 95 th percentile of reference curves sig- naling a reduced perfusion of fetal placental unit. Pre- eclampsia was diagnosed according to standard criteria [19]. Small for gestational age infants were diagnosed when birth weight was below the 10 th percentile of the Italian population [20].\nStatistical analyses were carried out with one-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare continuous variables between the groups stud- ied. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson ’ s χ 2 . Partitioning of χ 2 statistics with the Bonferroni correc- tion for multiple comparisons was used to evaluate the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons in two × K tables. Associations between the diagnostic category of the rheumatic disorder and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression analysis by computing odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders (Stata 12.0 for Windows. (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\nLogistic models included complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, FGR, SGA) as outcome variables and nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), pre- vious history of low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant, chronic hypertension (yes, no) and the diagnostic category of the autoimmune rheumatic disease (major rheumatic disease, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, no criteria for diagnosis) as explanatory variables. Logistic regression was\nalso used to compute the percent excess incidence (percent population attributable risk) and the percent frac- tion of outcome (percent population attributable fraction) associated with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [21].\n\n\nResults\nOut of the 5451 eligible subjects enrolled during the period of the study, 5232 (96 %) gave their consent and completed the questionnaire. The rate of positivity to one or more questions was 9.8 % (511/5232). Of the 511 subjects with a positive questionnaire, 349 (68.3 %) tested positive for autoantibodies and were sent to the rheumatology unit for evaluation. The prevalence of the different rheumatic diseases was 0.4 % for RA (19/5232), 0.25 % (13/5232) for SLE, 0.31 % for Sjögren ’ s syndrome (16/5232), 0.3 % for primary APS (14/5232) and 0.11 % for other miscellaneous causes (two subjects with systemic sclerosis, one with mixed connective tissue disease one with Wegener syndrome and one with monoarticular arthritis). The overall prevalence of major connective tissue disease was 1.3 % (68/5232). UCTD was the most common unrecognized rheumatologic disorder and was diagnosed in 2.5 % (131/5232) of subjects. Finally, 150 out of the 349 subjects with symptoms and autoantibodies (43 %) had insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of a definite rheumatic disease.\nTable 2 reports the distribution of symptoms and auto- immune antibodies in the groups studied. More than 50 % of women with UCTD or a with major rheumatic disease reported three or more symptoms; on the other hand, 5.4 % of controls tested positive for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:80 or more. Photosensitivity and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon were the most common symp- toms among subjects diagnosed with UCTD (73/131 and 92/131) and those without a definite diagnosis (85/150 and 78/150, respectively). Of the 150 subjects without a definite diagnosis, 116 ANA (77.3 %) positive subjects had a clinical picture resembling UCTD but with symp- toms lasting less than 3 years, whereas the remaining 34 (22.7 %) had an incomplete picture of a major rheumatic disease.\nAfter the first trimester of pregnancy, corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine were given to 23 (17.6 %) women with UCTD and to 20 (29.4 %) with a definite connective tissue disease. After a definite rheumatological diagnosis, low-molecular dose heparin and/or aspirin were administered in 18 (26.5 %) and 42 (61.8 %) of subjects with major rheumatic diseases and 15 (11.5 %) and 48 (36.6 %) of those with UCTD, respectively. Overall, among the 199 women with a definite rheumatic disease, heparin was given to 26 (13.1 %) subjects with primary or second- ary APS and to 7 (3.5 %) women with a previous throm- botic events.\nInfants born to subjects with rheumatic symptoms, irrespective of diagnosis, had a lower gestational age and birthweight than controls (Table 3). In the post-hoc analysis, and after Bonferroni correction, gestational age and birthweight among subjects with a major rheumatic disease were lower when compared to the UCTD group ( p = 0.05 for both comparisons) and to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.001 and p = 0.012 for gesta- tional age and birthweight, respectively). Nulliparity was more common among controls than in any category of rheumatologic disorder ( p &lt;0.05 for all comparisons), whereas a previous low-birthweight infant was more common among subjects with a major rheumatic disease than in controls.\nIncreased placental vascular resistance, as suggested by increased pulsatility indices in the first and second trimester uterine artery and third trimester umbilical artery, were higher in all the categories of rheumatic disorders, including subjects without a definite diagno- sis, than in controls ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons in the post-hoc analysis) (Table 4). Umbilical artery PI was also higher among major rheumatic diseases when compared to either UCTD ( p = 0.009) or to subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p = 0.017). These results were also confirmed in the categorical analysis since the rates of first and second trimester uterine artery bilateral notches\nTable 2 Number of positive questionnaire answers and autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nTable 3 Main demographic variables autoantibodies among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nand third trimester umbilical artery PI &gt; 95 th percentile were higher among all categories of rheumatic disorders than in controls ( p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). In the partition of the chi-square analysis, compared to the negative controls, the rates of preeclampsia or FGR were more common among all categories of rheumatic disor- ders, including subjects without a definite diagnosis ( p &lt;0.01 for all comparisons). Finally, the rates of SGA infants were higher among patients with major rheumatic diseases ( p &lt;0.001) and UCTD ( p = 0.007) than in controls. Table 5 reports the results of the logistic regression analysis. Putative risk factors for preeclampsia and/or fetal growth failure that differed among cases and con- trols at p ≤ 0.1 level (nulliparity, first trimester smoking, previous low birthweight infant and chronic hyperten- sion) were inserted in the model as confounders. The likelihood of either FGR or preeclampsia was five times higher among subjects with defined rheumatic disorders, either UCTD or a major systemic disease, than in con- trols. The odds ratio of these two outcomes was also higher in subjects with a definite diagnosis of a rheu- matic disease than in those with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis ( p = 0.028). Overall, unrecognized rheumatic diseases, major or UCTD, were associated with an excess incidence of 3.9 cases per 100 subjects (95 % CI = 2.6 – 9.6), or 34 % (95 % CI = 22 – 44) of all cases of either preeclampsia or FGR.\nThe overall adjusted prevalence of SGA in the popula- tion studied was 11.1 % (95 % CI = 9.2 – 13.2) (104/941). Major rheumatic diseases and UCTD were associated with an excess risk of SGA of 1.4 % (95 % CI = 0.6 – 2.1) and 1.3 % (95 % CI = 0.4 – 2.3), and with attributable fractions of 12.3 % (95 % CI = 5.2 – 18.8) and 12.5 % (95 % CI = 3.5 – 20.4), respectively. Overall, previously unrecognized rheumatic diseases, either major or UCTD, were associated with a significantly increased risk of SGA (OR = 3.1, 95 % CI = 1.96 – 4.95) and with an excess risk of 2.7 cases (95 % CI = 1.5 – 4) or 25 % (95 % CI = 12.8 – 34.8) of all SGA cases.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study have shown that unrecognized or undiagnosed autoimmune rheumatic disorders are rather common during the first trimester of pregnancy and are associated with a significant number of pre- eclampsia and fetal growth restriction cases. In parti- cular, the 1.3 % rate of definite rheumatic diseases detected during the first trimester of pregnancy was responsible for 15 % of all cases of preeclampsia or IUGR and for 12 % of all cases of SGA. After the inclu- sion of the 2.5 % rate of UCTD detected during the first trimester, unrecognized rheumatic disorders were respon- sible for up to 25 % of SGA and up to 34 % of preeclamp- sia/IUGR cases in our population. The strengths of this\nTable 4 Maternal and fetal Doppler velocimetry, and main obstetric outcomes among controls and subjects with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), major rheumatic diseases and no criteria for diagnosis\nstudy include the prospective design, the methods used and the number of subjects recruited. Previous retro- spective studies have suggested that a clinical history of reproductive failure, preeclampsia, prematurity or FGR increases the subsequent risk of a diagnosis of rheumatic disease [22]. This association has prompted several authors to postulate a causal association between adverse reproductive events and subsequent occurrence of rheu- matic diseases such as RA or SLE [23]. Although the potential interference of pregnancy-associated hormonal and metabolic modifications on the subsequent occur- rence of rheumatic diseases cannot be entirely excluded, other retrospective studies suggest that a poor reproduc- tive outcome is rather a comorbidity of the long precli- nical phase of some rheumatic diseases rather than a true causative factor [3, 6, 7]. Our longitudinal data show that adverse obstetric events are common, not only among women with unrecognized rheumatic diseases with a definite diagnosis, but also among undifferentiated or even “ early ” rheumatic disorders which, without screening mea- sures, would have been undetected.\nPotential selection biases are the main limitations of the study. We used a two-step screening approach including a self-administered questionnaire and subsequent autoanti- body detection, which in a pilot study demonstrated excel- lent detection rates of rheumatic disease [8]. In addition,\nthe validity of a similar approach has been extensively confirmed in the diagnosis of RA, SLE and Sjögren ’ s syn- drome both in Europe and in other countries [11 – 16]. The rate of false negatives using this method is very low [8]; thus, the prevalence rates detected in our study should not be biased by underdiagnosis. In addition, to avoid overdiagnosis, we used standard definitions for the diag- nosis of RA, SLE, Sjögren ’ s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, APS and UCTD and rheumatological clinical assessments were repeated monthly during pregnancy. The overall rate of definite rheumatic diseases and UCTD in our study is consistent with the 5 % rate of major rheumatic diseases reported in the general population [1, 3], however, since recruitment took place in a public hospital, we cannot exclude a potential selection bias based on low socio- economic status. Definite rheumatic diseases such as RA, SLE or Sjögren ’ s syndrome can be unrecognized or un- diagnosed for long periods of time because the symptoms and signs are not specific and a precise diagnosis can be difficult to achieve [2 – 4]. Moreover, the natural history of these disorders follows a pattern of progression lasting from months to years, from a preclinical non-diagnostic phase to overt clinical disease [2, 3, 24]. Establishing the exact moment of transition from the preclinical to clinical phases is difficult; thus, in the general population, rheumatic diseases can be detected at various stages of\n\n\nTable 5 Crude incidence, odds ratio, population attributable risk and population attributable fraction of preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR) in the population studied after excluding subjects with spontaneous abortions\nFetal growth restriction (FGR)\nUCTD undifferentiated connective tissue disease\nOdds ratios (OR), population attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable fraction obtained by logistic regression analysis containing preeclampsia and/or FGR as outcomes and category of rheumatic disorders (controls, major rheumatic diseases, UCTD, no criteria for diagnosis), nulliparity (yes, no), first trimester smoking (yes, no), chronic hypertension (yes, no) and previous low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) infant (yes, no) as explanatory variables. The analysis was carried out in 941 viable pregnancies\ndevelopment [24]. For these reasons, the 1.3 % rate of well-defined rheumatic disease in our population was not surprising. UCTD, defined as the presence of at least one clinical manifestation of a major rheumatic disease lasting at least 3 years and a positive ANA result, was the most frequent rheumatic disorder detected in our subjects. Although the risk of preeclampsia and fetal growth restric- tion associated with UCTD was lower than that associated with major rheumatic diseases, the burden of pregnancy complications associated with these two disorders was similar. The group of subjects with UCTD probably includes either women in the preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease or women with a stable mild rheumatic disorder [25]. Whatever the composition of this group of rheumatic disorders, our results confirm preliminary data showing that UCTD is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [26]. According to Mosca et al., [27], the group of subjects with no criteria for a definite diagnosis of a rheumatic disease probably contains subjects in the early phase of stable UCTD as well as subjects at an early phase or in a true preclinical stage of a major rheumatic disease. Although, in our study, the impact of this condition on the incidence of FGR or preeclampsia was considerably lower than that of either UCTD or major rheumatic diseases, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in these subjects than in negative controls.\nInadequate trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries with a subsequent defective establishment of maternal- fetal vascularization and oxygen and nutrient exchange is considered the probable mechanism underlying the adverse effect of rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcomes [27]. A direct effect of maternal autoantibodies on trophoblast invasiveness as well as maternal proinflam- matory status and endothelial dysfunction seem to medi- ate defective placentation among subjects with rheumatic disorders [27]. The results of our study confirm these suggestions. In fact, we found increased second trimester pulsatility indices and bilateral notching of uterine arteries in all categories of rheumatic disorders compared to controls. These Doppler findings are associated with inad- equate trophoblast invasion of myometrial spiral arteries, leading to an increased risk of preeclampsia and FGR [23, 27]. A vascular mechanism could also be postulated for the adverse effect of preclinical rheumatic diseases on pregnancy outcome. In fact, it has been demonstrated that autoantibodies related to pre-disease stages could increase the risk of peripheral vascular damage, leading to accele- rated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [5].\nThe rate of unrecognized rheumatic disorders in the general population could be affected by the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the population and by the time and the frequency of contact with the health care system. For these reasons, our results cannot be generalized to\nother populations. However, given their long and often unpredictable natural history, it is likely that in the general population of countries with a high incidence of rheu- matic disorders, a significant proportion of subjects in the preclinical stage of these diseases can go undetected for a long period of time. The identification of this group of subjects early during pregnancy could lead to a timely treatment of rheumatic disorders and also to a prevention of pregnancy complications [28].\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data indicate that a first trimester detailed history on symptoms suggesting a systemic connective tissue disease can be useful in the early detection of a previ- ously undiagnosed systemic rheumatic disease. Screen- ing measures for rheumatic disorders have the potential to improve both disease outcomes and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and adverse reproductive consequences [3, 29]. However, factors regulating the performance of a screening approach such as tests to be used, the population to be tested, the magnitude of net benefits and the harms associated with screening for rheumatic disorders are still uncertain [2 – 4]. Future studies may clarify if screening programs are applicable to populations at risk and whether the identification of subjects with rheumatic disorders at various stages of the disease could translate to a better prognosis and the prevention of associated comorbidities such as preg- nancy complications.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nANA: Antinuclear antibody (ANA); APS: Anti-phospholipid syndrome; ENA: Anti-extractable nuclear antigen; FGR: Fetal growth retsriction; PI: Pulsatility index; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; SGA: Small for gestational age; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematous; UCTD: Uundifferentiated connective tissue disease\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant Ricerca Corrente 2012 .

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective time-to-event study of the clinical manifestations associated with PRKAG2 mutations.\nMethods and results A cohort of 34 patients from 9 families was recruited between 2001 and 2010. DNA were sequenced on all exons and flanking sequences of the PRKAG2 gene using Sanger sequencing. Overall, four families carried the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and the five others carried private mutations among which three had never been reported. In the total cohort, at 40 years of age, the risk of developing HCM was 61%, VPE 70%, conduction block 22%, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 20%. The global survival at 60 years of age was 66%. Thirty-two per cent of patients ( N ¼ 10) required a device implant- ation (5 pacemakers and 5 defibrillators) at a median age of 66 years, and two patients required heart transplant. Only one patient presented with significant skeletal muscle symptoms. No significant differences regarding the occurrence of VPE, ablation complications, or death incidence were observed between different mutations.\nConclusion This study of patients with PRKAG2 mutations provides a more comprehensive view of the natural history of this disease and demonstrates a high risk of cardiac complications. Early recognition of this disease appears important to allow an appropriate management.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keywords Cardiomyopathy † Time-to-event study † PRKAG2 † Wolff – Parkinson – White † Ventricular pre-excitation\n* Corresponding author.

A genetic ori- gin can be identified in 40 – 60% of HCM, usually with an auto- somal dominant mode of inheritance and most of the culprit genes are coding for sarcomeric proteins implicated in myofibrillar performance. 1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular pre-excitation (VPE) or the Wolff – Parkinson – White (WPW) syndrome suggests particular aetiologies such as a metabol- ic disorder. 2 In a case series of 150 histological examinations of HCM with VPE, 12% of cases were known storage disorders, 3 in- cluding lysosomal diseases (Pompe, Fabry, and Danon diseases) or classical glycogenosis (type III and IV glycogenosis). 3 – 6 Apart from those disorders, often associated with systemic symptoms, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 is a remarkable entity. 7 – 9\nThe PRKAG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK. 7\nThis protein is an ubiquitous sensor of the cellular energetic balance. More specifically, PRKAG2 is expressed in muscle cells, and PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an excess of glycogen in those tis- sues. 10 Interestingly, the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK may partici- pate to cardiac development and specifically to the atrioventricular (AV) annulus fibrosus development. 11 – 14 Contrasting with the sar- comeric HCM aetiologies, mutations of PRKAG2 are known to cause an energetic disease affecting cardiac muscle. 9 Following the identi- fication of mutations in PRKAG2 in 2001, 150 patients have been reported so far. Half of the cases were carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and a dozen of other non-recurrent muta- tions were listed. 15 – 18 Besides the clinical hallmarks of patients car- rying mutations in PRKAG2 , namely HCM and VPE, rarely patients were reported with myopathic symptoms, suggesting the existence of scarce extra-cardiac symptoms. 9 , 19 To date, there are no pub- lished data assessing the ‘time-to-event’ clinical manifestations, com- plications, and survival in the patients with mutations in PRKAG2 gene. Hence, the management of patients is strongly limited by poor information on natural history. The aim of these retrospective time-to-event study was to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, (iii) the genotype – phenotype correlation between patients carrying\nthe recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation compared with patients with other mutations.\n\n\nMethods\nStudy population and diagnostic criteria\nIn this retrospective study, we gathered the clinical data from the pa- tients diagnosed with disease-causing mutations of PRKAG2 diagnosed in the French molecular laboratory for inherited cardiac disorders at Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re hospital between 2001 and 2010.\nIndications for the genetic test were (i) a family history of SCD (two or more cases), (ii) an echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM [interventri- cular septum (IVS) of 15 mm or more], (iii) HCM with VPE, and (iv) a family history of VPE (two or more cases). Most of the electrocardio- gram (ECG) tracings and electrophysiological (EP) testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist.\nA short PR interval was diagnosed on an ECG when , 120 ms. We considered that patients had a genuine WPW syndrome when a short PR interval was associated with a delta wave and an enlarged QRS com- plex. Patients with isolated short PR interval were classified as VPE non-WPW syndrome.\n\n\nGenetic testing\nOverall, 120 patients with HCM + VPE ( N ¼ 60), HCM + WPW ( N ¼ 30), and isolated WPW ( N ¼ 30) were screened for PRKAG2 mutations by means of Sanger sequencing (RefSeq PRKAG2 : NM_016203.3). Chro- matographs were analysed with the SeqScape software (Applied Biosys- tems w ). For new variants, the pathogenicity was concluded when the variant (i) co-segregated with the phenotype in the family; (ii) was absent from public database of healthy human variants ( http://exac.broadinstitute. org/ ; http://evs.gs.washington.edu ); and (iii) predicted to be damaging by at least three of the following bioinformatics prediction software: Polyphen2, Mutation taster, SIFT, and GVGD and changed the physico-chemical property of the reference amino acid (Grantham score).\n\n\nQuestionnaires\nA questionnaire was designed and sent to the referring clinicians of the 34 patients. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (i) diag- nostic circumstances and initial presentation; (ii) cardiac symptoms with details on imaging and rhythmic evaluations; and (iii) extra-cardiac man- ifestations of the disease, especially myopathy symptoms.\n\n\nMyocardial and muscle biopsies\nTwo patients had an endomyocardial biopsy during the etiological workup: one underwent a heart transplant with a macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the explanted heart, and the other had a muscle biopsy for diagnostic purpose. Standard haematoxylin-eosin (HES) and periodic acid – Schiff (PAS) staining were performed.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all time-to-event analyses, the baseline date (time zero) was the date of birth. In order to describe the evolution of clinical features over time, time to event was defined as the interval between birth and the event of interest (occurrence of symptoms or death). Subjects who did not ex- perience the event during their follow-up were censored at their last follow-up. To test the heterogeneity across families, a frailty Cox’s pro- portional hazards (PH) model estimated the effect of the mutation type on the risk of clinical lesion occurrence. Studied clinical lesions included VPE and HCM. Complications included conduction troubles [atrioven- tricular block (AVB) and sinus dysfunction] leading to pacemaker\n\n\nWhat’s new?\n† The global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening was estimated according to clinical presentation and identification of three new mutations associated with this disease.\n† The natural course of PRKAG2 syndrome was highlighted with hypertrophic and conductive complications according to a time-to-event study.\n† The extended clinical spectrum to skeletal muscle was de- scribed in some patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 , sug- gesting that myopathic symptoms could be systematically assessed in patients.\nimplantation, sudden cardiac death, and heart transplantation. Due to the small number of patients with a specific mutation, only patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation (4 families and 13 affected pa- tients) could be compared with patients carrying other mutations (5 families and 21 affected patients).\nIf heterogeneity across families was found with the frailty Cox’s PH model, the Kaplan – Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of clinical manifestations occurrence at each age. Log-rank tests were performed to compare mutation groups. For all analyses, P , 0.01 was considered significant, due to the number of tests. Stata soft- ware, version 11.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMutational spectrum\nPRKAG2 mutations were identified in 9 independent families (34 pa- tients) ( Figure 1 ). The global pickup rate was 7% but ranged from 0% in isolated HCM cases to 20% when a VPE was present (with or without HCM). The recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln (c.905G . A) was identified in 4 out of the 9 families (Families 1 – 4; 13 patients). The remaining families carried five private mutations, with four of them affecting one of the Cytathionin beta-synthase (CBS) domains (p.Ser333Pro, p.Glu506Lys, p.His530Arg, p.Ser548Pro) ( Figure 2 ). Among the six pathogenic mutations, three had never been reported: p.Ser333Pro (c.997T . C), p.Val336Ala (c.1007T . C), and p.Hi- s530Arg (c.1589A . G). All new mutations fulfilled the criteria in favour of a high probability of being pathogenic according to the clas- sical criteria for classification of genetic variants, i.e. cosegregation in all affected family members, mutant allele frequency , 0.1% in data- bases, highly conserved residues among species and in silico prediction scores in favour of pathogenicity.\n\n\nCardiac phenotype\nPedigrees and genetic status are represented in Figure 1 , and major clinical findings are summarized in Table 1 . Medical history of Families 1, 3, and 4 are summarized below as Family 2 was already published. 20 Families 5 – 9 carrying private mutations were further described except Family 7 already published. 19 Representative ECGs from patients issued from Families 4 and 8 are shown in Figure 3 .\n\n\nFamily 1: p.Arg302Gln\nPatient I-1 presented an asymmetric HCM (IVS: 18 mm) with conduction defect. He underwent a resuscitated sudden cardiac death at 40 years of age, leading to a defibrillator implantation, followed by a cardiac transplantation. His son, patient II-1, presented an antero-septal (18 mm) and posterior (16 mm) left ventricular wall hypertrophy. Holter ECG showed bradycardia with a frequency of 40 – 56 bpm. As he was 18 years old, this patient had twice a radiofrequency ablation of the VPE for a WPW syndrome.\n\n\nFamily 3: p.Arg302Gln\nThe patient was an asymptomatic man, diagnosed for a HCM with a short PR interval at the age of 17 years of age. As the PRKAG2 mu- tation arrived de novo , no relatives presented any cardiac symptoms.\n\n\nFamily 4: p.Arg302Gln\nThe index patient (II-1) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years on the basis of her ECG revealing a HCM associated with a WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 A ). After the first ablation procedure, the PR interval has prolonged, while conduction beats are still pre- excited ( Figure 3 B ). This clearly indicates that the AV node-like properties of the accessory pathway was slightly impaired. At 47 years old, she was implanted with a defibrillator after an aborted sudden cardiac death. Her mother deceased suddenly at the age of 60 years, and her brother (II-2) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years after an inaugural cardiac sudden death. Her daughter (III-1) also presented HCM with an accessory pathway.\n\n\nFamily 5: p.Glu506Lys\nAll the four affected patients harbouring this mutation presented with HCM and a VPE syndrome. All but one (II-3) patient had a WPW syndrome with a short PR interval. Two cases developed an apical hypokinesia (I-1 and II-1), once complicated by an intra- ventricular thrombus. One case presented with a supra-ventricular tachycardia episode complicated by an acute pulmonary oedema at 23 years of age. Finally, they developed a progressive hypokinetic HCM, which ended up with cardiac failure. Two patients under- went a radiofrequency ablation procedure. Both were finally im- planted with a device after the procedure [one (II-1) had a pacemaker because of severe AV conduction block; the other one (I-1) had a defibrillator implanted because of ventricular arrhythmia].\n\n\nFamily 6: p.Val336Ala\nThis three-generation family developed a severe cardiac disease. The index case (Patient I-1) was diagnosed at 35 years of age with a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 2/1 AVB when in sinus rhythm, and a severe HCM. A pacemaker was implanted at 55 years of age because of a symptomatic complete AVB. The progressive evolu- tion of the HCM required a septal alcohol ablation and led to a heart transplant at 60 years of age because of a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient died 1 year later. His two children ( patients II-1 and II-2) were diagnosed with a mild HCM at 12 and 15 years of age. At age 30, they both developed a severe HCM (IVS ¼ 30 mm) with VPE and left bundle branch block pat- terns on the ECG. They both died because of the severe evolution of their HCM to end-stage cardiac failure at 35 years of age. The third generation (Patient III-1) was marked by the diagnosis at 2 months of age of a wide QRS complex tachycardia. This young pa- tient had a HCM and an isolated short PR interval on the ECG. A device was implanted, but he died at 4 years of age because of un- controllable wide QRS tachycardia.\n\n\nFamily 8: p.Ser333Pro\nThe index case (Patient III-1) was diagnosed after an episode of syncope at 22 years of age. The ECG showed a HCM and WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 C ). Echocardiography diagnosed a mi- tral valve prolapse and an asymmetric HCM, dominant at the la- teroposterior wall of the left ventricle. After radiofrequency ablation of the VPE, the ECG showed an isolated short PR inter- val, with no delta wave or QRS enlargement. The sister of the\nindex case (Patient III-2) was diagnosed with a HCM and an iso- lated short PR interval ( Figure 3 D ). A radiofrequency ablation at- tempt of the VPE was unsuccessful and complicated by a\nhigh-degree AVB requiring a pacemaker implantation. A third case (III-2, Figure 3 E ) was diagnosed with HCM and a left bundle branch block, but without VPE.\nFigure 1 Pedigree of the nine families diagnosed with a PRKAG2 mutation. Squares, males; circles, females; filled symbols, clinically affected sub- jects; slash, deceased patient; + / 2 , mutation present at heterozygous status Index case indicated by arrow. Families 1 – 4: carriers of the recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln. Families 5 – 9: carriers of private mutations.\n\n\nFamily 9: p.His530Arg\nPatients I-1 and II-2 deceased of sudden death, when they were 29 and 30 years old, respectively. The index case (daughter of II-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation, and heart analysis showed a hypertrophied septum (25 mm). Her daughter (III-1) was diagnosed at 17 years old and is actually waiting for heart transplantation.\n\n\nCardiac and muscle histology\nThe index case of Families 1 and 4 had an endomyocardial biopsy. Histological analysis revealed normal muscle architecture. Periodic acid – Schiff staining disclosed vacuoles with increased glycogen con- tent in patient of Family 1 but was normal in patient of Family 4. One patient (Family 9; Patient III-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation with histological analysis. The heart weight was 373 g ( N : , 350 g). Left ventricle appeared thickened (25 mm), and microscopic exam- ination revealed myofibrillar disorganization with interstitial fibrosis. No PAS staining was performed. The index case of Family 8 had a muscle biopsy because of muscle exercise intolerance complains and ultra-structural analysis exhibited the presence of non- lysosomal glycogen accumulation.\n\n\nTime-to-event study\nThe probability of developing the hallmark clinical features was cal- culated at the age of 40 years ( Figure 4 ) and included the following: (i) VPE 70% (99% CI: 50 – 87%) ( Figure 4 a and b/A ) with a median age at diagnostic of 25 years [IQR (20 – 41)] and (ii) HCM 61% (99% CI: 41 – 81%) ( Figure 4 a and b/B ) with a median age of 32 years [IQR (18-NA)]. Complications occurred in 53% of patients, and the prob- ability of presenting one of the following events: conduction block leading to pacemaker implantation, SCD, defibrillator implantation, or heart transplantation at the age of 40 years, was 31% (99% CI: 16 – 53%) ( Figure 4 a and b/C ) with a median age of 51 years [IQR (38 – 60)]. Taken independently, at 40 years of age, the risk for a con- duction block occurrence was 22% (99% CI: 9 – 46%), the risk of SCD was 20% (99% CI: 8 – 42%), and the probability for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation was of 25% (99% CI: 2 – 48%). None of the paced patients presented an identified interventricular dys- synchrony during transthoracic ECG, and therefore none of them underwent an upgrading of their device to a biventricular model.\nHeart transplant was realized in 2 patients at 55 and 60 years of age. The risk of a fatal issue associated with mutations in PRKAG2 was 11% (99% CI: 4 – 30) at 40 years of age ( Figure 4 a and b/D ), the rest of patients who suffer of SCD being resuscitated. In this co- hort, the median age at death was 60 years [IQR (60 – 65)].\n\n\nGenotype – phenotype correlation\nThe occurrence of a VPE was not different between patients carry- ing the p.Arg302Gln mutation when compared with others ( P ¼ 0.53) ( Figure 4 bA ). The probability of developing a HCM was lower at a similar age in patients carrying the p.Arg302Gln mutation than the others, however, not significant ( P ¼ 0.064) ( Figure 4 bB ). There were no differences regarding overall complications ( Figure 4 bC ) as well as global survival rate ( Figure 4 bD ).\n\n\nDiscussion\nHeterozygous PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an autosomal dominant muscular glycogenosis with mainly cardiac manifestations, including VPE, conduction defects, and eventually HCM. In this study, we reported four families carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation and five families carrying private mutations, adding three novel pathogenic mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) to the literature. The PRKAG2 – p.Arg302Gln recur- rent mutation was reported in several publications. 13 , 20 It was asso- ciated with an important phenotypic variability between families and even within a same family. In our cohort, all index cases presented a short PR, but the cardiac phenotype could be either asymmetric left ventricle hypertrophy, apical hypertrophy, or biatrial hypertrophy. In patients with sarcomeric HCM, the prevalence of a short PR was not precisely known, but it seems to be not an uncommon find- ing. Nevertheless, as VPE is a common feature of storage diseases (Pompe and Danon diseases, PRKAG2 syndrome) and mitochon- drial disorders (MELAS, MERFF) and a short PR interval without pre-excitation is a common feature in the Anderson-Fabry disease, a precise evaluation of the phenotype of patients is essential.\nThrough a retrospective way, our study of 34 mutation carriers gave us the opportunity to realize a complete analysis of clinical and survival characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, and (iii) the genotype – phenotype correl- ation between patients carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln muta- tion compared with patients with other mutations.\nMolecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation seems to be recom- mended when patients are diagnosed with an HCM and a VPE, or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). 13 PRKAG2 mutation screening may be discussed as a differential diagnostic of the Fabry disease when the symptom- atology is limited to cardiac signs (the so-called Fabry cardiac vari- ant). 4 Neuromuscular and visceral manifestations are usually diagnosed in patients with the Pompe disease, Danon disease, or other rare glycogenosis. 3 , 5 , 6 They are rarely evoked as differential diagnosis in unexplained adult HCM. In some patients, MRI examin- ation may be useful in addition to ECG and echocardiography in or- der to clarify the presence of fibrosis and inflammation.\nHerein, three new mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) were added to the nine previously reported in PRKAG2 . According to the literature, most of these mutations are located in the CBS domains ( Figure 2 ) and were non-synonymous substitutions of conserved residues ( Table 2 ). The p.Glu506Lys was first described in eight patients from a Turkish family. They all presented a WPW syndrome associated with a progressive HCM leading to cardiac failure. 17 Similarly, the three patients from Family 5 harbouring this mutation, and who presented with VPE (one WPW and two isolated short PR intervals), developed a progressive HCM which ended up with cardiac failure (left ventricular ejection fraction between 35 and 40% at 40 years of age). Similarly, the p.Hi- s530Arg found in Family 9 is associated with a severe evolution to cardiac failure since the mother had heart transplantation and her\ndaughter is currently listed for heart graft. In this cohort, 6 patients (out of 24 available data) developed hypokinetic HCM with left ven- tricle ejection fraction below 40%. These six patients were concen- trated in 3 families [Family 5 (2/4), Family 6 (3/4), and Family 1(1/2)]. The associated mutations were Glu506Lys, Val336Ala, and Arg302Gln, respectively. These results evidenced a high rate of patients with HCM evolving towards severe dilated hypokinetic HCM in PRKAG2 mutation carriers (25% in our cohort) in contrast to HCM patients carrying a mutation in one of the sarcomeric genes ( 10%). In a pre- vious study, the p.Arg531Gln mutation was associated with a wide range of severity from asymptomatic adult patients to a severe ante- natal presentation with hypokinetic HCM. 15 In our limited cohort, no significant intrafamilial heterogeneity was identified except for p.Arg302Gln mutation carriers who presented with only a short\nA B C D E Figure 3 Twelve-lead ECG tracings from PRKAG2 -mutated patients.

A trend to a lower risk of developing HCM in patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln was also observed.\nIn the literature, the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 syndrome is defined upon four main studies ( Table 2 ). These studies cumulated more than 150 patients originated from 23 families. On average, 25.8% of the patients were asymptomatic, 75% developed a VPE,\nand 66.8% a HCM. Atrioventricular conduction block requiring the implantation of a device were reported in 37.4% of cases. Finally, 5.4% of cases presented with myopathic symptoms. A study on three families was performed and evaluated a global survival of 91% after 12.2 years of follow-up, although the mean age of the pa- tients was not mentioned. 13 As compared with other studies, the\nseverity of the disease in our cohort seemed higher. Overall, 12% of patients were asymptomatic, and global survival at 60 years of age was 67%. These differences may be explained by a higher mean age in our cohort. However, a familial effect may not be excluded in the study of Murphy et al. since 40 out of the 45 patients were from the same family, carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation. 9\nOne of the hallmark symptoms in the PRKAG2 syndrome is the presence of a VPE (WPW or isolated short PR interval). Atypical VPE with decremental AV conduction suggesting fasciculoventricu- lar pathways seems to be frequent in this disorder. 7 , 11 , 12 In the litera- ture, 12% of the cardiac deaths were associated with a short PR interval complication. In this cohort, a VPE was identified in 88% of cases. Most of the ECG tracings and EP testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist (19/23). A ‘genuine’ WPW syn- drome has been identified in 3/19 cases. Among the 16/19 remaining cases, an isolated short PR interval was diagnosed. When EP studies were performed, nodoventricular/fasciculoventricular (Mahaim fi- bres) or AV (para-Hisian pathways) were observed, as previously suggested. 9 , 13 Major EP differences between AV accessory pathways and nodofascicular pathways were identified. During programmed right atrial stimulation, nodofascicular pathways had a decremental AV conduction (progressive lengthening of the AH interval), with a contemporary fixed HV interval and a steady shape of the pre- existed ventricular beats. This indicated that AV conduction over the bypass had node-like properties accessory pathways. After the first ablation attempt in Patient II-1 from Family 4 ( Figure 3 B ), the PR interval was prolonged with persisting pre-existed beats meaning that the conduction through the nodofascicular pathway was slightly impaired. The implication of PRKAG2 during cardiac development and annulus fibrosus integrity may argue in favour of fasciculoventri- cular pathways in the PRKAG2 syndrome. PRKAG2 mutations were showed to be associated with the development of periganglionar secondary pathway typed as Mahaim fibres. 11 , 13 , 14 Six patients of this cohort underwent radiofrequency ablation procedures. Whereas none of them had spontaneous or induced junctional tachycardia, accessory pathways ablations were indicated because short refractory periods were identified during EP testing. Most of the accessory pathways had node-like properties and were located near the His bundle. This may explain why all of the ablated patients developed high-degree AVBs following the procedure requiring a device implantation. The absence of junctional tachycardia and the high rate of AVB complications (para-Hisian location) may also ar- gue in favour of the presence of nodoventricular/fasciculoventricu- lar type of accessory pathways.\nThese data reinforce the importance of a systematic evaluation of muscular symptoms for a better delineation of the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, molecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation should be discussed when patients are diagnosed with HCM and VPE or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). This study pointed out the severity of PRKAG2 syndrome with both myocardial and rhythm complications. The sur- vival rate was 67% at 60 years of age with an elevated penetrance of symptoms. Ablation procedures should be limited to very symp- tomatic VPE patients as pathways are mainly nodoventricular/fasci- culoventricular and therefore at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank patients and their family members for their cooperation.

Ablation is at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks. Therefore, proce- dures in these patients should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 9 In this cohort, four patients developed skeletal muscle symptoms. Three of them were complaining of moderate exercise intolerance. These symptoms did not prompt any paraclinical examination since they were attributed to a low cardiac output. The fourth patient de- veloped a muscle pain during exercise with high creatine kinase levels and was previously reported. 20 This skeletal muscle involve- ment may be associated with particular mutations. Indeed, 7/40 (18%) of patients carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation and 1/4 of pa- tients with p.Ser548Pro mutation developed muscle symptoms. 2 , 20 .... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... .....\n\n\nT able 2 Summary of clinical symptoms reported in the liter a tur e a ccording ea ch muta tion\n\n\nMut a tion NM_ 013203.3 p.Arg302Gln p.H is383Arg (p.His142Arg) p.

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective time-to-event study of the clinical manifestations associated with PRKAG2 mutations.\nMethods and results A cohort of 34 patients from 9 families was recruited between 2001 and 2010. DNA were sequenced on all exons and flanking sequences of the PRKAG2 gene using Sanger sequencing. Overall, four families carried the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and the five others carried private mutations among which three had never been reported. In the total cohort, at 40 years of age, the risk of developing HCM was 61%, VPE 70%, conduction block 22%, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 20%. The global survival at 60 years of age was 66%. Thirty-two per cent of patients ( N ¼ 10) required a device implant- ation (5 pacemakers and 5 defibrillators) at a median age of 66 years, and two patients required heart transplant. Only one patient presented with significant skeletal muscle symptoms. No significant differences regarding the occurrence of VPE, ablation complications, or death incidence were observed between different mutations.\nConclusion This study of patients with PRKAG2 mutations provides a more comprehensive view of the natural history of this disease and demonstrates a high risk of cardiac complications. Early recognition of this disease appears important to allow an appropriate management.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keywords Cardiomyopathy † Time-to-event study † PRKAG2 † Wolff – Parkinson – White † Ventricular pre-excitation\n* Corresponding author.

A genetic ori- gin can be identified in 40 – 60% of HCM, usually with an auto- somal dominant mode of inheritance and most of the culprit genes are coding for sarcomeric proteins implicated in myofibrillar performance. 1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular pre-excitation (VPE) or the Wolff – Parkinson – White (WPW) syndrome suggests particular aetiologies such as a metabol- ic disorder. 2 In a case series of 150 histological examinations of HCM with VPE, 12% of cases were known storage disorders, 3 in- cluding lysosomal diseases (Pompe, Fabry, and Danon diseases) or classical glycogenosis (type III and IV glycogenosis). 3 – 6 Apart from those disorders, often associated with systemic symptoms, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 is a remarkable entity. 7 – 9\nThe PRKAG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK. 7\nThis protein is an ubiquitous sensor of the cellular energetic balance. More specifically, PRKAG2 is expressed in muscle cells, and PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an excess of glycogen in those tis- sues. 10 Interestingly, the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK may partici- pate to cardiac development and specifically to the atrioventricular (AV) annulus fibrosus development. 11 – 14 Contrasting with the sar- comeric HCM aetiologies, mutations of PRKAG2 are known to cause an energetic disease affecting cardiac muscle. 9 Following the identi- fication of mutations in PRKAG2 in 2001, 150 patients have been reported so far. Half of the cases were carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and a dozen of other non-recurrent muta- tions were listed. 15 – 18 Besides the clinical hallmarks of patients car- rying mutations in PRKAG2 , namely HCM and VPE, rarely patients were reported with myopathic symptoms, suggesting the existence of scarce extra-cardiac symptoms. 9 , 19 To date, there are no pub- lished data assessing the ‘time-to-event’ clinical manifestations, com- plications, and survival in the patients with mutations in PRKAG2 gene. Hence, the management of patients is strongly limited by poor information on natural history. The aim of these retrospective time-to-event study was to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, (iii) the genotype – phenotype correlation between patients carrying\nthe recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation compared with patients with other mutations.\n\n\nMethods\nStudy population and diagnostic criteria\nIn this retrospective study, we gathered the clinical data from the pa- tients diagnosed with disease-causing mutations of PRKAG2 diagnosed in the French molecular laboratory for inherited cardiac disorders at Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re hospital between 2001 and 2010.\nIndications for the genetic test were (i) a family history of SCD (two or more cases), (ii) an echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM [interventri- cular septum (IVS) of 15 mm or more], (iii) HCM with VPE, and (iv) a family history of VPE (two or more cases). Most of the electrocardio- gram (ECG) tracings and electrophysiological (EP) testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist.\nA short PR interval was diagnosed on an ECG when , 120 ms. We considered that patients had a genuine WPW syndrome when a short PR interval was associated with a delta wave and an enlarged QRS com- plex. Patients with isolated short PR interval were classified as VPE non-WPW syndrome.\n\n\nGenetic testing\nOverall, 120 patients with HCM + VPE ( N ¼ 60), HCM + WPW ( N ¼ 30), and isolated WPW ( N ¼ 30) were screened for PRKAG2 mutations by means of Sanger sequencing (RefSeq PRKAG2 : NM_016203.3). Chro- matographs were analysed with the SeqScape software (Applied Biosys- tems w ). For new variants, the pathogenicity was concluded when the variant (i) co-segregated with the phenotype in the family; (ii) was absent from public database of healthy human variants ( http://exac.broadinstitute. org/ ; http://evs.gs.washington.edu ); and (iii) predicted to be damaging by at least three of the following bioinformatics prediction software: Polyphen2, Mutation taster, SIFT, and GVGD and changed the physico-chemical property of the reference amino acid (Grantham score).\n\n\nQuestionnaires\nA questionnaire was designed and sent to the referring clinicians of the 34 patients. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (i) diag- nostic circumstances and initial presentation; (ii) cardiac symptoms with details on imaging and rhythmic evaluations; and (iii) extra-cardiac man- ifestations of the disease, especially myopathy symptoms.\n\n\nMyocardial and muscle biopsies\nTwo patients had an endomyocardial biopsy during the etiological workup: one underwent a heart transplant with a macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the explanted heart, and the other had a muscle biopsy for diagnostic purpose. Standard haematoxylin-eosin (HES) and periodic acid – Schiff (PAS) staining were performed.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all time-to-event analyses, the baseline date (time zero) was the date of birth. In order to describe the evolution of clinical features over time, time to event was defined as the interval between birth and the event of interest (occurrence of symptoms or death). Subjects who did not ex- perience the event during their follow-up were censored at their last follow-up. To test the heterogeneity across families, a frailty Cox’s pro- portional hazards (PH) model estimated the effect of the mutation type on the risk of clinical lesion occurrence. Studied clinical lesions included VPE and HCM. Complications included conduction troubles [atrioven- tricular block (AVB) and sinus dysfunction] leading to pacemaker\n\n\nWhat’s new?\n† The global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening was estimated according to clinical presentation and identification of three new mutations associated with this disease.\n† The natural course of PRKAG2 syndrome was highlighted with hypertrophic and conductive complications according to a time-to-event study.\n† The extended clinical spectrum to skeletal muscle was de- scribed in some patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 , sug- gesting that myopathic symptoms could be systematically assessed in patients.\nimplantation, sudden cardiac death, and heart transplantation. Due to the small number of patients with a specific mutation, only patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation (4 families and 13 affected pa- tients) could be compared with patients carrying other mutations (5 families and 21 affected patients).\nIf heterogeneity across families was found with the frailty Cox’s PH model, the Kaplan – Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of clinical manifestations occurrence at each age. Log-rank tests were performed to compare mutation groups. For all analyses, P , 0.01 was considered significant, due to the number of tests. Stata soft- ware, version 11.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMutational spectrum\nPRKAG2 mutations were identified in 9 independent families (34 pa- tients) ( Figure 1 ). The global pickup rate was 7% but ranged from 0% in isolated HCM cases to 20% when a VPE was present (with or without HCM). The recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln (c.905G . A) was identified in 4 out of the 9 families (Families 1 – 4; 13 patients). The remaining families carried five private mutations, with four of them affecting one of the Cytathionin beta-synthase (CBS) domains (p.Ser333Pro, p.Glu506Lys, p.His530Arg, p.Ser548Pro) ( Figure 2 ). Among the six pathogenic mutations, three had never been reported: p.Ser333Pro (c.997T . C), p.Val336Ala (c.1007T . C), and p.Hi- s530Arg (c.1589A . G). All new mutations fulfilled the criteria in favour of a high probability of being pathogenic according to the clas- sical criteria for classification of genetic variants, i.e. cosegregation in all affected family members, mutant allele frequency , 0.1% in data- bases, highly conserved residues among species and in silico prediction scores in favour of pathogenicity.\n\n\nCardiac phenotype\nPedigrees and genetic status are represented in Figure 1 , and major clinical findings are summarized in Table 1 . Medical history of Families 1, 3, and 4 are summarized below as Family 2 was already published. 20 Families 5 – 9 carrying private mutations were further described except Family 7 already published. 19 Representative ECGs from patients issued from Families 4 and 8 are shown in Figure 3 .\n\n\nFamily 1: p.Arg302Gln\nPatient I-1 presented an asymmetric HCM (IVS: 18 mm) with conduction defect. He underwent a resuscitated sudden cardiac death at 40 years of age, leading to a defibrillator implantation, followed by a cardiac transplantation. His son, patient II-1, presented an antero-septal (18 mm) and posterior (16 mm) left ventricular wall hypertrophy. Holter ECG showed bradycardia with a frequency of 40 – 56 bpm. As he was 18 years old, this patient had twice a radiofrequency ablation of the VPE for a WPW syndrome.\n\n\nFamily 3: p.Arg302Gln\nThe patient was an asymptomatic man, diagnosed for a HCM with a short PR interval at the age of 17 years of age. As the PRKAG2 mu- tation arrived de novo , no relatives presented any cardiac symptoms.\n\n\nFamily 4: p.Arg302Gln\nThe index patient (II-1) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years on the basis of her ECG revealing a HCM associated with a WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 A ). After the first ablation procedure, the PR interval has prolonged, while conduction beats are still pre- excited ( Figure 3 B ). This clearly indicates that the AV node-like properties of the accessory pathway was slightly impaired. At 47 years old, she was implanted with a defibrillator after an aborted sudden cardiac death. Her mother deceased suddenly at the age of 60 years, and her brother (II-2) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years after an inaugural cardiac sudden death. Her daughter (III-1) also presented HCM with an accessory pathway.\n\n\nFamily 5: p.Glu506Lys\nAll the four affected patients harbouring this mutation presented with HCM and a VPE syndrome. All but one (II-3) patient had a WPW syndrome with a short PR interval. Two cases developed an apical hypokinesia (I-1 and II-1), once complicated by an intra- ventricular thrombus. One case presented with a supra-ventricular tachycardia episode complicated by an acute pulmonary oedema at 23 years of age. Finally, they developed a progressive hypokinetic HCM, which ended up with cardiac failure. Two patients under- went a radiofrequency ablation procedure. Both were finally im- planted with a device after the procedure [one (II-1) had a pacemaker because of severe AV conduction block; the other one (I-1) had a defibrillator implanted because of ventricular arrhythmia].\n\n\nFamily 6: p.Val336Ala\nThis three-generation family developed a severe cardiac disease. The index case (Patient I-1) was diagnosed at 35 years of age with a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 2/1 AVB when in sinus rhythm, and a severe HCM. A pacemaker was implanted at 55 years of age because of a symptomatic complete AVB. The progressive evolu- tion of the HCM required a septal alcohol ablation and led to a heart transplant at 60 years of age because of a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient died 1 year later. His two children ( patients II-1 and II-2) were diagnosed with a mild HCM at 12 and 15 years of age. At age 30, they both developed a severe HCM (IVS ¼ 30 mm) with VPE and left bundle branch block pat- terns on the ECG. They both died because of the severe evolution of their HCM to end-stage cardiac failure at 35 years of age. The third generation (Patient III-1) was marked by the diagnosis at 2 months of age of a wide QRS complex tachycardia. This young pa- tient had a HCM and an isolated short PR interval on the ECG. A device was implanted, but he died at 4 years of age because of un- controllable wide QRS tachycardia.\n\n\nFamily 8: p.Ser333Pro\nThe index case (Patient III-1) was diagnosed after an episode of syncope at 22 years of age. The ECG showed a HCM and WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 C ). Echocardiography diagnosed a mi- tral valve prolapse and an asymmetric HCM, dominant at the la- teroposterior wall of the left ventricle. After radiofrequency ablation of the VPE, the ECG showed an isolated short PR inter- val, with no delta wave or QRS enlargement. The sister of the\nindex case (Patient III-2) was diagnosed with a HCM and an iso- lated short PR interval ( Figure 3 D ). A radiofrequency ablation at- tempt of the VPE was unsuccessful and complicated by a\nhigh-degree AVB requiring a pacemaker implantation. A third case (III-2, Figure 3 E ) was diagnosed with HCM and a left bundle branch block, but without VPE.\nFigure 1 Pedigree of the nine families diagnosed with a PRKAG2 mutation.

Families 1 – 4: carriers of the recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln. Families 5 – 9: carriers of private mutations.\n\n\nFamily 9: p.His530Arg\nPatients I-1 and II-2 deceased of sudden death, when they were 29 and 30 years old, respectively. The index case (daughter of II-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation, and heart analysis showed a hypertrophied septum (25 mm). Her daughter (III-1) was diagnosed at 17 years old and is actually waiting for heart transplantation.\n\n\nCardiac and muscle histology\nThe index case of Families 1 and 4 had an endomyocardial biopsy. Histological analysis revealed normal muscle architecture. Periodic acid – Schiff staining disclosed vacuoles with increased glycogen con- tent in patient of Family 1 but was normal in patient of Family 4. One patient (Family 9; Patient III-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation with histological analysis. The heart weight was 373 g ( N : , 350 g). Left ventricle appeared thickened (25 mm), and microscopic exam- ination revealed myofibrillar disorganization with interstitial fibrosis. No PAS staining was performed. The index case of Family 8 had a muscle biopsy because of muscle exercise intolerance complains and ultra-structural analysis exhibited the presence of non- lysosomal glycogen accumulation.\n\n\nTime-to-event study\nThe probability of developing the hallmark clinical features was cal- culated at the age of 40 years ( Figure 4 ) and included the following: (i) VPE 70% (99% CI: 50 – 87%) ( Figure 4 a and b/A ) with a median age at diagnostic of 25 years [IQR (20 – 41)] and (ii) HCM 61% (99% CI: 41 – 81%) ( Figure 4 a and b/B ) with a median age of 32 years [IQR (18-NA)]. Complications occurred in 53% of patients, and the prob- ability of presenting one of the following events: conduction block leading to pacemaker implantation, SCD, defibrillator implantation, or heart transplantation at the age of 40 years, was 31% (99% CI: 16 – 53%) ( Figure 4 a and b/C ) with a median age of 51 years [IQR (38 – 60)]. Taken independently, at 40 years of age, the risk for a con- duction block occurrence was 22% (99% CI: 9 – 46%), the risk of SCD was 20% (99% CI: 8 – 42%), and the probability for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation was of 25% (99% CI: 2 – 48%). None of the paced patients presented an identified interventricular dys- synchrony during transthoracic ECG, and therefore none of them underwent an upgrading of their device to a biventricular model.\nHeart transplant was realized in 2 patients at 55 and 60 years of age. The risk of a fatal issue associated with mutations in PRKAG2 was 11% (99% CI: 4 – 30) at 40 years of age ( Figure 4 a and b/D ), the rest of patients who suffer of SCD being resuscitated. In this co- hort, the median age at death was 60 years [IQR (60 – 65)].\n\n\nGenotype – phenotype correlation\nThe occurrence of a VPE was not different between patients carry- ing the p.Arg302Gln mutation when compared with others ( P ¼ 0.53) ( Figure 4 bA ). The probability of developing a HCM was lower at a similar age in patients carrying the p.Arg302Gln mutation than the others, however, not significant ( P ¼ 0.064) ( Figure 4 bB ). There were no differences regarding overall complications ( Figure 4 bC ) as well as global survival rate ( Figure 4 bD ).\n\n\nDiscussion\nHeterozygous PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an autosomal dominant muscular glycogenosis with mainly cardiac manifestations, including VPE, conduction defects, and eventually HCM. In this study, we reported four families carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation and five families carrying private mutations, adding three novel pathogenic mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) to the literature. The PRKAG2 – p.Arg302Gln recur- rent mutation was reported in several publications. 13 , 20 It was asso- ciated with an important phenotypic variability between families and even within a same family. In our cohort, all index cases presented a short PR, but the cardiac phenotype could be either asymmetric left ventricle hypertrophy, apical hypertrophy, or biatrial hypertrophy. In patients with sarcomeric HCM, the prevalence of a short PR was not precisely known, but it seems to be not an uncommon find- ing. Nevertheless, as VPE is a common feature of storage diseases (Pompe and Danon diseases, PRKAG2 syndrome) and mitochon- drial disorders (MELAS, MERFF) and a short PR interval without pre-excitation is a common feature in the Anderson-Fabry disease, a precise evaluation of the phenotype of patients is essential.\nThrough a retrospective way, our study of 34 mutation carriers gave us the opportunity to realize a complete analysis of clinical and survival characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, and (iii) the genotype – phenotype correl- ation between patients carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln muta- tion compared with patients with other mutations.\nMolecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation seems to be recom- mended when patients are diagnosed with an HCM and a VPE, or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). 13 PRKAG2 mutation screening may be discussed as a differential diagnostic of the Fabry disease when the symptom- atology is limited to cardiac signs (the so-called Fabry cardiac vari- ant). 4 Neuromuscular and visceral manifestations are usually diagnosed in patients with the Pompe disease, Danon disease, or other rare glycogenosis. 3 , 5 , 6 They are rarely evoked as differential diagnosis in unexplained adult HCM. In some patients, MRI examin- ation may be useful in addition to ECG and echocardiography in or- der to clarify the presence of fibrosis and inflammation.\nHerein, three new mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) were added to the nine previously reported in PRKAG2 . According to the literature, most of these mutations are located in the CBS domains ( Figure 2 ) and were non-synonymous substitutions of conserved residues ( Table 2 ). The p.Glu506Lys was first described in eight patients from a Turkish family. They all presented a WPW syndrome associated with a progressive HCM leading to cardiac failure. 17 Similarly, the three patients from Family 5 harbouring this mutation, and who presented with VPE (one WPW and two isolated short PR intervals), developed a progressive HCM which ended up with cardiac failure (left ventricular ejection fraction between 35 and 40% at 40 years of age). Similarly, the p.Hi- s530Arg found in Family 9 is associated with a severe evolution to cardiac failure since the mother had heart transplantation and her\ndaughter is currently listed for heart graft. In this cohort, 6 patients (out of 24 available data) developed hypokinetic HCM with left ven- tricle ejection fraction below 40%. These six patients were concen- trated in 3 families [Family 5 (2/4), Family 6 (3/4), and Family 1(1/2)]. The associated mutations were Glu506Lys, Val336Ala, and Arg302Gln, respectively. These results evidenced a high rate of patients with HCM evolving towards severe dilated hypokinetic HCM in PRKAG2 mutation carriers (25% in our cohort) in contrast to HCM patients carrying a mutation in one of the sarcomeric genes ( 10%). In a pre- vious study, the p.Arg531Gln mutation was associated with a wide range of severity from asymptomatic adult patients to a severe ante- natal presentation with hypokinetic HCM. 15 In our limited cohort, no significant intrafamilial heterogeneity was identified except for p.Arg302Gln mutation carriers who presented with only a short\nA B C D E Figure 3 Twelve-lead ECG tracings from PRKAG2 -mutated patients.

A trend to a lower risk of developing HCM in patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln was also observed.\nIn the literature, the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 syndrome is defined upon four main studies ( Table 2 ). These studies cumulated more than 150 patients originated from 23 families. On average, 25.8% of the patients were asymptomatic, 75% developed a VPE,\nand 66.8% a HCM. Atrioventricular conduction block requiring the implantation of a device were reported in 37.4% of cases. Finally, 5.4% of cases presented with myopathic symptoms. A study on three families was performed and evaluated a global survival of 91% after 12.2 years of follow-up, although the mean age of the pa- tients was not mentioned. 13 As compared with other studies, the\nseverity of the disease in our cohort seemed higher. Overall, 12% of patients were asymptomatic, and global survival at 60 years of age was 67%. These differences may be explained by a higher mean age in our cohort. However, a familial effect may not be excluded in the study of Murphy et al. since 40 out of the 45 patients were from the same family, carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation. 9\nOne of the hallmark symptoms in the PRKAG2 syndrome is the presence of a VPE (WPW or isolated short PR interval). Atypical VPE with decremental AV conduction suggesting fasciculoventricu- lar pathways seems to be frequent in this disorder. 7 , 11 , 12 In the litera- ture, 12% of the cardiac deaths were associated with a short PR interval complication. In this cohort, a VPE was identified in 88% of cases. Most of the ECG tracings and EP testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist (19/23). A ‘genuine’ WPW syn- drome has been identified in 3/19 cases. Among the 16/19 remaining cases, an isolated short PR interval was diagnosed. When EP studies were performed, nodoventricular/fasciculoventricular (Mahaim fi- bres) or AV (para-Hisian pathways) were observed, as previously suggested. 9 , 13 Major EP differences between AV accessory pathways and nodofascicular pathways were identified. During programmed right atrial stimulation, nodofascicular pathways had a decremental AV conduction (progressive lengthening of the AH interval), with a contemporary fixed HV interval and a steady shape of the pre- existed ventricular beats. This indicated that AV conduction over the bypass had node-like properties accessory pathways. After the first ablation attempt in Patient II-1 from Family 4 ( Figure 3 B ), the PR interval was prolonged with persisting pre-existed beats meaning that the conduction through the nodofascicular pathway was slightly impaired. The implication of PRKAG2 during cardiac development and annulus fibrosus integrity may argue in favour of fasciculoventri- cular pathways in the PRKAG2 syndrome. PRKAG2 mutations were showed to be associated with the development of periganglionar secondary pathway typed as Mahaim fibres. 11 , 13 , 14 Six patients of this cohort underwent radiofrequency ablation procedures. Whereas none of them had spontaneous or induced junctional tachycardia, accessory pathways ablations were indicated because short refractory periods were identified during EP testing. Most of the accessory pathways had node-like properties and were located near the His bundle. This may explain why all of the ablated patients developed high-degree AVBs following the procedure requiring a device implantation. The absence of junctional tachycardia and the high rate of AVB complications (para-Hisian location) may also ar- gue in favour of the presence of nodoventricular/fasciculoventricu- lar type of accessory pathways.\nThese data reinforce the importance of a systematic evaluation of muscular symptoms for a better delineation of the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, molecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation should be discussed when patients are diagnosed with HCM and VPE or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). This study pointed out the severity of PRKAG2 syndrome with both myocardial and rhythm complications. The sur- vival rate was 67% at 60 years of age with an elevated penetrance of symptoms. Ablation procedures should be limited to very symp- tomatic VPE patients as pathways are mainly nodoventricular/fasci- culoventricular and therefore at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank patients and their family members for their cooperation.

Ablation is at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks. Therefore, proce- dures in these patients should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 9 In this cohort, four patients developed skeletal muscle symptoms. Three of them were complaining of moderate exercise intolerance. These symptoms did not prompt any paraclinical examination since they were attributed to a low cardiac output. The fourth patient de- veloped a muscle pain during exercise with high creatine kinase levels and was previously reported. 20 This skeletal muscle involve- ment may be associated with particular mutations. Indeed, 7/40 (18%) of patients carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation and 1/4 of pa- tients with p.Ser548Pro mutation developed muscle symptoms. 2 , 20 .... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... .....\n\n\nT able 2 Summary of clinical symptoms reported in the liter a tur e a ccording ea ch muta tion\n\n\nMut a tion NM_ 013203.3 p.Arg302Gln p.H is383Arg (p.His142Arg) p.

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective time-to-event study of the clinical manifestations associated with PRKAG2 mutations.\nMethods and results A cohort of 34 patients from 9 families was recruited between 2001 and 2010. DNA were sequenced on all exons and flanking sequences of the PRKAG2 gene using Sanger sequencing. Overall, four families carried the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and the five others carried private mutations among which three had never been reported. In the total cohort, at 40 years of age, the risk of developing HCM was 61%, VPE 70%, conduction block 22%, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 20%. The global survival at 60 years of age was 66%. Thirty-two per cent of patients ( N ¼ 10) required a device implant- ation (5 pacemakers and 5 defibrillators) at a median age of 66 years, and two patients required heart transplant. Only one patient presented with significant skeletal muscle symptoms. No significant differences regarding the occurrence of VPE, ablation complications, or death incidence were observed between different mutations.\nConclusion This study of patients with PRKAG2 mutations provides a more comprehensive view of the natural history of this disease and demonstrates a high risk of cardiac complications. Early recognition of this disease appears important to allow an appropriate management.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keywords Cardiomyopathy † Time-to-event study † PRKAG2 † Wolff – Parkinson – White † Ventricular pre-excitation\n* Corresponding author.

A genetic ori- gin can be identified in 40 – 60% of HCM, usually with an auto- somal dominant mode of inheritance and most of the culprit genes are coding for sarcomeric proteins implicated in myofibrillar performance. 1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular pre-excitation (VPE) or the Wolff – Parkinson – White (WPW) syndrome suggests particular aetiologies such as a metabol- ic disorder. 2 In a case series of 150 histological examinations of HCM with VPE, 12% of cases were known storage disorders, 3 in- cluding lysosomal diseases (Pompe, Fabry, and Danon diseases) or classical glycogenosis (type III and IV glycogenosis). 3 – 6 Apart from those disorders, often associated with systemic symptoms, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 is a remarkable entity. 7 – 9\nThe PRKAG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK. 7\nThis protein is an ubiquitous sensor of the cellular energetic balance. More specifically, PRKAG2 is expressed in muscle cells, and PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an excess of glycogen in those tis- sues. 10 Interestingly, the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK may partici- pate to cardiac development and specifically to the atrioventricular (AV) annulus fibrosus development. 11 – 14 Contrasting with the sar- comeric HCM aetiologies, mutations of PRKAG2 are known to cause an energetic disease affecting cardiac muscle. 9 Following the identi- fication of mutations in PRKAG2 in 2001, 150 patients have been reported so far. Half of the cases were carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and a dozen of other non-recurrent muta- tions were listed. 15 – 18 Besides the clinical hallmarks of patients car- rying mutations in PRKAG2 , namely HCM and VPE, rarely patients were reported with myopathic symptoms, suggesting the existence of scarce extra-cardiac symptoms. 9 , 19 To date, there are no pub- lished data assessing the ‘time-to-event’ clinical manifestations, com- plications, and survival in the patients with mutations in PRKAG2 gene. Hence, the management of patients is strongly limited by poor information on natural history. The aim of these retrospective time-to-event study was to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, (iii) the genotype – phenotype correlation between patients carrying\nthe recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation compared with patients with other mutations.\n\n\nMethods\nStudy population and diagnostic criteria\nIn this retrospective study, we gathered the clinical data from the pa- tients diagnosed with disease-causing mutations of PRKAG2 diagnosed in the French molecular laboratory for inherited cardiac disorders at Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re hospital between 2001 and 2010.\nIndications for the genetic test were (i) a family history of SCD (two or more cases), (ii) an echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM [interventri- cular septum (IVS) of 15 mm or more], (iii) HCM with VPE, and (iv) a family history of VPE (two or more cases). Most of the electrocardio- gram (ECG) tracings and electrophysiological (EP) testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist.\nA short PR interval was diagnosed on an ECG when , 120 ms. We considered that patients had a genuine WPW syndrome when a short PR interval was associated with a delta wave and an enlarged QRS com- plex. Patients with isolated short PR interval were classified as VPE non-WPW syndrome.\n\n\nGenetic testing\nOverall, 120 patients with HCM + VPE ( N ¼ 60), HCM + WPW ( N ¼ 30), and isolated WPW ( N ¼ 30) were screened for PRKAG2 mutations by means of Sanger sequencing (RefSeq PRKAG2 : NM_016203.3). Chro- matographs were analysed with the SeqScape software (Applied Biosys- tems w ). For new variants, the pathogenicity was concluded when the variant (i) co-segregated with the phenotype in the family; (ii) was absent from public database of healthy human variants ( http://exac.broadinstitute. org/ ; http://evs.gs.washington.edu ); and (iii) predicted to be damaging by at least three of the following bioinformatics prediction software: Polyphen2, Mutation taster, SIFT, and GVGD and changed the physico-chemical property of the reference amino acid (Grantham score).\n\n\nQuestionnaires\nA questionnaire was designed and sent to the referring clinicians of the 34 patients. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (i) diag- nostic circumstances and initial presentation; (ii) cardiac symptoms with details on imaging and rhythmic evaluations; and (iii) extra-cardiac man- ifestations of the disease, especially myopathy symptoms.\n\n\nMyocardial and muscle biopsies\nTwo patients had an endomyocardial biopsy during the etiological workup: one underwent a heart transplant with a macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the explanted heart, and the other had a muscle biopsy for diagnostic purpose. Standard haematoxylin-eosin (HES) and periodic acid – Schiff (PAS) staining were performed.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all time-to-event analyses, the baseline date (time zero) was the date of birth. In order to describe the evolution of clinical features over time, time to event was defined as the interval between birth and the event of interest (occurrence of symptoms or death). Subjects who did not ex- perience the event during their follow-up were censored at their last follow-up. To test the heterogeneity across families, a frailty Cox’s pro- portional hazards (PH) model estimated the effect of the mutation type on the risk of clinical lesion occurrence. Studied clinical lesions included VPE and HCM. Complications included conduction troubles [atrioven- tricular block (AVB) and sinus dysfunction] leading to pacemaker\n\n\nWhat’s new?\n† The global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening was estimated according to clinical presentation and identification of three new mutations associated with this disease.\n† The natural course of PRKAG2 syndrome was highlighted with hypertrophic and conductive complications according to a time-to-event study.\n† The extended clinical spectrum to skeletal muscle was de- scribed in some patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 , sug- gesting that myopathic symptoms could be systematically assessed in patients.\nimplantation, sudden cardiac death, and heart transplantation. Due to the small number of patients with a specific mutation, only patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation (4 families and 13 affected pa- tients) could be compared with patients carrying other mutations (5 families and 21 affected patients).\nIf heterogeneity across families was found with the frailty Cox’s PH model, the Kaplan – Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of clinical manifestations occurrence at each age. Log-rank tests were performed to compare mutation groups. For all analyses, P , 0.01 was considered significant, due to the number of tests. Stata soft- ware, version 11.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMutational spectrum\nPRKAG2 mutations were identified in 9 independent families (34 pa- tients) ( Figure 1 ). The global pickup rate was 7% but ranged from 0% in isolated HCM cases to 20% when a VPE was present (with or without HCM). The recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln (c.905G . A) was identified in 4 out of the 9 families (Families 1 – 4; 13 patients). The remaining families carried five private mutations, with four of them affecting one of the Cytathionin beta-synthase (CBS) domains (p.Ser333Pro, p.Glu506Lys, p.His530Arg, p.Ser548Pro) ( Figure 2 ). Among the six pathogenic mutations, three had never been reported: p.Ser333Pro (c.997T . C), p.Val336Ala (c.1007T . C), and p.Hi- s530Arg (c.1589A . G). All new mutations fulfilled the criteria in favour of a high probability of being pathogenic according to the clas- sical criteria for classification of genetic variants, i.e. cosegregation in all affected family members, mutant allele frequency , 0.1% in data- bases, highly conserved residues among species and in silico prediction scores in favour of pathogenicity.\n\n\nCardiac phenotype\nPedigrees and genetic status are represented in Figure 1 , and major clinical findings are summarized in Table 1 . Medical history of Families 1, 3, and 4 are summarized below as Family 2 was already published. 20 Families 5 – 9 carrying private mutations were further described except Family 7 already published. 19 Representative ECGs from patients issued from Families 4 and 8 are shown in Figure 3 .\n\n\nFamily 1: p.Arg302Gln\nPatient I-1 presented an asymmetric HCM (IVS: 18 mm) with conduction defect. He underwent a resuscitated sudden cardiac death at 40 years of age, leading to a defibrillator implantation, followed by a cardiac transplantation. His son, patient II-1, presented an antero-septal (18 mm) and posterior (16 mm) left ventricular wall hypertrophy. Holter ECG showed bradycardia with a frequency of 40 – 56 bpm. As he was 18 years old, this patient had twice a radiofrequency ablation of the VPE for a WPW syndrome.\n\n\nFamily 3: p.Arg302Gln\nThe patient was an asymptomatic man, diagnosed for a HCM with a short PR interval at the age of 17 years of age. As the PRKAG2 mu- tation arrived de novo , no relatives presented any cardiac symptoms.\n\n\nFamily 4: p.Arg302Gln\nThe index patient (II-1) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years on the basis of her ECG revealing a HCM associated with a WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 A ). After the first ablation procedure, the PR interval has prolonged, while conduction beats are still pre- excited ( Figure 3 B ). This clearly indicates that the AV node-like properties of the accessory pathway was slightly impaired. At 47 years old, she was implanted with a defibrillator after an aborted sudden cardiac death. Her mother deceased suddenly at the age of 60 years, and her brother (II-2) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years after an inaugural cardiac sudden death. Her daughter (III-1) also presented HCM with an accessory pathway.\n\n\nFamily 5: p.Glu506Lys\nAll the four affected patients harbouring this mutation presented with HCM and a VPE syndrome. All but one (II-3) patient had a WPW syndrome with a short PR interval. Two cases developed an apical hypokinesia (I-1 and II-1), once complicated by an intra- ventricular thrombus. One case presented with a supra-ventricular tachycardia episode complicated by an acute pulmonary oedema at 23 years of age. Finally, they developed a progressive hypokinetic HCM, which ended up with cardiac failure. Two patients under- went a radiofrequency ablation procedure. Both were finally im- planted with a device after the procedure [one (II-1) had a pacemaker because of severe AV conduction block; the other one (I-1) had a defibrillator implanted because of ventricular arrhythmia].\n\n\nFamily 6: p.Val336Ala\nThis three-generation family developed a severe cardiac disease. The index case (Patient I-1) was diagnosed at 35 years of age with a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 2/1 AVB when in sinus rhythm, and a severe HCM. A pacemaker was implanted at 55 years of age because of a symptomatic complete AVB. The progressive evolu- tion of the HCM required a septal alcohol ablation and led to a heart transplant at 60 years of age because of a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient died 1 year later. His two children ( patients II-1 and II-2) were diagnosed with a mild HCM at 12 and 15 years of age. At age 30, they both developed a severe HCM (IVS ¼ 30 mm) with VPE and left bundle branch block pat- terns on the ECG. They both died because of the severe evolution of their HCM to end-stage cardiac failure at 35 years of age. The third generation (Patient III-1) was marked by the diagnosis at 2 months of age of a wide QRS complex tachycardia. This young pa- tient had a HCM and an isolated short PR interval on the ECG. A device was implanted, but he died at 4 years of age because of un- controllable wide QRS tachycardia.\n\n\nFamily 8: p.Ser333Pro\nThe index case (Patient III-1) was diagnosed after an episode of syncope at 22 years of age. The ECG showed a HCM and WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 C ). Echocardiography diagnosed a mi- tral valve prolapse and an asymmetric HCM, dominant at the la- teroposterior wall of the left ventricle. After radiofrequency ablation of the VPE, the ECG showed an isolated short PR inter- val, with no delta wave or QRS enlargement. The sister of the\nindex case (Patient III-2) was diagnosed with a HCM and an iso- lated short PR interval ( Figure 3 D ). A radiofrequency ablation at- tempt of the VPE was unsuccessful and complicated by a\nhigh-degree AVB requiring a pacemaker implantation. A third case (III-2, Figure 3 E ) was diagnosed with HCM and a left bundle branch block, but without VPE.\nFigure 1 Pedigree of the nine families diagnosed with a PRKAG2 mutation. Squares, males; circles, females; filled symbols, clinically affected sub- jects; slash, deceased patient; + / 2 , mutation present at heterozygous status Index case indicated by arrow. Families 1 – 4: carriers of the recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln. Families 5 – 9: carriers of private mutations.\n\n\nFamily 9: p.His530Arg\nPatients I-1 and II-2 deceased of sudden death, when they were 29 and 30 years old, respectively. The index case (daughter of II-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation, and heart analysis showed a hypertrophied septum (25 mm). Her daughter (III-1) was diagnosed at 17 years old and is actually waiting for heart transplantation.\n\n\nCardiac and muscle histology\nThe index case of Families 1 and 4 had an endomyocardial biopsy. Histological analysis revealed normal muscle architecture. Periodic acid – Schiff staining disclosed vacuoles with increased glycogen con- tent in patient of Family 1 but was normal in patient of Family 4. One patient (Family 9; Patient III-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation with histological analysis. The heart weight was 373 g ( N : , 350 g). Left ventricle appeared thickened (25 mm), and microscopic exam- ination revealed myofibrillar disorganization with interstitial fibrosis. No PAS staining was performed. The index case of Family 8 had a muscle biopsy because of muscle exercise intolerance complains and ultra-structural analysis exhibited the presence of non- lysosomal glycogen accumulation.\n\n\nTime-to-event study\nThe probability of developing the hallmark clinical features was cal- culated at the age of 40 years ( Figure 4 ) and included the following: (i) VPE 70% (99% CI: 50 – 87%) ( Figure 4 a and b/A ) with a median age at diagnostic of 25 years [IQR (20 – 41)] and (ii) HCM 61% (99% CI: 41 – 81%) ( Figure 4 a and b/B ) with a median age of 32 years [IQR (18-NA)]. Complications occurred in 53% of patients, and the prob- ability of presenting one of the following events: conduction block leading to pacemaker implantation, SCD, defibrillator implantation, or heart transplantation at the age of 40 years, was 31% (99% CI: 16 – 53%) ( Figure 4 a and b/C ) with a median age of 51 years [IQR (38 – 60)]. Taken independently, at 40 years of age, the risk for a con- duction block occurrence was 22% (99% CI: 9 – 46%), the risk of SCD was 20% (99% CI: 8 – 42%), and the probability for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation was of 25% (99% CI: 2 – 48%). None of the paced patients presented an identified interventricular dys- synchrony during transthoracic ECG, and therefore none of them underwent an upgrading of their device to a biventricular model.\nHeart transplant was realized in 2 patients at 55 and 60 years of age. The risk of a fatal issue associated with mutations in PRKAG2 was 11% (99% CI: 4 – 30) at 40 years of age ( Figure 4 a and b/D ), the rest of patients who suffer of SCD being resuscitated. In this co- hort, the median age at death was 60 years [IQR (60 – 65)].\n\n\nGenotype – phenotype correlation\nThe occurrence of a VPE was not different between patients carry- ing the p.Arg302Gln mutation when compared with others ( P ¼ 0.53) ( Figure 4 bA ). The probability of developing a HCM was lower at a similar age in patients carrying the p.Arg302Gln mutation than the others, however, not significant ( P ¼ 0.064) ( Figure 4 bB ). There were no differences regarding overall complications ( Figure 4 bC ) as well as global survival rate ( Figure 4 bD ).\n\n\nDiscussion\nHeterozygous PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an autosomal dominant muscular glycogenosis with mainly cardiac manifestations, including VPE, conduction defects, and eventually HCM. In this study, we reported four families carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation and five families carrying private mutations, adding three novel pathogenic mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) to the literature. The PRKAG2 – p.Arg302Gln recur- rent mutation was reported in several publications. 13 , 20 It was asso- ciated with an important phenotypic variability between families and even within a same family. In our cohort, all index cases presented a short PR, but the cardiac phenotype could be either asymmetric left ventricle hypertrophy, apical hypertrophy, or biatrial hypertrophy. In patients with sarcomeric HCM, the prevalence of a short PR was not precisely known, but it seems to be not an uncommon find- ing. Nevertheless, as VPE is a common feature of storage diseases (Pompe and Danon diseases, PRKAG2 syndrome) and mitochon- drial disorders (MELAS, MERFF) and a short PR interval without pre-excitation is a common feature in the Anderson-Fabry disease, a precise evaluation of the phenotype of patients is essential.\nThrough a retrospective way, our study of 34 mutation carriers gave us the opportunity to realize a complete analysis of clinical and survival characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, and (iii) the genotype – phenotype correl- ation between patients carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln muta- tion compared with patients with other mutations.\nMolecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation seems to be recom- mended when patients are diagnosed with an HCM and a VPE, or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). 13 PRKAG2 mutation screening may be discussed as a differential diagnostic of the Fabry disease when the symptom- atology is limited to cardiac signs (the so-called Fabry cardiac vari- ant). 4 Neuromuscular and visceral manifestations are usually diagnosed in patients with the Pompe disease, Danon disease, or other rare glycogenosis. 3 , 5 , 6 They are rarely evoked as differential diagnosis in unexplained adult HCM. In some patients, MRI examin- ation may be useful in addition to ECG and echocardiography in or- der to clarify the presence of fibrosis and inflammation.\nHerein, three new mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) were added to the nine previously reported in PRKAG2 . According to the literature, most of these mutations are located in the CBS domains ( Figure 2 ) and were non-synonymous substitutions of conserved residues ( Table 2 ). The p.Glu506Lys was first described in eight patients from a Turkish family. They all presented a WPW syndrome associated with a progressive HCM leading to cardiac failure. 17 Similarly, the three patients from Family 5 harbouring this mutation, and who presented with VPE (one WPW and two isolated short PR intervals), developed a progressive HCM which ended up with cardiac failure (left ventricular ejection fraction between 35 and 40% at 40 years of age). Similarly, the p.Hi- s530Arg found in Family 9 is associated with a severe evolution to cardiac failure since the mother had heart transplantation and her\ndaughter is currently listed for heart graft. In this cohort, 6 patients (out of 24 available data) developed hypokinetic HCM with left ven- tricle ejection fraction below 40%. These six patients were concen- trated in 3 families [Family 5 (2/4), Family 6 (3/4), and Family 1(1/2)]. The associated mutations were Glu506Lys, Val336Ala, and Arg302Gln, respectively. These results evidenced a high rate of patients with HCM evolving towards severe dilated hypokinetic HCM in PRKAG2 mutation carriers (25% in our cohort) in contrast to HCM patients carrying a mutation in one of the sarcomeric genes ( 10%). In a pre- vious study, the p.Arg531Gln mutation was associated with a wide range of severity from asymptomatic adult patients to a severe ante- natal presentation with hypokinetic HCM. 15 In our limited cohort, no significant intrafamilial heterogeneity was identified except for p.Arg302Gln mutation carriers who presented with only a short\nA B C D E Figure 3 Twelve-lead ECG tracings from PRKAG2 -mutated patients.

A trend to a lower risk of developing HCM in patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln was also observed.\nIn the literature, the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 syndrome is defined upon four main studies ( Table 2 ). These studies cumulated more than 150 patients originated from 23 families. On average, 25.8% of the patients were asymptomatic, 75% developed a VPE,\nand 66.8% a HCM. Atrioventricular conduction block requiring the implantation of a device were reported in 37.4% of cases. Finally, 5.4% of cases presented with myopathic symptoms. A study on three families was performed and evaluated a global survival of 91% after 12.2 years of follow-up, although the mean age of the pa- tients was not mentioned. 13 As compared with other studies, the\nseverity of the disease in our cohort seemed higher. Overall, 12% of patients were asymptomatic, and global survival at 60 years of age was 67%. These differences may be explained by a higher mean age in our cohort. However, a familial effect may not be excluded in the study of Murphy et al. since 40 out of the 45 patients were from the same family, carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation. 9\nOne of the hallmark symptoms in the PRKAG2 syndrome is the presence of a VPE (WPW or isolated short PR interval). Atypical VPE with decremental AV conduction suggesting fasciculoventricu- lar pathways seems to be frequent in this disorder. 7 , 11 , 12 In the litera- ture, 12% of the cardiac deaths were associated with a short PR interval complication. In this cohort, a VPE was identified in 88% of cases. Most of the ECG tracings and EP testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist (19/23). A ‘genuine’ WPW syn- drome has been identified in 3/19 cases. Among the 16/19 remaining cases, an isolated short PR interval was diagnosed. When EP studies were performed, nodoventricular/fasciculoventricular (Mahaim fi- bres) or AV (para-Hisian pathways) were observed, as previously suggested. 9 , 13 Major EP differences between AV accessory pathways and nodofascicular pathways were identified. During programmed right atrial stimulation, nodofascicular pathways had a decremental AV conduction (progressive lengthening of the AH interval), with a contemporary fixed HV interval and a steady shape of the pre- existed ventricular beats. This indicated that AV conduction over the bypass had node-like properties accessory pathways. After the first ablation attempt in Patient II-1 from Family 4 ( Figure 3 B ), the PR interval was prolonged with persisting pre-existed beats meaning that the conduction through the nodofascicular pathway was slightly impaired. The implication of PRKAG2 during cardiac development and annulus fibrosus integrity may argue in favour of fasciculoventri- cular pathways in the PRKAG2 syndrome. PRKAG2 mutations were showed to be associated with the development of periganglionar secondary pathway typed as Mahaim fibres. 11 , 13 , 14 Six patients of this cohort underwent radiofrequency ablation procedures. Whereas none of them had spontaneous or induced junctional tachycardia, accessory pathways ablations were indicated because short refractory periods were identified during EP testing. Most of the accessory pathways had node-like properties and were located near the His bundle. This may explain why all of the ablated patients developed high-degree AVBs following the procedure requiring a device implantation. The absence of junctional tachycardia and the high rate of AVB complications (para-Hisian location) may also ar- gue in favour of the presence of nodoventricular/fasciculoventricu- lar type of accessory pathways.\nThese data reinforce the importance of a systematic evaluation of muscular symptoms for a better delineation of the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, molecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation should be discussed when patients are diagnosed with HCM and VPE or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). This study pointed out the severity of PRKAG2 syndrome with both myocardial and rhythm complications. The sur- vival rate was 67% at 60 years of age with an elevated penetrance of symptoms. Ablation procedures should be limited to very symp- tomatic VPE patients as pathways are mainly nodoventricular/fasci- culoventricular and therefore at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank patients and their family members for their cooperation.

Ablation is at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks. Therefore, proce- dures in these patients should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 9 In this cohort, four patients developed skeletal muscle symptoms. Three of them were complaining of moderate exercise intolerance. These symptoms did not prompt any paraclinical examination since they were attributed to a low cardiac output. The fourth patient de- veloped a muscle pain during exercise with high creatine kinase levels and was previously reported. 20 This skeletal muscle involve- ment may be associated with particular mutations. Indeed, 7/40 (18%) of patients carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation and 1/4 of pa- tients with p.Ser548Pro mutation developed muscle symptoms. 2 , 20 .... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... .....\n\n\nT able 2 Summary of clinical symptoms reported in the liter a tur e a ccording ea ch muta tion\n\n\nMut a tion NM_ 013203.3 p.Arg302Gln p.H is383Arg (p.His142Arg) p.

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective time-to-event study of the clinical manifestations associated with PRKAG2 mutations.\nMethods and results A cohort of 34 patients from 9 families was recruited between 2001 and 2010. DNA were sequenced on all exons and flanking sequences of the PRKAG2 gene using Sanger sequencing. Overall, four families carried the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and the five others carried private mutations among which three had never been reported. In the total cohort, at 40 years of age, the risk of developing HCM was 61%, VPE 70%, conduction block 22%, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 20%. The global survival at 60 years of age was 66%. Thirty-two per cent of patients ( N ¼ 10) required a device implant- ation (5 pacemakers and 5 defibrillators) at a median age of 66 years, and two patients required heart transplant. Only one patient presented with significant skeletal muscle symptoms. No significant differences regarding the occurrence of VPE, ablation complications, or death incidence were observed between different mutations.\nConclusion This study of patients with PRKAG2 mutations provides a more comprehensive view of the natural history of this disease and demonstrates a high risk of cardiac complications. Early recognition of this disease appears important to allow an appropriate management.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keywords Cardiomyopathy † Time-to-event study † PRKAG2 † Wolff – Parkinson – White † Ventricular pre-excitation\n* Corresponding author.

A genetic ori- gin can be identified in 40 – 60% of HCM, usually with an auto- somal dominant mode of inheritance and most of the culprit genes are coding for sarcomeric proteins implicated in myofibrillar performance. 1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular pre-excitation (VPE) or the Wolff – Parkinson – White (WPW) syndrome suggests particular aetiologies such as a metabol- ic disorder. 2 In a case series of 150 histological examinations of HCM with VPE, 12% of cases were known storage disorders, 3 in- cluding lysosomal diseases (Pompe, Fabry, and Danon diseases) or classical glycogenosis (type III and IV glycogenosis). 3 – 6 Apart from those disorders, often associated with systemic symptoms, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 is a remarkable entity. 7 – 9\nThe PRKAG2 gene encodes the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK. 7\nThis protein is an ubiquitous sensor of the cellular energetic balance. More specifically, PRKAG2 is expressed in muscle cells, and PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an excess of glycogen in those tis- sues. 10 Interestingly, the gamma 2 subunit of the AMPK may partici- pate to cardiac development and specifically to the atrioventricular (AV) annulus fibrosus development. 11 – 14 Contrasting with the sar- comeric HCM aetiologies, mutations of PRKAG2 are known to cause an energetic disease affecting cardiac muscle. 9 Following the identi- fication of mutations in PRKAG2 in 2001, 150 patients have been reported so far. Half of the cases were carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation, and a dozen of other non-recurrent muta- tions were listed. 15 – 18 Besides the clinical hallmarks of patients car- rying mutations in PRKAG2 , namely HCM and VPE, rarely patients were reported with myopathic symptoms, suggesting the existence of scarce extra-cardiac symptoms. 9 , 19 To date, there are no pub- lished data assessing the ‘time-to-event’ clinical manifestations, com- plications, and survival in the patients with mutations in PRKAG2 gene. Hence, the management of patients is strongly limited by poor information on natural history. The aim of these retrospective time-to-event study was to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, (iii) the genotype – phenotype correlation between patients carrying\nthe recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation compared with patients with other mutations.\n\n\nMethods\nStudy population and diagnostic criteria\nIn this retrospective study, we gathered the clinical data from the pa- tients diagnosed with disease-causing mutations of PRKAG2 diagnosed in the French molecular laboratory for inherited cardiac disorders at Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re hospital between 2001 and 2010.\nIndications for the genetic test were (i) a family history of SCD (two or more cases), (ii) an echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM [interventri- cular septum (IVS) of 15 mm or more], (iii) HCM with VPE, and (iv) a family history of VPE (two or more cases). Most of the electrocardio- gram (ECG) tracings and electrophysiological (EP) testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist.\nA short PR interval was diagnosed on an ECG when , 120 ms. We considered that patients had a genuine WPW syndrome when a short PR interval was associated with a delta wave and an enlarged QRS com- plex. Patients with isolated short PR interval were classified as VPE non-WPW syndrome.\n\n\nGenetic testing\nOverall, 120 patients with HCM + VPE ( N ¼ 60), HCM + WPW ( N ¼ 30), and isolated WPW ( N ¼ 30) were screened for PRKAG2 mutations by means of Sanger sequencing (RefSeq PRKAG2 : NM_016203.3). Chro- matographs were analysed with the SeqScape software (Applied Biosys- tems w ). For new variants, the pathogenicity was concluded when the variant (i) co-segregated with the phenotype in the family; (ii) was absent from public database of healthy human variants ( http://exac.broadinstitute. org/ ; http://evs.gs.washington.edu ); and (iii) predicted to be damaging by at least three of the following bioinformatics prediction software: Polyphen2, Mutation taster, SIFT, and GVGD and changed the physico-chemical property of the reference amino acid (Grantham score).\n\n\nQuestionnaires\nA questionnaire was designed and sent to the referring clinicians of the 34 patients. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (i) diag- nostic circumstances and initial presentation; (ii) cardiac symptoms with details on imaging and rhythmic evaluations; and (iii) extra-cardiac man- ifestations of the disease, especially myopathy symptoms.\n\n\nMyocardial and muscle biopsies\nTwo patients had an endomyocardial biopsy during the etiological workup: one underwent a heart transplant with a macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the explanted heart, and the other had a muscle biopsy for diagnostic purpose. Standard haematoxylin-eosin (HES) and periodic acid – Schiff (PAS) staining were performed.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all time-to-event analyses, the baseline date (time zero) was the date of birth. In order to describe the evolution of clinical features over time, time to event was defined as the interval between birth and the event of interest (occurrence of symptoms or death). Subjects who did not ex- perience the event during their follow-up were censored at their last follow-up. To test the heterogeneity across families, a frailty Cox’s pro- portional hazards (PH) model estimated the effect of the mutation type on the risk of clinical lesion occurrence. Studied clinical lesions included VPE and HCM. Complications included conduction troubles [atrioven- tricular block (AVB) and sinus dysfunction] leading to pacemaker\n\n\nWhat’s new?\n† The global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening was estimated according to clinical presentation and identification of three new mutations associated with this disease.\n† The natural course of PRKAG2 syndrome was highlighted with hypertrophic and conductive complications according to a time-to-event study.\n† The extended clinical spectrum to skeletal muscle was de- scribed in some patients carrying mutations in PRKAG2 , sug- gesting that myopathic symptoms could be systematically assessed in patients.\nimplantation, sudden cardiac death, and heart transplantation. Due to the small number of patients with a specific mutation, only patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation (4 families and 13 affected pa- tients) could be compared with patients carrying other mutations (5 families and 21 affected patients).\nIf heterogeneity across families was found with the frailty Cox’s PH model, the Kaplan – Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of clinical manifestations occurrence at each age. Log-rank tests were performed to compare mutation groups. For all analyses, P , 0.01 was considered significant, due to the number of tests. Stata soft- ware, version 11.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMutational spectrum\nPRKAG2 mutations were identified in 9 independent families (34 pa- tients) ( Figure 1 ). The global pickup rate was 7% but ranged from 0% in isolated HCM cases to 20% when a VPE was present (with or without HCM). The recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln (c.905G . A) was identified in 4 out of the 9 families (Families 1 – 4; 13 patients). The remaining families carried five private mutations, with four of them affecting one of the Cytathionin beta-synthase (CBS) domains (p.Ser333Pro, p.Glu506Lys, p.His530Arg, p.Ser548Pro) ( Figure 2 ). Among the six pathogenic mutations, three had never been reported: p.Ser333Pro (c.997T . C), p.Val336Ala (c.1007T . C), and p.Hi- s530Arg (c.1589A . G). All new mutations fulfilled the criteria in favour of a high probability of being pathogenic according to the clas- sical criteria for classification of genetic variants, i.e. cosegregation in all affected family members, mutant allele frequency , 0.1% in data- bases, highly conserved residues among species and in silico prediction scores in favour of pathogenicity.\n\n\nCardiac phenotype\nPedigrees and genetic status are represented in Figure 1 , and major clinical findings are summarized in Table 1 . Medical history of Families 1, 3, and 4 are summarized below as Family 2 was already published. 20 Families 5 – 9 carrying private mutations were further described except Family 7 already published. 19 Representative ECGs from patients issued from Families 4 and 8 are shown in Figure 3 .\n\n\nFamily 1: p.Arg302Gln\nPatient I-1 presented an asymmetric HCM (IVS: 18 mm) with conduction defect. He underwent a resuscitated sudden cardiac death at 40 years of age, leading to a defibrillator implantation, followed by a cardiac transplantation. His son, patient II-1, presented an antero-septal (18 mm) and posterior (16 mm) left ventricular wall hypertrophy. Holter ECG showed bradycardia with a frequency of 40 – 56 bpm. As he was 18 years old, this patient had twice a radiofrequency ablation of the VPE for a WPW syndrome.\n\n\nFamily 3: p.Arg302Gln\nThe patient was an asymptomatic man, diagnosed for a HCM with a short PR interval at the age of 17 years of age. As the PRKAG2 mu- tation arrived de novo , no relatives presented any cardiac symptoms.\n\n\nFamily 4: p.Arg302Gln\nThe index patient (II-1) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years on the basis of her ECG revealing a HCM associated with a WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 A ). After the first ablation procedure, the PR interval has prolonged, while conduction beats are still pre- excited ( Figure 3 B ). This clearly indicates that the AV node-like properties of the accessory pathway was slightly impaired. At 47 years old, she was implanted with a defibrillator after an aborted sudden cardiac death. Her mother deceased suddenly at the age of 60 years, and her brother (II-2) was diagnosed at the age of 30 years after an inaugural cardiac sudden death. Her daughter (III-1) also presented HCM with an accessory pathway.\n\n\nFamily 5: p.Glu506Lys\nAll the four affected patients harbouring this mutation presented with HCM and a VPE syndrome. All but one (II-3) patient had a WPW syndrome with a short PR interval. Two cases developed an apical hypokinesia (I-1 and II-1), once complicated by an intra- ventricular thrombus. One case presented with a supra-ventricular tachycardia episode complicated by an acute pulmonary oedema at 23 years of age. Finally, they developed a progressive hypokinetic HCM, which ended up with cardiac failure. Two patients under- went a radiofrequency ablation procedure. Both were finally im- planted with a device after the procedure [one (II-1) had a pacemaker because of severe AV conduction block; the other one (I-1) had a defibrillator implanted because of ventricular arrhythmia].\n\n\nFamily 6: p.Val336Ala\nThis three-generation family developed a severe cardiac disease. The index case (Patient I-1) was diagnosed at 35 years of age with a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 2/1 AVB when in sinus rhythm, and a severe HCM. A pacemaker was implanted at 55 years of age because of a symptomatic complete AVB. The progressive evolu- tion of the HCM required a septal alcohol ablation and led to a heart transplant at 60 years of age because of a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient died 1 year later. His two children ( patients II-1 and II-2) were diagnosed with a mild HCM at 12 and 15 years of age. At age 30, they both developed a severe HCM (IVS ¼ 30 mm) with VPE and left bundle branch block pat- terns on the ECG. They both died because of the severe evolution of their HCM to end-stage cardiac failure at 35 years of age. The third generation (Patient III-1) was marked by the diagnosis at 2 months of age of a wide QRS complex tachycardia. This young pa- tient had a HCM and an isolated short PR interval on the ECG. A device was implanted, but he died at 4 years of age because of un- controllable wide QRS tachycardia.\n\n\nFamily 8: p.Ser333Pro\nThe index case (Patient III-1) was diagnosed after an episode of syncope at 22 years of age. The ECG showed a HCM and WPW syndrome ( Figure 3 C ). Echocardiography diagnosed a mi- tral valve prolapse and an asymmetric HCM, dominant at the la- teroposterior wall of the left ventricle. After radiofrequency ablation of the VPE, the ECG showed an isolated short PR inter- val, with no delta wave or QRS enlargement. The sister of the\nindex case (Patient III-2) was diagnosed with a HCM and an iso- lated short PR interval ( Figure 3 D ). A radiofrequency ablation at- tempt of the VPE was unsuccessful and complicated by a\nhigh-degree AVB requiring a pacemaker implantation. A third case (III-2, Figure 3 E ) was diagnosed with HCM and a left bundle branch block, but without VPE.\nFigure 1 Pedigree of the nine families diagnosed with a PRKAG2 mutation.

Families 1 – 4: carriers of the recurrent mutation p.Arg302Gln. Families 5 – 9: carriers of private mutations.\n\n\nFamily 9: p.His530Arg\nPatients I-1 and II-2 deceased of sudden death, when they were 29 and 30 years old, respectively. The index case (daughter of II-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation, and heart analysis showed a hypertrophied septum (25 mm). Her daughter (III-1) was diagnosed at 17 years old and is actually waiting for heart transplantation.\n\n\nCardiac and muscle histology\nThe index case of Families 1 and 4 had an endomyocardial biopsy. Histological analysis revealed normal muscle architecture. Periodic acid – Schiff staining disclosed vacuoles with increased glycogen con- tent in patient of Family 1 but was normal in patient of Family 4. One patient (Family 9; Patient III-1) underwent a cardiac transplantation with histological analysis. The heart weight was 373 g ( N : , 350 g). Left ventricle appeared thickened (25 mm), and microscopic exam- ination revealed myofibrillar disorganization with interstitial fibrosis. No PAS staining was performed. The index case of Family 8 had a muscle biopsy because of muscle exercise intolerance complains and ultra-structural analysis exhibited the presence of non- lysosomal glycogen accumulation.\n\n\nTime-to-event study\nThe probability of developing the hallmark clinical features was cal- culated at the age of 40 years ( Figure 4 ) and included the following: (i) VPE 70% (99% CI: 50 – 87%) ( Figure 4 a and b/A ) with a median age at diagnostic of 25 years [IQR (20 – 41)] and (ii) HCM 61% (99% CI: 41 – 81%) ( Figure 4 a and b/B ) with a median age of 32 years [IQR (18-NA)]. Complications occurred in 53% of patients, and the prob- ability of presenting one of the following events: conduction block leading to pacemaker implantation, SCD, defibrillator implantation, or heart transplantation at the age of 40 years, was 31% (99% CI: 16 – 53%) ( Figure 4 a and b/C ) with a median age of 51 years [IQR (38 – 60)]. Taken independently, at 40 years of age, the risk for a con- duction block occurrence was 22% (99% CI: 9 – 46%), the risk of SCD was 20% (99% CI: 8 – 42%), and the probability for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation was of 25% (99% CI: 2 – 48%). None of the paced patients presented an identified interventricular dys- synchrony during transthoracic ECG, and therefore none of them underwent an upgrading of their device to a biventricular model.\nHeart transplant was realized in 2 patients at 55 and 60 years of age. The risk of a fatal issue associated with mutations in PRKAG2 was 11% (99% CI: 4 – 30) at 40 years of age ( Figure 4 a and b/D ), the rest of patients who suffer of SCD being resuscitated. In this co- hort, the median age at death was 60 years [IQR (60 – 65)].\n\n\nGenotype – phenotype correlation\nThe occurrence of a VPE was not different between patients carry- ing the p.Arg302Gln mutation when compared with others ( P ¼ 0.53) ( Figure 4 bA ). The probability of developing a HCM was lower at a similar age in patients carrying the p.Arg302Gln mutation than the others, however, not significant ( P ¼ 0.064) ( Figure 4 bB ). There were no differences regarding overall complications ( Figure 4 bC ) as well as global survival rate ( Figure 4 bD ).\n\n\nDiscussion\nHeterozygous PRKAG2 mutations are responsible for an autosomal dominant muscular glycogenosis with mainly cardiac manifestations, including VPE, conduction defects, and eventually HCM. In this study, we reported four families carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln mutation and five families carrying private mutations, adding three novel pathogenic mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) to the literature. The PRKAG2 – p.Arg302Gln recur- rent mutation was reported in several publications. 13 , 20 It was asso- ciated with an important phenotypic variability between families and even within a same family. In our cohort, all index cases presented a short PR, but the cardiac phenotype could be either asymmetric left ventricle hypertrophy, apical hypertrophy, or biatrial hypertrophy. In patients with sarcomeric HCM, the prevalence of a short PR was not precisely known, but it seems to be not an uncommon find- ing. Nevertheless, as VPE is a common feature of storage diseases (Pompe and Danon diseases, PRKAG2 syndrome) and mitochon- drial disorders (MELAS, MERFF) and a short PR interval without pre-excitation is a common feature in the Anderson-Fabry disease, a precise evaluation of the phenotype of patients is essential.\nThrough a retrospective way, our study of 34 mutation carriers gave us the opportunity to realize a complete analysis of clinical and survival characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report (i) the global pickup rate of PRKAG2 screening according to clinical presentation, (ii) the time-to-event study of the clinical evolution of the disease, and (iii) the genotype – phenotype correl- ation between patients carrying the recurrent p.Arg302Gln muta- tion compared with patients with other mutations.\nMolecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation seems to be recom- mended when patients are diagnosed with an HCM and a VPE, or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). 13 PRKAG2 mutation screening may be discussed as a differential diagnostic of the Fabry disease when the symptom- atology is limited to cardiac signs (the so-called Fabry cardiac vari- ant). 4 Neuromuscular and visceral manifestations are usually diagnosed in patients with the Pompe disease, Danon disease, or other rare glycogenosis. 3 , 5 , 6 They are rarely evoked as differential diagnosis in unexplained adult HCM. In some patients, MRI examin- ation may be useful in addition to ECG and echocardiography in or- der to clarify the presence of fibrosis and inflammation.\nHerein, three new mutations (p.Ser333Pro, p.Val336Ala, and p.His530Arg) were added to the nine previously reported in PRKAG2 . According to the literature, most of these mutations are located in the CBS domains ( Figure 2 ) and were non-synonymous substitutions of conserved residues ( Table 2 ). The p.Glu506Lys was first described in eight patients from a Turkish family. They all presented a WPW syndrome associated with a progressive HCM leading to cardiac failure. 17 Similarly, the three patients from Family 5 harbouring this mutation, and who presented with VPE (one WPW and two isolated short PR intervals), developed a progressive HCM which ended up with cardiac failure (left ventricular ejection fraction between 35 and 40% at 40 years of age). Similarly, the p.Hi- s530Arg found in Family 9 is associated with a severe evolution to cardiac failure since the mother had heart transplantation and her\ndaughter is currently listed for heart graft. In this cohort, 6 patients (out of 24 available data) developed hypokinetic HCM with left ven- tricle ejection fraction below 40%. These six patients were concen- trated in 3 families [Family 5 (2/4), Family 6 (3/4), and Family 1(1/2)]. The associated mutations were Glu506Lys, Val336Ala, and Arg302Gln, respectively. These results evidenced a high rate of patients with HCM evolving towards severe dilated hypokinetic HCM in PRKAG2 mutation carriers (25% in our cohort) in contrast to HCM patients carrying a mutation in one of the sarcomeric genes ( 10%). In a pre- vious study, the p.Arg531Gln mutation was associated with a wide range of severity from asymptomatic adult patients to a severe ante- natal presentation with hypokinetic HCM. 15 In our limited cohort, no significant intrafamilial heterogeneity was identified except for p.Arg302Gln mutation carriers who presented with only a short\nA B C D E Figure 3 Twelve-lead ECG tracings from PRKAG2 -mutated patients.

A trend to a lower risk of developing HCM in patients with the recurrent p.Arg302Gln was also observed.\nIn the literature, the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 syndrome is defined upon four main studies ( Table 2 ). These studies cumulated more than 150 patients originated from 23 families. On average, 25.8% of the patients were asymptomatic, 75% developed a VPE,\nand 66.8% a HCM. Atrioventricular conduction block requiring the implantation of a device were reported in 37.4% of cases. Finally, 5.4% of cases presented with myopathic symptoms. A study on three families was performed and evaluated a global survival of 91% after 12.2 years of follow-up, although the mean age of the pa- tients was not mentioned. 13 As compared with other studies, the\nseverity of the disease in our cohort seemed higher. Overall, 12% of patients were asymptomatic, and global survival at 60 years of age was 67%. These differences may be explained by a higher mean age in our cohort. However, a familial effect may not be excluded in the study of Murphy et al. since 40 out of the 45 patients were from the same family, carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation. 9\nOne of the hallmark symptoms in the PRKAG2 syndrome is the presence of a VPE (WPW or isolated short PR interval). Atypical VPE with decremental AV conduction suggesting fasciculoventricu- lar pathways seems to be frequent in this disorder. 7 , 11 , 12 In the litera- ture, 12% of the cardiac deaths were associated with a short PR interval complication. In this cohort, a VPE was identified in 88% of cases. Most of the ECG tracings and EP testing have been re- analysed by the same cardiologist (19/23). A ‘genuine’ WPW syn- drome has been identified in 3/19 cases. Among the 16/19 remaining cases, an isolated short PR interval was diagnosed. When EP studies were performed, nodoventricular/fasciculoventricular (Mahaim fi- bres) or AV (para-Hisian pathways) were observed, as previously suggested. 9 , 13 Major EP differences between AV accessory pathways and nodofascicular pathways were identified. During programmed right atrial stimulation, nodofascicular pathways had a decremental AV conduction (progressive lengthening of the AH interval), with a contemporary fixed HV interval and a steady shape of the pre- existed ventricular beats. This indicated that AV conduction over the bypass had node-like properties accessory pathways. After the first ablation attempt in Patient II-1 from Family 4 ( Figure 3 B ), the PR interval was prolonged with persisting pre-existed beats meaning that the conduction through the nodofascicular pathway was slightly impaired. The implication of PRKAG2 during cardiac development and annulus fibrosus integrity may argue in favour of fasciculoventri- cular pathways in the PRKAG2 syndrome. PRKAG2 mutations were showed to be associated with the development of periganglionar secondary pathway typed as Mahaim fibres. 11 , 13 , 14 Six patients of this cohort underwent radiofrequency ablation procedures. Whereas none of them had spontaneous or induced junctional tachycardia, accessory pathways ablations were indicated because short refractory periods were identified during EP testing. Most of the accessory pathways had node-like properties and were located near the His bundle. This may explain why all of the ablated patients developed high-degree AVBs following the procedure requiring a device implantation. The absence of junctional tachycardia and the high rate of AVB complications (para-Hisian location) may also ar- gue in favour of the presence of nodoventricular/fasciculoventricu- lar type of accessory pathways.\nThese data reinforce the importance of a systematic evaluation of muscular symptoms for a better delineation of the clinical spectrum of PRKAG2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, molecular screening for PRKAG2 mutation should be discussed when patients are diagnosed with HCM and VPE or when there is a familial history of VPE (WPW syndrome or isolated short PR interval). This study pointed out the severity of PRKAG2 syndrome with both myocardial and rhythm complications. The sur- vival rate was 67% at 60 years of age with an elevated penetrance of symptoms. Ablation procedures should be limited to very symp- tomatic VPE patients as pathways are mainly nodoventricular/fasci- culoventricular and therefore at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank patients and their family members for their cooperation.

Ablation is at high risk for iatrogenic AV conduction blocks. Therefore, proce- dures in these patients should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 9 In this cohort, four patients developed skeletal muscle symptoms. Three of them were complaining of moderate exercise intolerance. These symptoms did not prompt any paraclinical examination since they were attributed to a low cardiac output. The fourth patient de- veloped a muscle pain during exercise with high creatine kinase levels and was previously reported. 20 This skeletal muscle involve- ment may be associated with particular mutations. Indeed, 7/40 (18%) of patients carrying the p.Asn488Ile mutation and 1/4 of pa- tients with p.Ser548Pro mutation developed muscle symptoms. 2 , 20 .... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... ..... ..... .... ..... .....\n\n\nT able 2 Summary of clinical symptoms reported in the liter a tur e a ccording ea ch muta tion\n\n\nMut a tion NM_ 013203.3 p.Arg302Gln p.H is383Arg (p.His142Arg) p.

The expression of keratins is regulated in a tissue-type and differentiation-specific manner [1]. Highly specialized parenchymal epithelial cells, such as tubular cells of the kidney, express only KRT8 and KRT18 in their normal state, but this may change during inflammation, regeneration and also during tumor development. Kidney tubular cells may switch on KRT7 and KRT19 , sometimes also KRT17 in addition to the expression of KRT8 and KRT18 [1]. The increased expression of KRT7 , KRT17 and KRT19 appears parallel to the reduction in degree of differentiation. KRT7 and KRT19 are upregulated during renal epithelial injury and repair leading to more  plasticity of cells involved in the regeneration processes [2]. It was also shown that shift of KRT8 and KRT18 expression to KRT7 and KRT19 is associated with structural remodelling of end stage kidney and increased frequency of tumors expressing both KRT7 and KRT19 [3].  The KRT7 is expressed in papillary renal cell tumors (RCT) and also used in the differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma (RO) and\n\n\nIvyspring\nInternational Publisher\nchromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [4,5]. However, the possible involvement of KRT17 in the biology of kidney cancer is not yet known. Two earlier studies on the keratin expression in distinct types of renal cell cancer using the E3 clone from DAKO did not find KRT17 expression in conventional, chromophobe and papillary renal cell tumors or renal oncocytoma [4,5].\nKRT17 a member of type I acidic epithelial keratin family was first identified in skin basal cell epithelioma and it is considered to be a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin [6]. Expression of KRT17 occurs in complex, multilayered epithelia and it is largely retained during neoplastic transformation leading to several types of cancer derived from such epithelial cells  [7-10].  In the last few years KRT17 expression has also been detected in several tumors of non-epithelial type but not in their tissue of origin. These studies demonstrated a correlation between neo-expression of the KRT17 and tumor progression [11-16]. These findings suggest distinct roles of KRT17 in fetal development, regeneration and tumorigenesis and on the other hand in the progression of frankly malignant cancers.\nIn attempt to learn about the involvement of KRT17 in the biology of renal tumors we applied immunohistochemistry to a large panel of conventional RCC and papillary RCT as well as to preneoplastic lesions (PNL) associated with papillary RCT. In our study we used an antibody arised against the N-terminal protein fragment of KRT17 instead of the E3 clone from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients and tissue samples We have enrolled tumor samples from consecutively operated patients without selection, who undervent radical or partial nephrectomy due to kidney cancer between 2000 and 2013 at the Department of Urology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. The only criteria was the availability of clinical data, follow-up and paraffin embedded tumor material. Data on regular follow-up and tumor-specific death were obtained from the Registry of the Department of Urology. Follow-up was defined as time from operation until the last recorded control in 2018, or cancer-specific death. Patients who died from causes other than RCC were excluded from this analysis. Preoperative clinical staging included abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Bone scans and brain CT scans were obtained only when clinically indicated. The presence of nodal metastases was confirmed by histological, whereas that of distant metastases by radiographic\nexamination. During the postoperative period patients were surveyed every 6 months by abdominal ultrasound scans, serum creatinine and eGFR measurements, and every year by CT scans. Histological diagnoses were performed by a genitourinary pathologist (GK) according to the Heidelberg and TNM classification systems [17,18]. Paraffin embedded material from foetal and adult kidneys were obtained from the archive of the Institute of Pathology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. We have also analysed 17 PNL associated with papillary RCT.  All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.  The collection and use of all tissue samples for this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Pecs, Hungary (No. 5343/2014).\n\n\nTissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemistry\nHaematoxylin and eosin stained slides were reviewed to select the representative paraffin blocks and tumor areas for TMA construction. From each tumor minimum three core biopsies with a diameter of 0.6 mm were placed in the recipient block using a Manual Tissue Arrayer (MTA1, Beecher Instruments, Inc., Sun Prairie, CA, USA).  For marking the TMAs fetal and adult kidney biopsies were included.\nParaffin blocks of fetal and adult  kidneys, pre-neoplastic lesions and TMAs were used for immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinisation and rehydration the 4 um thick sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in 2100-Retriever (Pick-Cell Laboratories, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Endogenous peroxidase activity and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide containing 1% normal horse serum for 15 minutes at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 0 C in a moist chamber with  rabbit polyclonal anti-KRT17 antibody (HPA 000452, lot Nr. A08686, Sigma Aldrich, Budapest, Hungary) at 1:500 dilution. Horse-radish-peroxydase conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse secondary antibody (HISTOLSMR, Histopathology Ltd, Pecs, Hungary) was  applied for 30 minutes at room temperature and the bound antibody was visualized with AEC (Amino-ethyl-carbazol) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).  Tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. In negative control the primary antibody was omitted. The slides were evaluated twice at different times by two of the authors (DPS, GK). The staining intensities were scored as low, medium or high. As we did not find\nsubstantial differences between weak or strong KRT17 expression and conventional RCC progression, we have evaluated all staining intensity as positive.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed using a SPSS Statistics software package version 25 (IBM, 35 Armonk, NY, USA). Correlations between KRT17 expression, clinical and pathological parameters were calculated using the χ 2 test. The effects of the different variables (age, sex, size of tumor, TNM classification, grades, stages, metastases and KRT17 expression) on the survival of the patients were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Comparisons of survival curves were made using the Log rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox regression model. Patients that were alive and disease-free were censored. Differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.\nResults\nExpression of KRT17 in normal fetal and adult kidney The expression of KRT17 first appeared in the ureteric bud and collecting duct of fetal kidney (Figure 1A). There was a weak staining of KRT17 at the tip of the ureteric bud connected to the distal part of the S-shaped body and the staining is intensified along the medullary collecting duct towards the kidney papilla (Figure 1B). In fetal kidney each cell of the collecting duct displayed a positive immunoreaction, no cell type specific selective staining was seen along the tubules. In adult kidney the vast majority but not all cells of the connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts displayed a strong KRT17 staining (Figure 1C). The medullary collecting ducts showed a similar selective staining in the vast majority of cells (Figure 1D). In contrast to the fetal kidney KRT17 expression is restricted to one specific type of epithelial cell in connecting tubules, cortical and medullary collecting ducts of adult kidney. No KRT17 staining was seen in proximal and distal tubules and loop of Henle.\nExpression of KRT17 in papillary RCT and associated PNL We have analyzed the KRT17 expression in PNL associated with papillary RCT including 8 lesions from two patients with germ line MET mutation [17]. The protein encoded by KRT17 was detected in each of the 17 small solid, tubular papillary lesions with 1 to 3 mm in diameter (Figure 1E,F).  A diffuse cytoplasmic staining with increased signal attenuated to the cell membrane was seen in 116 of the 151 papillary RCTs (Figure 1G-I). Altogether, we found\nKRT17 positivity in 77% papillary RCTs irrespectively of the size of tumor cells such as small, medium or large cell which are considered by others as type I and type II or mixed type.\nFigure 1. Representative pictures of KRT17 expression in normal kidney, preneoplastic lesions and papillary RCTs. A: Weak KRT17 positivity at the tip of ureteric bud in connection to the distal part of S-shaped body in foetal kidney. B: Strong KRT17 staining in each cell of the collecting duct of foetal kidney. C: Selective KRT17 staining of cells of the medullary collecting in adult kidney. D: KRT17 positivity in the vast majority of connecting duct cells in adult kidney. E, F: Positive KRT17 reaction in a tubular and papillary preneoplastic lesion, respectively. G-I: Positive staining with KRT17 antibody in small, medium size and large cell papillary renal cell tumours, respectively.\nExpression of KRT17 in conventional RCCs is associated with tumor progression To estimate the role of KRT17 in postoperative tumor relapse, we set up a Cohort of 692 patients without metastatic tumor at the time of operation. The mean age of the entire cohort was 61.1±11.4 years (range 20–88 years), the average follow-up was 60.6±33.2 months. Out of the 692 patients 108 (16%) developed metastasis during the follow-up and died due to metastatic cancer. The clinical parameters and correlation with KRT17 expression is shown in Table 1. In this Cohort 94 tumors (14%) displayed positive KRT17 staining which showed a significant correlation with cancer specific death, tumor size, T-stadium, grade and stage. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with KRT17 positive tumor have a significantly shorter survival than those with negative tumor (Figure 3). The 5-year cancer\nspecific survival rate for the KRT17 positive and negative group was 65.2% and 91.5%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was 36.4% and 78.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between the risk for postoperative tumor recurrence, tumor grade as well as KRT17 positivity (each &lt;0.001). The KRT17 expression was an independent negative survival factor indicating a nearly three times higher risk of disease relapse and cancer specific death (RR=2.50; 95% CI=1.59-3.94; p&lt;0.001).\nTable 1. Association of KRT17 expression with clinical-pathological parameters of conventional RCCs without metastasis at the time of operation (n=692)\nFigure 2. Expression of KRT17 in conventional RCC. A: Lack of expression, B: weak cytoplasmic expression, C: strong KRT17 expression in single tumor cells and D: strong expression in invasive growing tumor cells.\n\n\nDiscussion\nBeyond its role to maintain cellular integrity of multi-layered epithelia KRT17 has other functions as well. KRT17 plays a role in fetal epidermal development and in cell proliferation during wound healing  by  regulation of protein synthesis through intracellular signaling pathways [6, 20]. KRT17 knockout mouse embryos show a delay in closure of surface ectoderm wounds  [21]. KRT17 binds and sequester TRADD (TNFRSF1A associated via death domain), a mediator of programmed cell death signaling and protects the cells from apoptosis [22]. It was also shown that KRT17 null keratinocytes are sensitive to TNF mediated apoptosis [22]. The onset of KRT17 expression in embryonic ectoderm reflects its commitment towards distinct epithelial lineages and that the program of gene expression characteristic of wound-activated adult keratinocyte may have a relationship to that executed by epithelial cells at specific stages of embryonic development  [23]. CD44 +/ KRT17 + cells have stemlike properties, including the capacity for cell renewal and in vivo tumorigenicity [24]. This finding may explain the role of KRT17 in the maintenance and persistance of embryonal structures, e.g. PNL in differentiated kidneys.\nWe showed in this study that KRT17 is expressed in  simple (one-layered) epithelial cells of fetal and adult kidney. Each PNL of embryonal origin as well as 77% of papillary RCT showed the KRT17 positivity irrespectively of cell type. Taking into account that only 5% of papillary RCTs developed metastasis during 5-year follow-up (data not shown), the role of KRT17 in the progression of papillary RCT can be excluded. Rather, the expression of KRT17 in fetal kidney suggests that it may play a role in the cell specific differentiation of tubular cells similarly to its role in fetal epidermal development [6].  The continuous expression from fetal kidney through PNL towards papillary RCT suggests that KRT17 is associated with the development of PNL and subsequently of papillary RCT. This finding indicates a molecular relationship between kidney development and papillary RCT tumorigenesis. The developmental sequences outlined by KRT17 expression support our hypothesis on the unique natural history of papillary RCT [19].\nKRT17 is a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin the expression of which depends on the position of cells in complex multiplayer human epithelia [25]. Expression of KRT17 has been described in bladder carcinoma, keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, premalignant and malignant squamous lesions of the\ncervix, all derived from multilayer epithelial cells [7-10]. In these cases, the tumorigenesis is similar to that we observed for papillary RCT.\nExpression of KRT17 has also been found in several  other  types of cancer such as gastric adenocarcinoma, ovarian and breast carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma but not in their corresponding normal tissue [11-16]. The neo-expression of KRT17 in these cases showed a significant correlation with tumor progression and metastasis. We have identified KRT17 expression in conventional RCCs as an independent negative survival factor indicating a higher risk for postoperative tumour relapse and cancer specific death of patients. Conventional RCC derives from KRT17 negative proximal tubules of the kidney, which suggests that KRT17 has not been involved in the development of conventional RCC. Rather, the neo-expression of KRT17 in conventional RCC can be used as a predictive biomarker similar to gastric, ovarian or breast carcinoma [11-16]. Hu and coworkers [16] demonstrated that silencing of KRT17 in gastric cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo conditions, reduced the migration of tumor cells and induced apoptosis by BCL2 expression. They also showed that silencing KRT17 leads to cell-cycle arrest at G1/S phase of tumor cells. The clinical, pathological as well as experimental data strongly suggest the involvement of KRT17 neo-expression in tumor progression.\nThe key novel findings of this study are, that KRT17 is expressed in a single-layered epithelia, and that papillary RCT and conventional RCC have distinct natural history. The continuous expression of KRT17 from fetal kidney tubules towards papillary RCT in adult confirm the relationship between fetal kidney development  and tumorigenesis of papillary RCT. And finally, the neo-expression of KRT17 in aggressive growing conventional RCC is significantly associated with postoperative tumor relapse. The multiple functions of KRT17 in kidney cancers unequivocally delineates papillary RCTs and conventional RCCs with distinct natural history, which  should be taken into account in clinical managements and therapy.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported  by grants of the Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary (PTE-AOK-KA-2018/16 and EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP- 16-2017-00009).

The expression of keratins is regulated in a tissue-type and differentiation-specific manner [1]. Highly specialized parenchymal epithelial cells, such as tubular cells of the kidney, express only KRT8 and KRT18 in their normal state, but this may change during inflammation, regeneration and also during tumor development. Kidney tubular cells may switch on KRT7 and KRT19 , sometimes also KRT17 in addition to the expression of KRT8 and KRT18 [1]. The increased expression of KRT7 , KRT17 and KRT19 appears parallel to the reduction in degree of differentiation. KRT7 and KRT19 are upregulated during renal epithelial injury and repair leading to more  plasticity of cells involved in the regeneration processes [2]. It was also shown that shift of KRT8 and KRT18 expression to KRT7 and KRT19 is associated with structural remodelling of end stage kidney and increased frequency of tumors expressing both KRT7 and KRT19 [3].  The KRT7 is expressed in papillary renal cell tumors (RCT) and also used in the differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma (RO) and\n\n\nIvyspring\nInternational Publisher\nchromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [4,5]. However, the possible involvement of KRT17 in the biology of kidney cancer is not yet known. Two earlier studies on the keratin expression in distinct types of renal cell cancer using the E3 clone from DAKO did not find KRT17 expression in conventional, chromophobe and papillary renal cell tumors or renal oncocytoma [4,5].\nKRT17 a member of type I acidic epithelial keratin family was first identified in skin basal cell epithelioma and it is considered to be a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin [6]. Expression of KRT17 occurs in complex, multilayered epithelia and it is largely retained during neoplastic transformation leading to several types of cancer derived from such epithelial cells  [7-10].  In the last few years KRT17 expression has also been detected in several tumors of non-epithelial type but not in their tissue of origin. These studies demonstrated a correlation between neo-expression of the KRT17 and tumor progression [11-16]. These findings suggest distinct roles of KRT17 in fetal development, regeneration and tumorigenesis and on the other hand in the progression of frankly malignant cancers.\nIn attempt to learn about the involvement of KRT17 in the biology of renal tumors we applied immunohistochemistry to a large panel of conventional RCC and papillary RCT as well as to preneoplastic lesions (PNL) associated with papillary RCT. In our study we used an antibody arised against the N-terminal protein fragment of KRT17 instead of the E3 clone from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients and tissue samples We have enrolled tumor samples from consecutively operated patients without selection, who undervent radical or partial nephrectomy due to kidney cancer between 2000 and 2013 at the Department of Urology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. The only criteria was the availability of clinical data, follow-up and paraffin embedded tumor material. Data on regular follow-up and tumor-specific death were obtained from the Registry of the Department of Urology. Follow-up was defined as time from operation until the last recorded control in 2018, or cancer-specific death. Patients who died from causes other than RCC were excluded from this analysis. Preoperative clinical staging included abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Bone scans and brain CT scans were obtained only when clinically indicated. The presence of nodal metastases was confirmed by histological, whereas that of distant metastases by radiographic\nexamination. During the postoperative period patients were surveyed every 6 months by abdominal ultrasound scans, serum creatinine and eGFR measurements, and every year by CT scans. Histological diagnoses were performed by a genitourinary pathologist (GK) according to the Heidelberg and TNM classification systems [17,18]. Paraffin embedded material from foetal and adult kidneys were obtained from the archive of the Institute of Pathology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. We have also analysed 17 PNL associated with papillary RCT.  All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.  The collection and use of all tissue samples for this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Pecs, Hungary (No. 5343/2014).\n\n\nTissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemistry\nHaematoxylin and eosin stained slides were reviewed to select the representative paraffin blocks and tumor areas for TMA construction. From each tumor minimum three core biopsies with a diameter of 0.6 mm were placed in the recipient block using a Manual Tissue Arrayer (MTA1, Beecher Instruments, Inc., Sun Prairie, CA, USA).  For marking the TMAs fetal and adult kidney biopsies were included.\nParaffin blocks of fetal and adult  kidneys, pre-neoplastic lesions and TMAs were used for immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinisation and rehydration the 4 um thick sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in 2100-Retriever (Pick-Cell Laboratories, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Endogenous peroxidase activity and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide containing 1% normal horse serum for 15 minutes at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 0 C in a moist chamber with  rabbit polyclonal anti-KRT17 antibody (HPA 000452, lot Nr. A08686, Sigma Aldrich, Budapest, Hungary) at 1:500 dilution. Horse-radish-peroxydase conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse secondary antibody (HISTOLSMR, Histopathology Ltd, Pecs, Hungary) was  applied for 30 minutes at room temperature and the bound antibody was visualized with AEC (Amino-ethyl-carbazol) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).  Tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. In negative control the primary antibody was omitted. The slides were evaluated twice at different times by two of the authors (DPS, GK). The staining intensities were scored as low, medium or high. As we did not find\nsubstantial differences between weak or strong KRT17 expression and conventional RCC progression, we have evaluated all staining intensity as positive.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed using a SPSS Statistics software package version 25 (IBM, 35 Armonk, NY, USA). Correlations between KRT17 expression, clinical and pathological parameters were calculated using the χ 2 test. The effects of the different variables (age, sex, size of tumor, TNM classification, grades, stages, metastases and KRT17 expression) on the survival of the patients were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Comparisons of survival curves were made using the Log rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox regression model. Patients that were alive and disease-free were censored. Differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.\nResults\nExpression of KRT17 in normal fetal and adult kidney The expression of KRT17 first appeared in the ureteric bud and collecting duct of fetal kidney (Figure 1A). There was a weak staining of KRT17 at the tip of the ureteric bud connected to the distal part of the S-shaped body and the staining is intensified along the medullary collecting duct towards the kidney papilla (Figure 1B). In fetal kidney each cell of the collecting duct displayed a positive immunoreaction, no cell type specific selective staining was seen along the tubules. In adult kidney the vast majority but not all cells of the connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts displayed a strong KRT17 staining (Figure 1C). The medullary collecting ducts showed a similar selective staining in the vast majority of cells (Figure 1D). In contrast to the fetal kidney KRT17 expression is restricted to one specific type of epithelial cell in connecting tubules, cortical and medullary collecting ducts of adult kidney. No KRT17 staining was seen in proximal and distal tubules and loop of Henle.\nExpression of KRT17 in papillary RCT and associated PNL We have analyzed the KRT17 expression in PNL associated with papillary RCT including 8 lesions from two patients with germ line MET mutation [17]. The protein encoded by KRT17 was detected in each of the 17 small solid, tubular papillary lesions with 1 to 3 mm in diameter (Figure 1E,F).  A diffuse cytoplasmic staining with increased signal attenuated to the cell membrane was seen in 116 of the 151 papillary RCTs (Figure 1G-I). Altogether, we found\nKRT17 positivity in 77% papillary RCTs irrespectively of the size of tumor cells such as small, medium or large cell which are considered by others as type I and type II or mixed type.\nFigure 1. Representative pictures of KRT17 expression in normal kidney, preneoplastic lesions and papillary RCTs. A: Weak KRT17 positivity at the tip of ureteric bud in connection to the distal part of S-shaped body in foetal kidney. B: Strong KRT17 staining in each cell of the collecting duct of foetal kidney. C: Selective KRT17 staining of cells of the medullary collecting in adult kidney. D: KRT17 positivity in the vast majority of connecting duct cells in adult kidney. E, F: Positive KRT17 reaction in a tubular and papillary preneoplastic lesion, respectively. G-I: Positive staining with KRT17 antibody in small, medium size and large cell papillary renal cell tumours, respectively.\nExpression of KRT17 in conventional RCCs is associated with tumor progression To estimate the role of KRT17 in postoperative tumor relapse, we set up a Cohort of 692 patients without metastatic tumor at the time of operation. The mean age of the entire cohort was 61.1±11.4 years (range 20–88 years), the average follow-up was 60.6±33.2 months. Out of the 692 patients 108 (16%) developed metastasis during the follow-up and died due to metastatic cancer. The clinical parameters and correlation with KRT17 expression is shown in Table 1. In this Cohort 94 tumors (14%) displayed positive KRT17 staining which showed a significant correlation with cancer specific death, tumor size, T-stadium, grade and stage. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with KRT17 positive tumor have a significantly shorter survival than those with negative tumor (Figure 3). The 5-year cancer\nspecific survival rate for the KRT17 positive and negative group was 65.2% and 91.5%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was 36.4% and 78.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between the risk for postoperative tumor recurrence, tumor grade as well as KRT17 positivity (each &lt;0.001). The KRT17 expression was an independent negative survival factor indicating a nearly three times higher risk of disease relapse and cancer specific death (RR=2.50; 95% CI=1.59-3.94; p&lt;0.001).\nTable 1.

KRT17 plays a role in fetal epidermal development and in cell proliferation during wound healing  by  regulation of protein synthesis through intracellular signaling pathways [6, 20]. KRT17 knockout mouse embryos show a delay in closure of surface ectoderm wounds  [21]. KRT17 binds and sequester TRADD (TNFRSF1A associated via death domain), a mediator of programmed cell death signaling and protects the cells from apoptosis [22]. It was also shown that KRT17 null keratinocytes are sensitive to TNF mediated apoptosis [22]. The onset of KRT17 expression in embryonic ectoderm reflects its commitment towards distinct epithelial lineages and that the program of gene expression characteristic of wound-activated adult keratinocyte may have a relationship to that executed by epithelial cells at specific stages of embryonic development  [23]. CD44 +/ KRT17 + cells have stemlike properties, including the capacity for cell renewal and in vivo tumorigenicity [24]. This finding may explain the role of KRT17 in the maintenance and persistance of embryonal structures, e.g. PNL in differentiated kidneys.\nWe showed in this study that KRT17 is expressed in  simple (one-layered) epithelial cells of fetal and adult kidney. Each PNL of embryonal origin as well as 77% of papillary RCT showed the KRT17 positivity irrespectively of cell type. Taking into account that only 5% of papillary RCTs developed metastasis during 5-year follow-up (data not shown), the role of KRT17 in the progression of papillary RCT can be excluded. Rather, the expression of KRT17 in fetal kidney suggests that it may play a role in the cell specific differentiation of tubular cells similarly to its role in fetal epidermal development [6].  The continuous expression from fetal kidney through PNL towards papillary RCT suggests that KRT17 is associated with the development of PNL and subsequently of papillary RCT. This finding indicates a molecular relationship between kidney development and papillary RCT tumorigenesis. The developmental sequences outlined by KRT17 expression support our hypothesis on the unique natural history of papillary RCT [19].\nKRT17 is a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin the expression of which depends on the position of cells in complex multiplayer human epithelia [25]. Expression of KRT17 has been described in bladder carcinoma, keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, premalignant and malignant squamous lesions of the\ncervix, all derived from multilayer epithelial cells [7-10]. In these cases, the tumorigenesis is similar to that we observed for papillary RCT.\nExpression of KRT17 has also been found in several  other  types of cancer such as gastric adenocarcinoma, ovarian and breast carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma but not in their corresponding normal tissue [11-16]. The neo-expression of KRT17 in these cases showed a significant correlation with tumor progression and metastasis. We have identified KRT17 expression in conventional RCCs as an independent negative survival factor indicating a higher risk for postoperative tumour relapse and cancer specific death of patients. Conventional RCC derives from KRT17 negative proximal tubules of the kidney, which suggests that KRT17 has not been involved in the development of conventional RCC. Rather, the neo-expression of KRT17 in conventional RCC can be used as a predictive biomarker similar to gastric, ovarian or breast carcinoma [11-16]. Hu and coworkers [16] demonstrated that silencing of KRT17 in gastric cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo conditions, reduced the migration of tumor cells and induced apoptosis by BCL2 expression. They also showed that silencing KRT17 leads to cell-cycle arrest at G1/S phase of tumor cells. The clinical, pathological as well as experimental data strongly suggest the involvement of KRT17 neo-expression in tumor progression.\nThe key novel findings of this study are, that KRT17 is expressed in a single-layered epithelia, and that papillary RCT and conventional RCC have distinct natural history. The continuous expression of KRT17 from fetal kidney tubules towards papillary RCT in adult confirm the relationship between fetal kidney development  and tumorigenesis of papillary RCT. And finally, the neo-expression of KRT17 in aggressive growing conventional RCC is significantly associated with postoperative tumor relapse. The multiple functions of KRT17 in kidney cancers unequivocally delineates papillary RCTs and conventional RCCs with distinct natural history, which  should be taken into account in clinical managements and therapy.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported  by grants of the Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary (PTE-AOK-KA-2018/16 and EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP- 16-2017-00009).

The mean age of the entire cohort was 61.1±11.4 years (range 20–88 years), the average follow-up was 60.6±33.2 months. Out of the 692 patients 108 (16%) developed metastasis during the follow-up and died due to metastatic cancer. The clinical parameters and correlation with KRT17 expression is shown in Table 1. In this Cohort 94 tumors (14%) displayed positive KRT17 staining which showed a significant correlation with cancer specific death, tumor size, T-stadium, grade and stage. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with KRT17 positive tumor have a significantly shorter survival than those with negative tumor (Figure 3). The 5-year cancer\nspecific survival rate for the KRT17 positive and negative group was 65.2% and 91.5%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was 36.4% and 78.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between the risk for postoperative tumor recurrence, tumor grade as well as KRT17 positivity (each &lt;0.001). The KRT17 expression was an independent negative survival factor indicating a nearly three times higher risk of disease relapse and cancer specific death (RR=2.50; 95% CI=1.59-3.94; p&lt;0.001).\nTable 1.

KRT17 plays a role in fetal epidermal development and in cell proliferation during wound healing  by  regulation of protein synthesis through intracellular signaling pathways [6, 20]. KRT17 knockout mouse embryos show a delay in closure of surface ectoderm wounds  [21]. KRT17 binds and sequester TRADD (TNFRSF1A associated via death domain), a mediator of programmed cell death signaling and protects the cells from apoptosis [22]. It was also shown that KRT17 null keratinocytes are sensitive to TNF mediated apoptosis [22]. The onset of KRT17 expression in embryonic ectoderm reflects its commitment towards distinct epithelial lineages and that the program of gene expression characteristic of wound-activated adult keratinocyte may have a relationship to that executed by epithelial cells at specific stages of embryonic development  [23]. CD44 +/ KRT17 + cells have stemlike properties, including the capacity for cell renewal and in vivo tumorigenicity [24]. This finding may explain the role of KRT17 in the maintenance and persistance of embryonal structures, e.g. PNL in differentiated kidneys.\nWe showed in this study that KRT17 is expressed in  simple (one-layered) epithelial cells of fetal and adult kidney. Each PNL of embryonal origin as well as 77% of papillary RCT showed the KRT17 positivity irrespectively of cell type. Taking into account that only 5% of papillary RCTs developed metastasis during 5-year follow-up (data not shown), the role of KRT17 in the progression of papillary RCT can be excluded. Rather, the expression of KRT17 in fetal kidney suggests that it may play a role in the cell specific differentiation of tubular cells similarly to its role in fetal epidermal development [6].  The continuous expression from fetal kidney through PNL towards papillary RCT suggests that KRT17 is associated with the development of PNL and subsequently of papillary RCT. This finding indicates a molecular relationship between kidney development and papillary RCT tumorigenesis. The developmental sequences outlined by KRT17 expression support our hypothesis on the unique natural history of papillary RCT [19].\nKRT17 is a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin the expression of which depends on the position of cells in complex multiplayer human epithelia [25]. Expression of KRT17 has been described in bladder carcinoma, keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, premalignant and malignant squamous lesions of the\ncervix, all derived from multilayer epithelial cells [7-10]. In these cases, the tumorigenesis is similar to that we observed for papillary RCT.\nExpression of KRT17 has also been found in several  other  types of cancer such as gastric adenocarcinoma, ovarian and breast carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma but not in their corresponding normal tissue [11-16]. The neo-expression of KRT17 in these cases showed a significant correlation with tumor progression and metastasis. We have identified KRT17 expression in conventional RCCs as an independent negative survival factor indicating a higher risk for postoperative tumour relapse and cancer specific death of patients. Conventional RCC derives from KRT17 negative proximal tubules of the kidney, which suggests that KRT17 has not been involved in the development of conventional RCC. Rather, the neo-expression of KRT17 in conventional RCC can be used as a predictive biomarker similar to gastric, ovarian or breast carcinoma [11-16]. Hu and coworkers [16] demonstrated that silencing of KRT17 in gastric cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo conditions, reduced the migration of tumor cells and induced apoptosis by BCL2 expression. They also showed that silencing KRT17 leads to cell-cycle arrest at G1/S phase of tumor cells. The clinical, pathological as well as experimental data strongly suggest the involvement of KRT17 neo-expression in tumor progression.\nThe key novel findings of this study are, that KRT17 is expressed in a single-layered epithelia, and that papillary RCT and conventional RCC have distinct natural history. The continuous expression of KRT17 from fetal kidney tubules towards papillary RCT in adult confirm the relationship between fetal kidney development  and tumorigenesis of papillary RCT. And finally, the neo-expression of KRT17 in aggressive growing conventional RCC is significantly associated with postoperative tumor relapse. The multiple functions of KRT17 in kidney cancers unequivocally delineates papillary RCTs and conventional RCCs with distinct natural history, which  should be taken into account in clinical managements and therapy.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported  by grants of the Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary (PTE-AOK-KA-2018/16 and EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP- 16-2017-00009).

In cancers arising from KRT17 negative single layered epithelia neo-expression of KRT17 has been associated with tumor progression. To obtain more insight into the biology of kidney cancers we have investigated KRT17 expression by immunohistochemistry in normal kidney, in papillary preneoplastic lesions and in 151 papillary and 692 conventional renal cell carcinomas placed on tissue microarray. We found a positive staining in ureteric bud and collecting duct cells in foetal kidney, in all papillary preneoplastic lesions and also in 77% of the 151 papillary renal cell tumors indicating a continuos KRT17 expression during tumor development. The neo-expression of KRT17 in conventional renal cell carcinomas, which derives from KRT17 negative proximal tubules showed a significant correlation with postoperative tumor relapse (RR=2.50; 95% CI=1.59-3.94; p&lt;0.001). In conclusion,  the continuous expression of KRT17 from emerging fetal kidney tubules and microscopic pre-neoplastic lesions towards papillary renal cell tumors and its neo-expression in aggressive growing conventional renal cell carcinomas reflects the multiple function of KRT17 in kidney cancers with distinct  natural history. This  should be taken into account in clinical managements and therapy.\nKey words: KRT17 expression, Kidney cancer, Tumor development, Tumor progression.\n\n\nIntroduction\nKeratins are intermediate filaments playing a crucial role in the integrity and mechanical stability of single epithelial cells and epithelial tissues. The expression of keratins is regulated in a tissue-type and differentiation-specific manner [1]. Highly specialized parenchymal epithelial cells, such as tubular cells of the kidney, express only KRT8 and KRT18 in their normal state, but this may change during inflammation, regeneration and also during tumor development. Kidney tubular cells may switch on KRT7 and KRT19 , sometimes also KRT17 in addition to the expression of KRT8 and KRT18 [1]. The increased expression of KRT7 , KRT17 and KRT19 appears parallel to the reduction in degree of differentiation. KRT7 and KRT19 are upregulated during renal epithelial injury and repair leading to more  plasticity of cells involved in the regeneration processes [2]. It was also shown that shift of KRT8 and KRT18 expression to KRT7 and KRT19 is associated with structural remodelling of end stage kidney and increased frequency of tumors expressing both KRT7 and KRT19 [3].  The KRT7 is expressed in papillary renal cell tumors (RCT) and also used in the differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma (RO) and\n\n\nIvyspring\nInternational Publisher\nchromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [4,5]. However, the possible involvement of KRT17 in the biology of kidney cancer is not yet known. Two earlier studies on the keratin expression in distinct types of renal cell cancer using the E3 clone from DAKO did not find KRT17 expression in conventional, chromophobe and papillary renal cell tumors or renal oncocytoma [4,5].\nKRT17 a member of type I acidic epithelial keratin family was first identified in skin basal cell epithelioma and it is considered to be a basal/myoepithelial cell keratin [6]. Expression of KRT17 occurs in complex, multilayered epithelia and it is largely retained during neoplastic transformation leading to several types of cancer derived from such epithelial cells  [7-10].  In the last few years KRT17 expression has also been detected in several tumors of non-epithelial type but not in their tissue of origin. These studies demonstrated a correlation between neo-expression of the KRT17 and tumor progression [11-16]. These findings suggest distinct roles of KRT17 in fetal development, regeneration and tumorigenesis and on the other hand in the progression of frankly malignant cancers.\nIn attempt to learn about the involvement of KRT17 in the biology of renal tumors we applied immunohistochemistry to a large panel of conventional RCC and papillary RCT as well as to preneoplastic lesions (PNL) associated with papillary RCT. In our study we used an antibody arised against the N-terminal protein fragment of KRT17 instead of the E3 clone from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients and tissue samples We have enrolled tumor samples from consecutively operated patients without selection, who undervent radical or partial nephrectomy due to kidney cancer between 2000 and 2013 at the Department of Urology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. The only criteria was the availability of clinical data, follow-up and paraffin embedded tumor material. Data on regular follow-up and tumor-specific death were obtained from the Registry of the Department of Urology. Follow-up was defined as time from operation until the last recorded control in 2018, or cancer-specific death. Patients who died from causes other than RCC were excluded from this analysis. Preoperative clinical staging included abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Bone scans and brain CT scans were obtained only when clinically indicated. The presence of nodal metastases was confirmed by histological, whereas that of distant metastases by radiographic\nexamination. During the postoperative period patients were surveyed every 6 months by abdominal ultrasound scans, serum creatinine and eGFR measurements, and every year by CT scans. Histological diagnoses were performed by a genitourinary pathologist (GK) according to the Heidelberg and TNM classification systems [17,18]. Paraffin embedded material from foetal and adult kidneys were obtained from the archive of the Institute of Pathology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Hungary. We have also analysed 17 PNL associated with papillary RCT.  All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.  The collection and use of all tissue samples for this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Pecs, Hungary (No. 5343/2014).\n\n\nTissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemistry\nHaematoxylin and eosin stained slides were reviewed to select the representative paraffin blocks and tumor areas for TMA construction. From each tumor minimum three core biopsies with a diameter of 0.6 mm were placed in the recipient block using a Manual Tissue Arrayer (MTA1, Beecher Instruments, Inc., Sun Prairie, CA, USA).  For marking the TMAs fetal and adult kidney biopsies were included.\nParaffin blocks of fetal and adult  kidneys, pre-neoplastic lesions and TMAs were used for immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinisation and rehydration the 4 um thick sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in 2100-Retriever (Pick-Cell Laboratories, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Endogenous peroxidase activity and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide containing 1% normal horse serum for 15 minutes at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 0 C in a moist chamber with  rabbit polyclonal anti-KRT17 antibody (HPA 000452, lot Nr. A08686, Sigma Aldrich, Budapest, Hungary) at 1:500 dilution. Horse-radish-peroxydase conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse secondary antibody (HISTOLSMR, Histopathology Ltd, Pecs, Hungary) was  applied for 30 minutes at room temperature and the bound antibody was visualized with AEC (Amino-ethyl-carbazol) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).  Tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. In negative control the primary antibody was omitted. The slides were evaluated twice at different times by two of the authors (DPS, GK). The staining intensities were scored as low, medium or high. As we did not find\nsubstantial differences between weak or strong KRT17 expression and conventional RCC progression, we have evaluated all staining intensity as positive.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed using a SPSS Statistics software package version 25 (IBM, 35 Armonk, NY, USA). Correlations between KRT17 expression, clinical and pathological parameters were calculated using the χ 2 test. The effects of the different variables (age, sex, size of tumor, TNM classification, grades, stages, metastases and KRT17 expression) on the survival of the patients were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Comparisons of survival curves were made using the Log rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox regression model. Patients that were alive and disease-free were censored. Differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.\nResults\nExpression of KRT17 in normal fetal and adult kidney The expression of KRT17 first appeared in the ureteric bud and collecting duct of fetal kidney (Figure 1A). There was a weak staining of KRT17 at the tip of the ureteric bud connected to the distal part of the S-shaped body and the staining is intensified along the medullary collecting duct towards the kidney papilla (Figure 1B). In fetal kidney each cell of the collecting duct displayed a positive immunoreaction, no cell type specific selective staining was seen along the tubules. In adult kidney the vast majority but not all cells of the connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts displayed a strong KRT17 staining (Figure 1C). The medullary collecting ducts showed a similar selective staining in the vast majority of cells (Figure 1D). In contrast to the fetal kidney KRT17 expression is restricted to one specific type of epithelial cell in connecting tubules, cortical and medullary collecting ducts of adult kidney. No KRT17 staining was seen in proximal and distal tubules and loop of Henle.\nExpression of KRT17 in papillary RCT and associated PNL We have analyzed the KRT17 expression in PNL associated with papillary RCT including 8 lesions from two patients with germ line MET mutation [17]. The protein encoded by KRT17 was detected in each of the 17 small solid, tubular papillary lesions with 1 to 3 mm in diameter (Figure 1E,F).  A diffuse cytoplasmic staining with increased signal attenuated to the cell membrane was seen in 116 of the 151 papillary RCTs (Figure 1G-I). Altogether, we found\nKRT17 positivity in 77% papillary RCTs irrespectively of the size of tumor cells such as small, medium or large cell which are considered by others as type I and type II or mixed type.\nFigure 1. Representative pictures of KRT17 expression in normal kidney, preneoplastic lesions and papillary RCTs.

G-I: Positive staining with KRT17 antibody in small, medium size and large cell papillary renal cell tumours, respectively.\nExpression of KRT17 in conventional RCCs is associated with tumor progression To estimate the role of KRT17 in postoperative tumor relapse, we set up a Cohort of 692 patients without metastatic tumor at the time of operation. The mean age of the entire cohort was 61.1±11.4 years (range 20–88 years), the average follow-up was 60.6±33.2 months. Out of the 692 patients 108 (16%) developed metastasis during the follow-up and died due to metastatic cancer. The clinical parameters and correlation with KRT17 expression is shown in Table 1. In this Cohort 94 tumors (14%) displayed positive KRT17 staining which showed a significant correlation with cancer specific death, tumor size, T-stadium, grade and stage. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with KRT17 positive tumor have a significantly shorter survival than those with negative tumor (Figure 3). The 5-year cancer\nspecific survival rate for the KRT17 positive and negative group was 65.2% and 91.5%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was 36.4% and 78.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between the risk for postoperative tumor recurrence, tumor grade as well as KRT17 positivity (each &lt;0.001). The KRT17 expression was an independent negative survival factor indicating a nearly three times higher risk of disease relapse and cancer specific death (RR=2.50; 95% CI=1.59-3.94; p&lt;0.001).\nTable 1.
