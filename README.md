One thousand years ago, Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039 AD) was arguably the first human being to use experimental evidence to explicitly understand a system scientifically. He was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning—an early pioneer in the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham)). This system is based on the latinized form of his name, and is geared towards using generative AI technology to perform scientific reasoning over the extant body of knowledge we have access to in the world today.
