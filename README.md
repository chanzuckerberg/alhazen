# Alhazen

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is an early proof-of-concept prototype developed within CZI’s
Research Science Team (RST). It is intended to be used as a downloadable
library that can be run on a high-end local machine (M2 Apple Macbook
with 32+GB of memory - no support for Windows or Linux yet).

## Installation

### Install from source

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/alzhazen
conda create -n alhazen python=3.11
conda activate alhazen
cd alhazen
pip install -e .
```

## Other dependencies

### Ollama

The tool uses the [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) library to execute large
language models locally on your machine. Note that to able to run the
best performing models on a Apple Mac M1 or M2 machine, you will need at
least 48GB of memory.

## How to use

We use the fire library to create a modular command line interface (CLI)
for Alhazen.

For example to run the chatbot for the single paper QA task, execute the
following command:

``` bash
python -m fire alhazen.apps <tool_name> <tool_args>
```

for example, run the following command to chat with the single paper QA
chatbot:

``` bash
python -m fire alhazen.apps single_paper_chatbot '/path/to/pdf/or/nxml/files/' 'mistral-7b-instruct'`
```

## Code Status and Capabilities

This project is still very early, but we are attempting to provide
access to the full range of capabilities of the project as we develop
them. We will provide some access to each capability through
[Gradio](https://gradio.app/) as we develop them, and will eventually
synthesise them into a single agent-driven interface.

## Where does the Name ‘Alhazen’ come from?

One thousand years ago, Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039 AD) studied
optics through experimentation and observation. He advocated that a
hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable
procedures or mathematical reasoning — an early pioneer in the
scientific method *five centuries* before Renaissance scientists started
following the same paradigm ([Website](https://www.ibnalhaytham.com/),
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham), [Tbakhi &
Amir 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074172/)).

We use the latinized form of his name (‘Alhazen’) to honor his
contribution (which goes largely unrecognized from within non-Islamic
communities).

Famously, he was quoted as saying:

> The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if
> learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all
> that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its
> content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as
> he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid
> falling into either prejudice or leniency.

Here, we seek to develop an AI capable of applying scientific knowledge
engineering to support CZI’s mission. We seek to honor Ibn al-Haytham’s
critical view of published knowledge by creating a AI-powered system for
scientific discovery.

Note - when describing our agent, we will use non-gendered pronouns
(they/them/it) to refer to the agent.
