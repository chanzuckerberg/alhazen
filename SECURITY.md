# Reporting Security Issues

The CZI team and community take security bugs in `alhazen` seriously. 
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, 
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. 

To report a security issue, email security@chanzuckerberg.com and include the word "SECURITY" 
in the subject line.

The CZI team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. 
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the 
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

The Alhazen toolkit is intended as research-level code to enable agent-based investigation  
over extant scientific knowledge in the wider community.
