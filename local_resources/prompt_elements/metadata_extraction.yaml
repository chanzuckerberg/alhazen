cryoet: 
  methodology: Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET)
  method goal: study the microscopic structure of a biological sample
  all protocol steps:
    (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.),
    (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample,
    (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella.
    (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles.
    (E) reconstructing 3-D tomograms in by aligning tilt series and performing reconstruction computations.
    (F) annotating the 3D model of the sample to identify structures of interest.
    (G) other protocol steps, not listed above. 
  all protocol step codes: A, B, C, D, E, F, or G
  all entities:
    (A) the biological sample, 
    (B) the frozen biological sample, 
    (C) the lamella, 
    (D) the mounted sample, 
    (E) the tilt series, 
    (F) the tomogram, 
    (G) the annotation set
