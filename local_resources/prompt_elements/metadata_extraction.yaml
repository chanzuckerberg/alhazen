        Is single cell RNA / gene expression data used in this paper?
        To answer this question, pay attention to the papers' methods and results. 
        If methods of single cell isolation, RNA extraction, and sequencing are described it is likely that single cell RNA data was used.
        Similarly, if methods such as scRNAseq, STRT-seq, MARS-seq or any derivates are used, it is likely that single cell RNA data was used.
        Provide a True/False answer to this question. If you are unsure, respond 'Unknown'.
