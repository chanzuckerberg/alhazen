Although previous reports suggest that developmental signaling pathways such as FGF and PDGF are reused in adult heart regeneration, the underlying intracellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that H2O2 acts as a novel epicardial and myocardial signal to prime the heart for regeneration in adult zebrafish. Live imaging of intact hearts revealed highly localized H2O2 (~30 μM) production in the epicardium and adjacent compact myocardium at the resection site. Decreasing H2O2 formation with the Duox inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or apocynin, or scavenging H2O2 by catalase overexpression markedly impaired cardiac regeneration while exogenous H2O2 rescued the inhibitory effects of DPI on cardiac regeneration, indicating that H2O2 is an essential and sufficient signal in this process. Mechanistically, elevated H2O2 destabilized the redox-sensitive phosphatase Dusp6 and hence increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. The Dusp6 inhibitor BCI achieved similar pro-regenerative effects while transgenic overexpression of dusp6 impaired cardiac regeneration. H2O2 plays a dual role in recruiting immune cells and promoting heart regeneration through two relatively independent pathways. We conclude that H2O2 potentially generated from Duox/Nox2 promotes heart regeneration in zebrafish by unleashing MAP kinase signaling through a derepression mechanism involving Dusp6.	2014-09	2024-03-06 19:49:29	2024-03-06T19:49:29Z		1091-1107		9	24		Cell Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25124925 PMCID: PMC4152734					Animals; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Heart; Hydrogen Peroxide; In Vitro Techniques; Leukocytes; Models, Biological; Myocardium; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteolysis; Regeneration; Repressor Proteins; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitination; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Hyperinsulinemia induces insulin resistance and immune suppression via Ptpn6/Shp1 in zebrafish	The Journal of Endocrinology		1479-6805	10.1530/JOE-14-0178		Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are pathologies where insulin resistance plays a central role, and that affect a large population worldwide. These pathologies are usually associated with a dysregulation of insulin secretion leading to a chronic exposure of the tissues to high insulin levels (i.e. hyperinsulinemia), which diminishes the concentration of key downstream elements, causing insulin resistance. The complexity of the study of insulin resistance arises from the heterogeneity of the metabolic states where it is observed. To contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms triggering insulin resistance, we have developed a zebrafish model to study insulin metabolism and its associated disorders. Zebrafish larvae appeared to be sensitive to human recombinant insulin, becoming insulin-resistant when exposed to a high dose of the hormone. Moreover RNA-seq-based transcriptomic profiling of these larvae revealed a strong downregulation of a number of immune-relevant genes as a consequence of the exposure to hyperinsulinemia. Interestingly, as an exception, the negative immune modulator protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 6 (ptpn6) appeared to be upregulated in insulin-resistant larvae. Knockdown of ptpn6 was found to counteract the observed downregulation of the immune system and insulin signaling pathway caused by hyperinsulinemia. These results indicate that ptpn6 is a mediator of the metabolic switch between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant states. Our zebrafish model for hyperinsulinemia has therefore demonstrated its suitability for discovery of novel regulators of insulin resistance. In addition, our data will be very useful in further studies of the function of immunological determinants in a non-obese model system.	2014-08	2024-03-06 19:49:29	2024-03-06T19:49:29Z		229-241		2	222		J Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24904114					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Hyperinsulinism; Immunity; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Larva; Leptin; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; hyperinsulinemia; immune suppression; insulin resistance; ptpn6; zebrafish

Phagocytosis of mycobacteria by zebrafish macrophages is dependent on the scavenger receptor Marco, a key control factor of pro-inflammatory signalling	Developmental and Comparative Immunology		1879-0089	10.1016/j.dci.2014.07.022		Scavenger receptors on the cell surface of macrophages play an important role in host defence through their ability to bind microbial ligands and induce phagocytosis. Concurrently, signal transduction pathways are initiated that aid in defence mechanisms against the invading microbe. Here we report on the function of scavenger receptor Marco (Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) during infection of zebrafish embryos with Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of M. tuberculosis. Morpholino knockdown demonstrates that Marco is required for the rapid phagocytosis of M. marinum following intravenous infection. Furthermore, gene expression analysis shows that Marco controls the initial transient pro-inflammatory response to M. marinum and remains a determining factor for the immune response signature at later stages of infection. Increased bacterial burden following marco knockdown indicates that this scavenger receptor is important for control of M. marinum growth, likely due to delayed phagocytosis and reduced pro-inflammatory signalling observed under conditions of Marco deficiency.	2014-12	2024-03-06 19:49:29	2024-03-06T19:49:29Z		223-233		2	47		Dev Comp Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25086293					Animals; Bacterial Load; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Immunity, Innate; Infection; Innate immunity; Macrophages; Marco; Morpholinos; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Phagocytosis; Receptors, Scavenger; Scavenger receptor; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

Activating transcription factor 6 is necessary and sufficient for alcoholic fatty liver disease in zebrafish	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1004335		Fatty liver disease (FLD) is characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is accompanied by secretory pathway dysfunction, resulting in induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), one of three main UPR sensors, functions to both promote FLD during acute stress and reduce FLD during chronic stress. There is little mechanistic understanding of how ATF6, or any other UPR factor, regulates hepatic lipid metabolism to cause disease. We addressed this using zebrafish genetics and biochemical analyses and demonstrate that Atf6 is necessary and sufficient for FLD. atf6 transcription is significantly upregulated in the liver of zebrafish with alcoholic FLD and morpholino-mediated atf6 depletion significantly reduced steatosis incidence caused by alcohol. Moreover, overexpression of active, nuclear Atf6 (nAtf6) in hepatocytes caused FLD in the absence of stress. mRNA-Seq and qPCR analyses of livers from five day old nAtf6 transgenic larvae revealed upregulation of genes promoting glyceroneogenesis and fatty acid elongation, including fatty acid synthase (fasn), and nAtf6 overexpression in both zebrafish larvae and human hepatoma cells increased the incorporation of 14C-acetate into lipids. Srebp transcription factors are key regulators of lipogenic enzymes, but reducing Srebp activation by scap morpholino injection neither prevented FLD in nAtf6 transgenics nor synergized with atf6 knockdown to reduce alcohol-induced FLD. In contrast, fasn morpholino injection reduced FLD in nAtf6 transgenic larvae and synergistically interacted with atf6 to reduce alcoholic FLD. Thus, our data demonstrate that Atf6 is required for alcoholic FLD and epistatically interacts with fasn to cause this disease, suggesting triglyceride biogenesis as the mechanism of UPR induced FLD.	2014	2024-03-06 19:49:28	2024-03-06T19:49:28Z		e1004335		5	10		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24874946 PMCID: PMC4038464					Activating Transcription Factor 6; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease Models, Animal; Ethanol; Fatty Liver, Alcoholic; Hepatocytes; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish

Expanding the annotation of zebrafish microRNAs based on small RNA sequencing	Gene		1879-0038	10.1016/j.gene.2014.05.036		MicroRNAs (miRs) are short non-coding RNAs that fine-tune the regulation of gene expression to coordinate a wide range of biological processes. Because of their role in the regulation of gene expression, miRs are essential players in development by acting on cell fate determination and progression towards cell differentiation and are increasingly relevant to human health and disease. Although the zebrafish Danio rerio is a major model for studies of development, genetics, physiology, evolution, and human biology, the annotation of zebrafish miR-producing genes remains limited. In the present work, we report deep sequencing data of zebrafish small RNAs from brain, heart, testis, and ovary. Results provide evidence for the expression of 56 un-annotated mir genes and 248 un-annotated mature strands, increasing the number of zebrafish mir genes over those already deposited in miRBase by 16% and the number of mature sequences by 63%. We also describe the existence of three pairs of mirror-mir genes and two mirtron genes, genetic features previously undescribed in non-mammalian vertebrates. This report provides information that substantially increases our knowledge of the zebrafish miRNome and will benefit the entire miR community.	2014-08-10	2024-03-06 19:49:28	2024-03-06T19:49:28Z		386-389		2	546		Gene								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24835514 PMCID: PMC4130647					Animals; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mirror-mir; Mirtron; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Teleost; Zebrafish; miRNA; smallRNA-seq

However, nonmammalian animals (e.g., birds, amphibians, and fish) regenerate damaged hair cells. To understand better the reasons underpinning such disparities in regeneration among vertebrates, we set out to define at high resolution the changes in gene expression associated with the regeneration of hair cells in the zebrafish lateral line. We performed RNA-Seq analyses on regenerating support cells purified by FACS. The resulting expression data were subjected to pathway enrichment analyses, and the differentially expressed genes were validated in vivo via whole-mount in situ hybridizations. We discovered that cell cycle regulators are expressed hours before the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling following hair cell death. We propose that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is not involved in regulating the onset of proliferation but governs proliferation at later stages of regeneration. In addition, and in marked contrast to mammals, our data clearly indicate that the Notch pathway is significantly down-regulated shortly after injury, thus uncovering a key difference between the zebrafish and mammalian responses to hair cell injury. Taken together, our findings lay the foundation for identifying differences in signaling pathway regulation that could be exploited as potential therapeutic targets to promote either sensory epithelium or hair cell regeneration in mammals.	2014-04-08	2024-03-06 19:49:28	2024-03-06T19:49:28Z		E1383-1392		14	111		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24706903 PMCID: PMC3986165					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, cdc; Hair Cells, Auditory; Jak/Stat3; Neomycin; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA sequencing; Receptors, Notch; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Wnt Proteins; Zebrafish; beta Catenin; cdkn1b; neuromast; signaling pathway analysis

In the current study, comparative transcriptomic approaches were used to examine the correlation of the three induced transgenic liver cancers with human liver cancers. RNA profiles from the three zebrafish tumors indicated relatively small overlaps of significantly deregulated genes and biological pathways. Nevertheless, the three transgenic tumor signatures all showed significant correlation with advanced or very advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, molecular signature from each oncogene-induced zebrafish liver tumor correlated with only a small subset of human HCC samples (24-29%) and there were conserved up-regulated pathways between the zebrafish and correlated human HCC subgroup. The three zebrafish liver cancer models together represented nearly half (47.2%) of human HCCs while some human HCCs showed significant correlation with more than one signature defined from the three oncogene-addicted zebrafish tumors. In contrast, commonly deregulated genes (21 up and 16 down) in the three zebrafish tumor models generally showed accordant deregulation in the majority of human HCCs, suggesting that these genes might be more consistently deregulated in a broad range of human HCCs with different molecular mechanisms and thus serve as common diagnosis markers and therapeutic targets. Thus, these transgenic zebrafish models with well-defined oncogene-induced tumors are valuable tools for molecular classification of human HCCs and for understanding of molecular drivers in hepatocarcinogenesis in each human HCC subgroup.	2014	2024-03-06 19:49:28	2024-03-06T19:49:28Z		e91179		3	9		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24633177 PMCID: PMC3954698					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, ras; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Zebrafish

The nature and causative relationship of the DNA sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most TSSs by RNA polymerase II remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition represents the most marked change of the transcriptome repertoire in the vertebrate life cycle. Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the tenth cell cycle, marking the mid-blastula transition. This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of TSS selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed TSS usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression, and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes. Here we show that the transition from the maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of TSS usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific TSS selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic TSS selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (+1) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveal their DNA-sequence-associated positioning at promoters before zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription-independent adjustment to the final position downstream of the zygotic TSS. The two TSS-defining grammars coexist, often physically overlapping, in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts.	2014-03-20	2024-03-06 19:49:27	2024-03-06T19:49:27Z		381-385		7492	507		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24531765 PMCID: PMC4820030					Animals; Base Sequence; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Histones; Methylation; Mothers; Nucleosomes; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Initiation Site; Transcription Initiation, Genetic; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zygote

Minor class splicing shapes the zebrafish transcriptome during development	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1305536111		Minor class or U12-type splicing is a highly conserved process required to remove a minute fraction of introns from human pre-mRNAs. Defects in this splicing pathway have recently been linked to human disease, including a severe developmental disorder encompassing brain and skeletal abnormalities known as Taybi-Linder syndrome or microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism 1, and a hereditary intestinal polyposis condition, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Although a key mechanism for regulating gene expression, the impact of impaired U12-type splicing on the transcriptome is unknown. Here, we describe a unique zebrafish mutant, caliban (clbn), with arrested development of the digestive organs caused by an ethylnitrosourea-induced recessive lethal point mutation in the rnpc3 [RNA-binding region (RNP1, RRM) containing 3] gene. rnpc3 encodes the zebrafish ortholog of human RNPC3, also known as the U11/U12 di-snRNP 65-kDa protein, a unique component of the U12-type spliceosome. The biochemical impact of the mutation in clbn is the formation of aberrant U11- and U12-containing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins that impair the efficiency of U12-type splicing. Using RNA sequencing and microarrays, we show that multiple genes involved in various steps of mRNA processing, including transcription, splicing, and nuclear export are disrupted in clbn, either through intron retention or differential gene expression. Thus, clbn provides a useful and specific model of aberrant U12-type splicing in vivo. Analysis of its transcriptome reveals efficient mRNA processing as a critical process for the growth and proliferation of cells during vertebrate development.	2014-02-25	2024-03-06 19:49:27	2024-03-06T19:49:27Z		3062-3067		8	111		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24516132 PMCID: PMC3939875					Animals; Base Sequence; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Intestines; Liver; Microarray Analysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Pancreas; Point Mutation; Protein Conformation; RNA Splicing; RNA, Small Nuclear; RNA-Binding Proteins; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Spliceosomes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

UHRF1 overexpression drives DNA hypomethylation and hepatocellular carcinoma	Cancer Cell		1878-3686	10.1016/j.ccr.2014.01.003		Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is an essential regulator of DNA methylation that is highly expressed in many cancers. Here, we use transgenic zebrafish, cultured cells, and human tumors to demonstrate that UHRF1 is an oncogene. UHRF1 overexpression in zebrafish hepatocytes destabilizes and delocalizes Dnmt1 and causes DNA hypomethylation and Tp53-mediated senescence. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerges when senescence is bypassed. tp53 mutation both alleviates senescence and accelerates tumor onset. Human HCCs recapitulate this paradigm, as UHRF1 overexpression defines a subclass of aggressive HCCs characterized by genomic instability, TP53 mutation, and abrogation of the TP53-mediated senescence program. We propose that UHRF1 overexpression is a mechanism underlying DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells and that senescence is a primary means of restricting tumorigenesis due to epigenetic disruption.	2014-02-10	2024-03-06 19:49:26	2024-03-06T19:49:26Z		196-209		2	25		Cancer Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24486181 PMCID: PMC3951208					Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cells, Cultured; Cellular Senescence; Cohort Studies; Computational Biology; DNA Methylation; Hepatocytes; Humans; Immunoblotting; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Zebrafish

Poly(A)-tail profiling reveals an embryonic switch in translational control	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature13007		Poly(A) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function. Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.	2014-04-03	2024-03-06 19:49:26	2024-03-06T19:49:26Z		66-71		7494	508		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24476825 PMCID: PMC4086860					Animals; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Drosophila melanogaster; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Liver; Mice; MicroRNAs; Models, Genetic; Plant Leaves; Poly A; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Ribosomes; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Species Specificity; Transcription, Genetic; Xenopus; Yeasts; Zebrafish; Zygote

The earliest transcribed zygotic genes are short, newly evolved, and different across species	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2013.12.030		The transition from maternal to zygotic control is fundamental to the life cycle of all multicellular organisms. It is widely believed that genomes are transcriptionally inactive from fertilization until zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Thus, the earliest genes expressed probably support the rapid cell divisions that precede morphogenesis and, if so, might be evolutionarily conserved. Here, we identify the earliest zygotic transcripts in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, through metabolic labeling and purification of RNA from staged embryos. Surprisingly, the mitochondrial genome was highly active from the one-cell stage onwards, showing that significant transcriptional activity exists at fertilization. We show that 592 nuclear genes become active when cell cycles are still only 15 min long, confining expression to relatively short genes. Furthermore, these zygotic genes are evolutionarily younger than those expressed at other developmental stages. Comparison of fish, fly, and mouse data revealed different sets of genes expressed at ZGA. This species specificity uncovers an evolutionary plasticity in early embryogenesis that probably confers substantial adaptive potential.	2014-01-30	2024-03-06 19:49:26	2024-03-06T19:49:26Z		285-292		2	6		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24440719					Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Mitochondrial; RNA, Messenger; Species Specificity; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zygote

Shirley	Canonical nucleosome organization at promoters forms during genome activation	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.157750.113		The organization of nucleosomes influences transcriptional activity by controlling accessibility of DNA binding proteins to the genome. Genome-wide nucleosome binding profiles have identified a canonical nucleosome organization at gene promoters, where arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes emanate from nucleosome-depleted regions. The mechanisms of formation and the function of canonical promoter nucleosome organization remain unclear. Here we analyze the genome-wide location of nucleosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis and show that well-positioned nucleosome arrays appear on thousands of promoters during the activation of the zygotic genome. The formation of canonical promoter nucleosome organization is independent of DNA sequence preference, transcriptional elongation, and robust RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Instead, canonical promoter nucleosome organization correlates with the presence of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and affects future transcriptional activation. These findings reveal that genome activation is central to the organization of nucleosome arrays during early embryogenesis.	2014-02	2024-03-06 19:49:25	2024-03-06T19:49:25Z		260-266		2	24		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24285721 PMCID: PMC3912416					Animals; DNA-Binding Proteins; Embryonic Development; Genome; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Nucleosomes; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA Polymerase II; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish

However, the information on TCDD-induced toxicity in other molecular pathways is rather limited. To fully understand molecular toxicity of TCDD in an in vivo animal model, adult zebrafish were exposed to TCDD at 10 nM for 96 h and the livers were sampled for RNA-sequencing based transcriptomic profiling. A total of 1,058 differently expressed genes were identified based on fold-change>2 and TPM (transcripts per million) >10. Among the top 20 up-regulated genes, 10 novel responsive genes were identified and verified by RT-qPCR analysis on independent samples. Transcriptomic analysis indicated several deregulated pathways associated with cell cycle, endocrine disruptors, signal transduction and immune systems. Comparative analyses of TCDD-induced transcriptomic changes between fish and mammalian models revealed that proteomic pathway is consistently up-regulated while calcium signaling pathway and several immune-related pathways are generally down-regulated. Finally, our study also suggested that zebrafish model showed greater similarity to in vivo mammalian models than in vitro models. Our study indicated that the zebrafish is a valuable in vivo model in toxicogenomic analyses for understanding molecular toxicity of environmental toxicants relevant to human health. The expression profiles associated with TCDD could be useful for monitoring environmental dioxin and dioxin-like contamination.	2013	2024-03-06 19:49:25	2024-03-06T19:49:25Z		e77292		10	8		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24204792 PMCID: PMC3813628					Animals; Cell Cycle; Databases, Genetic; Environmental Pollutants; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Liver; Male; Mammals; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Its deregulation leads to congenital heart disease. However, little is known regarding its regulation. Here we isolate a zebrafish mutant with heart malformations, called 34c. The affected gene is identified as kctd10, a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD)-containing family. In the mutant, the expressions of the atrioventricular canal marker genes, such as tbx2b, hyaluronan synthase 2 (has2), notch1b and bmp4, are changed. The knockdown of tbx5 rescues the ectopic expression of has2, and knockdown of either tbx5a or has2 alleviates the heart defects. We show that Kctd10 directly binds to Tbx5 to repress its transcriptional activity. Our results reveal a new essential factor for cardiac development and suggest that KCTD10 could be considered as a new causative gene of congenital heart disease.	2014	2024-03-06 19:49:25	2024-03-06T19:49:25Z		3153			5		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24430697					Animals; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Morphogenesis; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the biogenesis of miR-451, an erythropoietic miRNA conserved in vertebrates, occurs independently of Dicer and instead requires cleavage of the 3' arm of the pre-miR-451 precursor hairpin by Ago2. The 3' end of the Ago2-cleaved pre-miR-451 intermediate is then trimmed to the mature length by an unknown nuclease. Here, using a classical chromatographic approach, we identified poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) as the enzyme responsible for the 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming of Ago2-cleaved pre-miR-451. Surprisingly, our data show that trimming of Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNAs is not essential for target silencing, indicating that RISC is functional with miRNAs longer than the mature length. Our findings define the maturation step in the miRNA biogenesis pathway that depends on Ago2-mediated cleavage.	2013-11-14	2024-03-06 19:49:25	2024-03-06T19:49:25Z		715-726		3	5		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24209750 PMCID: PMC3856240					Amino Acid Sequence; Argonaute Proteins; Exoribonucleases; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; K562 Cells; MicroRNAs; Molecular Sequence Data; Transfection

Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 activate zygotic gene expression during the maternal-to-zygotic transition	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature12632		After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.	2013-11-21	2024-03-06 19:49:24	2024-03-06T19:49:24Z		360-364		7476	503		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24056933 PMCID: PMC3925760					Animals; Cellular Reprogramming; Embryonic Development; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Homeodomain Proteins; MicroRNAs; Mothers; Nanog Homeobox Protein; Octamer Transcription Factor-3; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Ribosomes; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

We identified genes expressed in lateral mesoderm that are dysregulated in zebrafish when both gata5 and gata6 are depleted, causing a block to cardiomyocyte specification. This screen identified tmem88a, which is expressed in the early cardiac progenitor field and was previously implicated in WNT modulation by overexpression studies. Depletion of tmem88a results in a profound cardiomyopathy, secondary to impaired cardiomyocyte specification. In tmem88a morphants, activation of the WNT pathway exacerbates the cardiomyocyte deficiency, whereas WNT inhibition rescues progenitor cells and cardiogenesis. We conclude that specification of cardiac fate downstream of gata5/6 involves activation of the tmem88a gene to constrain WNT signaling and expand the number of cardiac progenitors. Tmem88a is a novel component of the regulatory mechanism controlling the second phase of biphasic WNT activity essential for embryonic cardiogenesis.	2013-09	2024-03-06 19:49:24	2024-03-06T19:49:24Z		3787-3798		18	140		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23903195 PMCID: PMC3754477					Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Body Patterning; Cardiac fate; Cardiomyopathies; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; GATA Transcription Factors; GATA5 Transcription Factor; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Association Studies; Heart development; Lineage commitment; Membrane Proteins; Mesoderm; Morpholinos; Mutation; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organogenesis; Phenotype; RNA Transport; RNA, Messenger; Stem Cells; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

MicroRNA-146 function in the innate immune transcriptome response of zebrafish embryos to Salmonella typhimurium infection	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/1471-2164-14-696		BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been shown to play important roles in development of the immune system and in fine-tuning of immune responses. Human miR-146 family members are known as inflammation-inducible miRNAs involved in negative feedback regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling. Dysregulation of the miR-146 family has often been linked to inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This study reports on miR-146a and miR-146b as infection-inducible miRNAs in zebrafish, which has emerged as a model species for human disease. RESULTS: Using a custom-designed microarray platform for miRNA expression we found that both members of the zebrafish miR-146 family, miR-146a and miR-146b, were commonly induced by infection of zebrafish embryos with Salmonella typhimurium and by infection of adult fish with Mycobacterium marinum. The induction of these miRNAs was confirmed by Taqman miRNA assays. Subsequently, we used zebrafish embryos, in which adaptive immunity is not yet active, as an in vivo system to investigate the role of miR-146 in the innate immune response to S. typhimurium infection. Knockdown of traf6 and use of myd88 mutants demonstrated that the induction of miR-146a and miR-146b by S. typhimurium infection was affected by disruption of the MyD88-Traf6 pathway that mediates transduction of TLR signals and cytokine responses. In turn, knockdown of miR-146 itself had no major effects on the expression of known targets of MyD88-Traf6 signalling. Instead, RNA sequencing analysis showed that miR-146 knockdown led to an increased induction of six members of the apolipoprotein gene family in S. typhimurium-infected embryos. CONCLUSION: Based on microarray analysis and Taqman miRNA assays we conclude that members of the miR-146 family, which is highly conserved between fish and human, are induced by bacterial infection in zebrafish in a MyD88 and Traf6 dependent manner. The combined knockdown of miR-146a and miR-146b in zebrafish embryos infected with S. typhimurium had no major effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and transcription factors known to be downstream of the MyD88-Traf6 pathway. In contrast, apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transport emerged as an infection-inducible pathway under miR-146 knockdown conditions, suggesting a possible function of miR-146 in regulating lipid metabolism during inflammation.	2013-10-10	2024-03-06 19:49:24	2024-03-06T19:49:24Z		696			14		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24112639 PMCID: PMC3852110					Animals; Apolipoproteins; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Leukocytes; MicroRNAs; Mycobacterium; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Salmonella Infections, Animal; Salmonella typhimurium; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Molecular mechanisms of toxicity of silver nanoparticles in zebrafish embryos	Environmental Science & Technology		1520-5851	10.1021/es401758d		Silver nanoparticles cause toxicity in exposed organisms and are an environmental health concern. The mechanisms of silver nanoparticle toxicity, however, remain unclear. We examined the effects of exposure to silver in nano-, bulk-, and ionic forms on zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) using a Next Generation Sequencing approach in an Illumina platform (High-Throughput SuperSAGE). Significant alterations in gene expression were found for all treatments and many of the gene pathways affected, most notably those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis, overlapped strongly between the three treatments indicating similar mechanisms of toxicity for the three forms of silver studied. Changes in oxidative phosphorylation indicated a down-regulation of this pathway at 24 h of exposure, but with a recovery at 48 h. This finding was consistent with a dose-dependent decrease in oxygen consumption at 24 h, but not at 48 h, following exposure to silver ions. Overall, our data provide support for the hypothesis that the toxicity caused by silver nanoparticles is principally associated with bioavailable silver ions in exposed zebrafish embryos. These findings are important in the evaluation of the risk that silver particles may pose to exposed vertebrate organisms.	2013-07-16	2024-03-06 19:49:23	2024-03-06T19:49:23Z		8005-8014		14	47		Environ Sci Technol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23758687 PMCID: PMC3854648					Animals; Metal Nanoparticles; Silver; Zebrafish

Gene expression analysis of zebrafish melanocytes, iridophores, and retinal pigmented epithelium reveals indicators of biological function and developmental origin	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0067801		In order to facilitate understanding of pigment cell biology, we developed a method to concomitantly purify melanocytes, iridophores, and retinal pigmented epithelium from zebrafish, and analyzed their transcriptomes. Comparing expression data from these cell types and whole embryos allowed us to reveal gene expression co-enrichment in melanocytes and retinal pigmented epithelium, as well as in melanocytes and iridophores. We found 214 genes co-enriched in melanocytes and retinal pigmented epithelium, indicating the shared functions of melanin-producing cells. We found 62 genes significantly co-enriched in melanocytes and iridophores, illustrative of their shared developmental origins from the neural crest. This is also the first analysis of the iridophore transcriptome. Gene expression analysis for iridophores revealed extensive enrichment of specific enzymes to coordinate production of their guanine-based reflective pigment. We speculate the coordinated upregulation of specific enzymes from several metabolic pathways recycles the rate-limiting substrate for purine synthesis, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, thus constituting a guanine cycle. The purification procedure and expression analysis described here, along with the accompanying transcriptome-wide expression data, provide the first mRNA sequencing data for multiple purified zebrafish pigment cell types, and will be a useful resource for further studies of pigment cell biology.	2013	2024-03-06 19:49:23	2024-03-06T19:49:23Z		e67801		7	8		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23874447 PMCID: PMC3706446					Animals; Biosynthetic Pathways; Cell Differentiation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Guanine; Melanocytes; Organ Specificity; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
TBITVNEY	journalArticle	2013	Rosenfeld, Gabriel E.; Mercer, Emily J.; Mason, Christopher E.; Evans, Todd	Small heat shock proteins Hspb7 and Hspb12 regulate early steps of cardiac morphogenesis	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.06.025		Cardiac morphogenesis is a complex multi-stage process, and the molecular basis for controlling distinct steps remains poorly understood. Because gata4 encodes a key transcriptional regulator of morphogenesis, we profiled transcript changes in cardiomyocytes when Gata4 protein is depleted from developing zebrafish embryos. We discovered that gata4 regulates expression of two small heat shock genes, hspb7 and hspb12, both of which are expressed in the embryonic heart. We show that depletion of Hspb7 or Hspb12 disrupts normal cardiac morphogenesis, at least in part due to defects in ventricular size and shape. We confirmed that gata4 interacts genetically with the hspb7/12 pathway, but surprisingly, we found that hspb7 also has an earlier, gata4-independent function. Depletion perturbs Kupffer's vesicle (KV) morphology leading to a failure in establishing the left-right axis of asymmetry. Targeted depletion of Hspb7 in the yolk syncytial layer is sufficient to disrupt KV morphology and also causes an even earlier block to heart tube formation and a bifid phenotype. Recently, several genome-wide association studies found that HSPB7 SNPs are highly associated with idiopathic cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Therefore, GATA4 and HSPB7 may act alone or together to regulate morphogenesis with relevance to congenital and acquired human heart disease.	2013-09-15	2024-03-06 19:49:23	2024-03-06T19:49:23Z		389-400		2	381		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23850773 PMCID: PMC3777613					Animals; Body Patterning; Cardiogenesis; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; GATA Transcription Factors; Gata4; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart Ventricles; Heart development; Heat-Shock Proteins, Small; Kupffer Cells; Kupffer's vesicle; Morphogenesis; Morpholinos; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organ Size; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Transcriptional Activation; YSL; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
A2QTZD57	journalArticle	2013	Yao, Zizhen; Farr, Gist H.; Tapscott, Stephen J.; Maves, Lisa	Pbx and Prdm1a transcription factors differentially regulate subsets of the fast skeletal muscle program in zebrafish	Biology Open		2046-6390	10.1242/bio.20133921		The basic helix-loop-helix factor Myod initiates skeletal muscle differentiation by directly and sequentially activating sets of muscle differentiation genes, including those encoding muscle contractile proteins. We hypothesize that Pbx homeodomain proteins direct Myod to a subset of its transcriptional targets, in particular fast-twitch muscle differentiation genes, thereby regulating the competence of muscle precursor cells to differentiate. We have previously shown that Pbx proteins bind with Myod on the promoter of the zebrafish fast muscle gene mylpfa and that Pbx proteins are required for Myod to activate mylpfa expression and the fast-twitch muscle-specific differentiation program in zebrafish embryos. Here we have investigated the interactions of Pbx with another muscle fiber-type regulator, Prdm1a, a SET-domain DNA-binding factor that directly represses mylpfa expression and fast muscle differentiation. The prdm1a mutant phenotype, early and increased fast muscle differentiation, is the opposite of the Pbx-null phenotype, delayed and reduced fast muscle differentiation. To determine whether Pbx and Prdm1a have opposing activities on a common set of genes, we used RNA-seq analysis to globally assess gene expression in zebrafish embryos with single- and double-losses-of-function for Pbx and Prdm1a. We find that the levels of expression of certain fast muscle genes are increased or approximately wild type in pbx2/4-MO;prdm1a-/- embryos, suggesting that Pbx activity normally counters the repressive action of Prdm1a for a subset of the fast muscle program. However, other fast muscle genes require Pbx but are not regulated by Prdm1a. Thus, our findings reveal that subsets of the fast muscle program are differentially regulated by Pbx and Prdm1a. Our findings provide an example of how Pbx homeodomain proteins act in a balance with other transcription factors to regulate subsets of a cellular differentiation program.	2013-06-15	2024-03-06 19:49:23	2024-03-06T19:49:23Z		546-555		6	2		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23789105 PMCID: PMC3683157					Fiber-type differentiation; Pbx; Prdm1; Skeletal muscle; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
K5TJS3VM	journalArticle	2013	Choudhuri, Avik; Maitra, Umadas; Evans, Todd	Translation initiation factor eIF3h targets specific transcripts to polysomes during embryogenesis	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1302934110		Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) plays a central role in translation initiation and consists of five core (conserved) subunits present in both budding yeast and higher eukaryotes. Higher eukaryotic eIF3 contains additional (noncore or nonconserved) subunits of poorly defined function, including sub-unit h (eIF3h), which in zebrafish is encoded by two distinct genes (eif3ha and eif3hb). Previously we showed that eif3ha encodes the predominant isoform during zebrafish embryogenesis and that depletion of this factor causes defects in the development of the brain and eyes. To investigate the molecular mechanism governing this regulation, we developed a genome-wide polysome-profiling strategy using stage-matched WT and eif3ha morphant zebrafish embryos. This strategy identified a large set of predominantly neural-associated translationally regulated mRNAs. A striking finding was a cohort of lens-associated crystallin isoform mRNAs lost from the eif3ha morphant polysomes, revealing a mechanism by which lens development is translationally controlled. We show that both UTR sequences of a targeted crystallin transcript are necessary but not sufficient for translational regulation by eif3ha. Therefore, our study reveals the role of a noncore eIF3 subunit in modulating a specific developmental program by regulating translation of defined transcripts and highlights the potential of the zebrafish system to identify translational regulatory mechanisms controlling vertebrate development.	2013-06-11	2024-03-06 19:49:22	2024-03-06T19:49:22Z		9818-9823		24	110		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23716667 PMCID: PMC3683746					Animals; Blotting, Western; Crygm2d; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Polyribosomes; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Subunits; RNA sequencing; RNA, Messenger; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; gamma-Crystallins

It has been controversial, however, as to what fraction of these RNAs is truly non-coding. Here, we combine ribosome profiling with a machine-learning approach to validate lncRNAs during zebrafish development in a high throughput manner. We find that dozens of proposed lncRNAs are protein-coding contaminants and that many lncRNAs have ribosome profiles that resemble the 5' leaders of coding RNAs. Analysis of ribosome profiling data from embryonic stem cells reveals similar properties for mammalian lncRNAs. These results clarify the annotation of developmental lncRNAs and suggest a potential role for translation in lncRNA regulation. In addition, our computational pipeline and ribosome profiling data provide a powerful resource for the identification of translated open reading frames during zebrafish development.	2013-07	2024-03-06 19:49:22	2024-03-06T19:49:22Z		2828-2834		13	140		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23698349 PMCID: PMC3678345					Animals; ES cells; Embryogenesis; Embryonic Development; Long non-coding RNAs; RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; Ribosome profiling; Ribosomes; Zebrafish

A substantial proportion of the protein repertoire of each organism consists of transcriptional regulators (TRs). It is believed that the differential expression and combinatorial action of these TRs is essential for vertebrate development and body homeostasis. We mined the zebrafish genome exhaustively for genes encoding TRs and determined their expression in the zebrafish embryo by sequencing to saturation and in situ hybridisation. At the evolutionary conserved phylotypic stage, 75% of the 3302 TR genes encoded in the genome are already expressed. The number of expressed TR genes increases only marginally in subsequent stages and is maintained during adulthood suggesting important roles of the TR genes in body homeostasis. Fewer than half of the TR genes (45%, n=1711 genes) are expressed in a tissue-restricted manner in the embryo. Transcripts of 207 genes were detected in a single tissue in the 24h embryo, potentially acting as regulators of specific processes. Other TR genes were expressed in multiple tissues. However, with the exception of certain territories in the nervous system, we did not find significant synexpression suggesting that most tissue-restricted TRs act in a freely combinatorial fashion. Our data indicate that elaboration of body pattern and function from the phylotypic stage onward relies mostly on redeployment of TRs and post-transcriptional processes.	2013-08-15	2024-03-06 19:49:22	2024-03-06T19:49:22Z		351-362		2	380		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23684812 PMCID: PMC4351915					Animals; Atlas of gene expression; Basal transcription; Body Patterning; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Library; Genes, Regulator; Genome; Phylotypic stage; RNAseq; Transcription; Transcription factor; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Reprogramming the maternal zebrafish genome after fertilization to match the paternal methylation pattern	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.030		Early vertebrate embryos must achieve totipotency and prepare for zygotic genome activation (ZGA). To understand this process, we determined the DNA methylation (DNAme) profiles of zebrafish gametes, embryos at different stages, and somatic muscle and compared them to gene activity and histone modifications. Sperm chromatin patterns are virtually identical to those at ZGA. Unexpectedly, the DNA of many oocyte genes important for germline functions (i.e., piwil1) or early development (i.e., hox genes) is methylated, but the loci are demethylated during zygotic cleavage stages to precisely the state observed in sperm, even in parthenogenetic embryos lacking a replicating paternal genome. Furthermore, this cohort constitutes the genes and loci that acquire DNAme during development (i.e., ZGA to muscle). Finally, DNA methyltransferase inhibition experiments suggest that DNAme silences particular gene and chromatin cohorts at ZGA, preventing their precocious expression. Thus, zebrafish achieve a totipotent chromatin state at ZGA through paternal genome competency and maternal genome DNAme reprogramming.	2013-05-09	2024-03-06 19:49:21	2024-03-06T19:49:21Z		759-772		4	153		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23663776 PMCID: PMC4030421					Animals; DNA Methylation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Fertilization; Male; Oocytes; Spermatozoa; Transcription Initiation Site; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Targeting oncogene expression to endothelial cells induces proliferation of the myelo-erythroid lineage by repressing the Notch pathway	Leukemia		1476-5551	10.1038/leu.2013.132		Human oncogenes involved in the development of hematological malignancies have been widely used to model experimental leukemia. However, models of myeloid leukemia rarely reproduce the human disease in full, due to genetic complexity or to difficulties in targeting leukemia initiating cells. Here, we used a zebrafish genetic model to induce the expression of oncogenic RAS in endothelial cells, including the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta that generates hematopoietic cells, and observed the development of a myelo-erythroid proliferative disorder. In larvae, the phenotype is characterized by disruption of the vascular system and prominent expansion of the caudal hematopoietic tissue. In few surviving juveniles, increased number of immature hematopoietic cells and arrest of myeloid maturation was found in kidney marrow. Peripheral blood showed increased erythroblasts and myeloid progenitors. We found that the abnormal phenotype is associated with a downregulation of the Notch pathway, whereas overexpressing an activated form of Notch together with the oncogene prevents the expansion of the myelo-erythroid compartment. This study identifies the downregulation of the Notch pathway following an oncogenic event in the hemogenic endothelium as an important step in the pathogenesis of myelo-erythroid disorders and describes a number of potential effectors of this transformation.	2013-11	2024-03-06 19:49:21	2024-03-06T19:49:21Z		2229-2241		11	27		Leukemia								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23625115					Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Endothelium, Vascular; Erythroid Precursor Cells; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Myeloid Cells; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); RNA, Messenger; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptor, Notch1; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Zebrafish; ras Proteins

However, our knowledge of how offspring inherit the DNA methylome from parents is limited. We generated nine single-base resolution DNA methylomes, including zebrafish gametes and early embryos. The oocyte methylome is significantly hypomethylated compared to sperm. Strikingly, the paternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained throughout early embryogenesis. The maternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained until the 16-cell stage. Then, the oocyte methylome is gradually discarded through cell division and is progressively reprogrammed to a pattern similar to that of the sperm methylome. The passive demethylation rate and the de novo methylation rate are similar in the maternal DNA. By the midblastula stage, the embryo's methylome is virtually identical to the sperm methylome. Moreover, inheritance of the sperm methylome facilitates the epigenetic regulation of embryogenesis. Therefore, besides DNA sequences, sperm DNA methylome is also inherited in zebrafish early embryos.	2013-05-09	2024-03-06 19:49:21	2024-03-06T19:49:21Z		773-784		4	153		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23663777 PMCID: PMC4081501					5-Methylcytosine; Animals; DNA Methylation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Germ Cells; Male; Oocytes; Spermatozoa; Zebrafish

The germline-specific PIWI pathway guards the genome against TEs, deriving its specificity from sequence complementarity between PIWI-bound small RNAs (piRNAs) and the TEs. The piRNAs are derived from so-called piRNA clusters. Recent studies have demonstrated that the piRNA repertoire can be adjusted to accommodate recent TE invasions by capturing invading TEs in piRNA loci. Thus far, no information concerning piRNA divergence is available from vertebrates. We present piRNA analyses of two relatively divergent zebrafish strains. We find that significant differences in the piRNA populations have accumulated, most notably among active class I TEs. This divergence can be split into differences in piRNA abundance per element and differences in sense/antisense polarity ratios. In crosses between animals of the different strains, many of these differences are resolved in the progeny. However, some differences remain, often leaning to the maternally contributed piRNA population. These differences can be detected at least two generations later. Our data illustrate, for the first time, the fluidity of piRNA populations in vertebrates and how the established diversity is transmitted to future generations.	2013-03	2024-03-06 19:49:21	2024-03-06T19:49:21Z		345-356		3	19		RNA								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23335638 PMCID: PMC3677245					Animals; Crosses, Genetic; DNA Transposable Elements; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Male; RNA, Small Interfering; Zebrafish; Zygote

RNA-seq-based mapping and candidate identification of mutations from forward genetic screens	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.147322.112		Forward genetic screens have elucidated molecular pathways required for innumerable aspects of life; however, identifying the causal mutations from such screens has long been the bottleneck in the process, particularly in vertebrates. We have developed an RNA-seq-based approach that identifies both the region of the genome linked to a mutation and candidate lesions that may be causal for the phenotype of interest. We show that our method successfully identifies zebrafish mutations that cause nonsense or missense changes to codons, alter transcript splicing, or alter gene expression levels. Furthermore, we develop an easily accessible bioinformatics pipeline allowing for implementation of all steps of the method. Overall, we show that RNA-seq is a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method to map and identify mutations that will greatly facilitate the power of forward genetics in vertebrate models.	2013-04	2024-03-06 19:49:20	2024-03-06T19:49:20Z		679-686		4	23		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23299976 PMCID: PMC3613584					Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Testing; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Internet; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA Splicing; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

The zebrafish has been increasingly used to model human diseases and it is particularly valuable in helping to identify common and conserved molecular mechanisms in vertebrates. Here we generated a liver tumor model in transgenic zebrafish by liver-specific expression of mouse Myc using a Tet-On system. Dosage-dependent induction of Myc expression specifically in the liver was observed in our Myc transgenic zebrafish, TO(Myc), and the elevated Myc expression caused liver hyperplasia, which progressed to hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma with prolonged induction. Next generation sequencing-based transcriptomic analyses indicated that ribosome proteins were overwhelmingly upregulated in the Myc-induced liver tumors. Cross-species analyses showed that the zebrafish Myc model correlated well with Myc transgenic mouse models for liver cancers. The Myc-induced zebrafish liver tumors also possessed molecular signatures highly similar to human those of hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, we found that a small Myc target gene set of 16 genes could be used to identify liver tumors due to Myc upregulation. Thus, our zebrafish model demonstrated the conserved role of Myc in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis in all vertebrate species.	2013-03	2024-03-06 19:49:20	2024-03-06T19:49:20Z		414-423		2	6		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23038063 PMCID: PMC3597023					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Mammals; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplasm Staging; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Tetracycline; Zebrafish

Id2a functions to limit Notch pathway activity and thereby influence the transition from proliferation to differentiation of retinoblasts during zebrafish retinogenesis	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.08.032		During vertebrate retinogenesis, the precise balance between retinoblast proliferation and differentiation is spatially and temporally regulated through a number of intrinsic factors and extrinsic signaling pathways. Moreover, there are complex gene regulatory network interactions between these intrinsic factors and extrinsic pathways, which ultimately function to determine when retinoblasts exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate. We recently uncovered a cell non-autonomous role for the intrinsic HLH factor, Id2a, in regulating retinoblast proliferation and differentiation, with Id2a-deficient retinae containing an abundance of proliferative retinoblasts and an absence of terminally differentiated retinal neurons and glia. Here, we report that Id2a function is necessary and sufficient to limit Notch pathway activity during retinogenesis. Id2a-deficient retinae possess elevated levels of Notch pathway component gene expression, while retinae overexpressing id2a possess reduced expression of Notch pathway component genes. Attenuation of Notch signaling activity by DAPT or by morpholino knockdown of Notch1a is sufficient to rescue both the proliferative and differentiation defects in Id2a-deficient retinae. In addition to regulating Notch pathway activity, through a novel RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analysis of Id2a-deficient retinae, we identify a number of additional intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory pathway components whose expression is regulated by Id2a. These data highlight the integral role played by Id2a in the gene regulatory network governing the transition from retinoblast proliferation to terminal differentiation during vertebrate retinogenesis.	2012-11-15	2024-03-06 19:49:20	2024-03-06T19:49:20Z		280-292		2	371		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22981606 PMCID: PMC3477674					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Homeodomain Proteins; Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Receptor, Notch1; Retina; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Effects of short-term exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on microRNA expression in zebrafish embryos	Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology		1096-0333	10.1016/j.taap.2012.08.007		Although many drugs and environmental chemicals are teratogenic, the mechanisms by which most toxicants disrupt embryonic development are not well understood. MicroRNAs, single-stranded RNA molecules of ~22 nt that regulate protein expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and promoting mRNA sequestration or degradation, are important regulators of a variety of cellular processes including embryonic development and cellular differentiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that exposure to xenobiotics can alter microRNA expression and contribute to the mechanisms by which environmental chemicals disrupt embryonic development. In this study we tested the hypothesis that developmental exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a well-known teratogen, alters microRNA expression during zebrafish development. We exposed zebrafish embryos to DMSO (0.1%) or TCDD (5nM) for 1h at 30hours post fertilization (hpf) and measured microRNA expression using several methods at 36 and 60hpf. TCDD caused strong induction of CYP1A at 36hpf (62-fold) and 60hpf (135-fold) as determined by real-time RT-PCR, verifying the effectiveness of the exposure. MicroRNA expression profiles were determined using microarrays (Agilent and Exiqon), next-generation sequencing (SOLiD), and real-time RT-PCR. The two microarray platforms yielded results that were similar but not identical; both showed significant changes in expression of miR-451, 23a, 23b, 24 and 27e at 60hpf. Multiple analyses were performed on the SOLiD sequences yielding a total of 16 microRNAs as differentially expressed by TCDD in zebrafish embryos. However, miR-27e was the only microRNA to be identified as differentially expressed by all three methods (both microarrays, SOLiD sequencing, and real-time RT-PCR). These results suggest that TCDD exposure causes modest changes in expression of microRNAs, including some (miR-451, 23a, 23b, 24 and 27e) that are critical for hematopoiesis and cardiovascular development.	2012-10-15	2024-03-06 19:49:19	2024-03-06T19:49:19Z		262-273		2	264		Toxicol Appl Pharmacol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22921993 PMCID: PMC3471217					Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; DNA, Complementary; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Environmental Pollutants; Genome; Genomics; MicroRNAs; Microarray Analysis; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Extensive alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.139733.112		The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish. mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into the identities, formation, and evolution of zebrafish 3' UTRs provide a resource for studying gene regulation during vertebrate development.	2012-10	2024-03-06 19:49:19	2024-03-06T19:49:19Z		2054-2066		10	22		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22722342 PMCID: PMC3460199					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genomics; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Organogenesis; Ovary; Poly A; Polyadenylation; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Ribosome profiling shows that miR-430 reduces translation before causing mRNA decay in zebrafish	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.1215704		MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through deadenylation, repression, and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. However, the contribution of each mechanism in non-steady-state situations remains unclear. We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild-type and dicer mutant zebrafish embryos and found that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation with use of an internal polyadenylate tail did not block target repression. Lastly, we observed that ribosome density along the length of the message remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the rate of initiation rather than affecting elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off. These results show that miR-430 regulates translation initiation before inducing mRNA decay during zebrafish development.	2012-04-13	2024-03-06 19:49:19	2024-03-06T19:49:19Z		233-237		6078	336		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22422859 PMCID: PMC3547538					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; MicroRNAs; Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational; Poly A; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Ribonuclease III; Ribosomes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcriptome-wide analysis of small RNA expression in early zebrafish development	RNA (New York, N.Y.)		1469-9001	10.1261/rna.029090.111		During early vertebrate development, a large number of noncoding RNAs are maternally inherited or expressed upon activation of zygotic transcription. The exact identity, expression levels, and function for most of these noncoding RNAs remain largely unknown. miRNAs (microRNAs) and piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs) are two classes of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in gene regulation during early embryonic development. Here, we utilized next-generation sequencing technology to determine temporal expression patterns for both miRNAs and piRNAs during four distinct stages of early vertebrate development using zebrafish as a model system. For miRNAs, the expression patterns for 198 known miRNAs within 122 different miRNA families and eight novel miRNAs were determined. Significant sequence variation was observed at the 5' and 3'ends of miRNAs, with most extra nucleotides added at the 3' end in a nontemplate directed manner. For the miR-430 family, the addition of adenosine and uracil residues is developmentally regulated and may play a role in miRNA stability during the maternal zygotic transition. Similar modification at the 3' ends of a large number of miRNAs suggests widespread regulation of stability during early development. Beside miRNAs, we also identified a large and unexpectedly diverse set of piRNAs expressed during early development.	2012-05	2024-03-06 19:49:19	2024-03-06T19:49:19Z		915-929		5	18		RNA								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22408181 PMCID: PMC3334700					Animals; Base Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; MicroRNAs; Polymorphism, Genetic; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA, Transfer; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Although this process is governed by regulatory interactions between the vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and Notch signaling pathways, little is known about the potential role of microRNAs. Through deep sequencing and functional screening in zebrafish, we find that miR-221 is essential for angiogenesis. miR-221 knockdown phenocopied defects associated with loss of the tip cell-expressed Flt4 receptor. Furthermore, miR-221 was required for tip cell proliferation and migration, as well as tip cell potential in mosaic blood vessels. miR-221 knockdown also prevented "hyper-angiogenesis" defects associated with Notch deficiency and miR-221 expression was inhibited by Notch signaling. Finally, miR-221 promoted tip cell behavior through repression of two targets: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1b (cdkn1b) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (pik3r1). These results identify miR-221 as an important regulatory node through which tip cell migration and proliferation are controlled during angiogenesis.	2012-02-14	2024-03-06 19:49:19	2024-03-06T19:49:19Z		418-429		2	22		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22340502 PMCID: PMC3285411					Animals; Biomarkers; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelium, Vascular; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; MicroRNAs; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Tdrd1 acts as a molecular scaffold for Piwi proteins and piRNA targets in zebrafish	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.1038/emboj.2011.228		Piwi proteins function in an RNAi-like pathway that silences transposons. Piwi-associated RNAs, also known as piRNAs, act as a guide to identify Piwi targets. The tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd1 has been linked to this pathway but its function has thus far remained unclear. We show that zebrafish Tdrd1 is required for efficient Piwi-pathway activity and proper nuage formation. Furthermore, we find that Tdrd1 binds both zebrafish Piwi proteins, Ziwi and Zili, and reveals sequence specificity in the interaction between Tdrd1 tudor domains and symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMAs) in Zili. Finally, we show that Tdrd1 complexes contain piRNAs and RNA molecules that are longer than piRNAs. We name these longer transcripts Tdrd1-associated transcripts (TATs). TATs likely represent cleaved Piwi pathway targets and may serve as piRNA biogenesis intermediates. Altogether, our data suggest that Tdrd1 acts as a molecular scaffold for Piwi proteins, bound through specific tudor domain-sDMA interactions, piRNAs and piRNA targets.	2011-07-08	2024-03-06 19:49:18	2024-03-06T19:49:18Z		3298-3308		16	30		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 21743441 PMCID: PMC3160653					Animals; Arginine; DNA Transposable Elements; Female; Macromolecular Substances; Male; Molecular Chaperones; Oocytes; Ovary; Protein Interaction Mapping; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA-Binding Proteins; Subcellular Fractions; Testis; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Determinism and stochasticity during maturation of the zebrafish antibody repertoire	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1014277108		It is thought that the adaptive immune system of immature organisms follows a more deterministic program of antibody creation than is found in adults. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the diversifying antibody repertoire in zebrafish over five developmental time points. We found that the immune system begins in a highly stereotyped state with preferential use of a small number of V (variable) D (diverse) J (joining) gene segment combinations, but that this stereotypy decreases dramatically as the zebrafish mature, with many of the top VDJ combinations observed in 2-wk-old zebrafish virtually disappearing by 1 mo. However, we discovered that, in the primary repertoire, there are strong correlations in VDJ use that increase with zebrafish maturity, suggesting that VDJ recombination involves a level of deterministic programming that is unexpected. This stereotypy is masked by the complex diversification processes of antibody maturation; the variation and lack of correlation in full repertoires between individuals appears to be derived from randomness in clonal expansion during the affinity maturation process. These data provide a window into the mechanisms of VDJ recombination and diversity creation and allow us to better understand how the adaptive immune system achieves diversity.	2011-03-29	2024-03-06 19:49:18	2024-03-06T19:49:18Z		5348-5353		13	108		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 21393572 PMCID: PMC3069157					Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Antibodies; Antibody Diversity; Immunoglobulin Subunits; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Stochastic Processes; VDJ Exons; Zebrafish

Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.055		Thousands of long intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals. To better understand the evolution and functions of these enigmatic RNAs, we used chromatin marks, poly(A)-site mapping and RNA-Seq data to identify more than 550 distinct lincRNAs in zebrafish. Although these shared many characteristics with mammalian lincRNAs, only 29 had detectable sequence similarity with putative mammalian orthologs, typically restricted to a single short region of high conservation. Other lincRNAs had conserved genomic locations without detectable sequence conservation. Antisense reagents targeting conserved regions of two zebrafish lincRNAs caused developmental defects. Reagents targeting splice sites caused the same defects and were rescued by adding either the mature lincRNA or its human or mouse ortholog. Our study provides a roadmap for identification and analysis of lincRNAs in model organisms and shows that lincRNAs play crucial biological roles during embryonic development with functionality conserved despite limited sequence conservation.	2011-12-23	2024-03-06 19:49:18	2024-03-06T19:49:18Z		1537-1550		7	147		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22196729 PMCID: PMC3376356					Animals; Embryonic Development; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Mice; RNA, Untranslated; Vertebrates; Zebrafish

Expanding the microRNA targeting code: functional sites with centered pairing	Molecular Cell		1097-4164	10.1016/j.molcel.2010.06.005		Most metazoan microRNA (miRNA) target sites have perfect pairing to the seed region, located near the miRNA 5' end. Although pairing to the 3' region sometimes supplements seed matches or compensates for mismatches, pairing to the central region has been known to function only at rare sites that impart Argonaute-catalyzed mRNA cleavage. Here, we present "centered sites," a class of miRNA target sites that lack both perfect seed pairing and 3'-compensatory pairing and instead have 11-12 contiguous Watson-Crick pairs to the center of the miRNA. Although centered sites can impart mRNA cleavage in vitro (in elevated Mg(2+)), in cells they repress protein output without consequential Argonaute-catalyzed cleavage. Our study also identified extensively paired sites that are cleavage substrates in cultured cells and human brain. This expanded repertoire of cleavage targets and the identification of the centered site type help explain why central regions of many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved.	2010-06-25	2024-03-06 19:49:17	2024-03-06T19:49:17Z		789-802		6	38		Mol Cell	Expanding the microRNA targeting code							eng					PubMed		PMID: 20620952 PMCID: PMC2942757					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Base Pairing; Base Sequence; Brain; Cations, Divalent; Conserved Sequence; Gene Expression Profiling; HeLa Cells; Humans; Magnesium; Mice; MicroRNAs; RNA, Double-Stranded; RNA, Messenger

Hen1 is required for oocyte development and piRNA stability in zebrafish	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.1038/emboj.2010.233		Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germ line-specific small RNA molecules that have a function in genome defence and germ cell development. They associate with a specific class of Argonaute proteins, named Piwi, and function through an RNA interference-like mechanism. piRNAs carry a 2'-O-methyl modification at their 3' end, which is added by the Hen1 enzyme. We show that zebrafish hen1 is specifically expressed in germ cells and is essential for maintaining a female germ line, whereas it is dispensable in the testis. Hen1 protein localizes to nuage through its C-terminal domain, but is not required for nuage formation. In hen1 mutant testes, piRNAs become uridylated and adenylated. Uridylation frequency is highest on retro-transposon-derived piRNAs and is accompanied by decreased piRNA levels and mild derepression of transposon transcripts. Altogether, our data suggest the existence of a uridylation-mediated 3'-5' exonuclease activity acting on piRNAs in zebrafish germ cells, which is counteracted by nuage-bound Hen1 protein. This system discriminates between piRNA targets and is required for ovary development and fully efficient transposon silencing.	2010-11-03	2024-03-06 19:49:17	2024-03-06T19:49:17Z		3688-3700		21	29		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 20859253 PMCID: PMC2982757					Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Immunoprecipitation; In Situ Hybridization; Male; Methyltransferases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oocytes; RNA 3' End Processing; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Interfering; Retroelements; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Subcellular Fractions; Testis; Uridine; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcriptome analysis of Traf6 function in the innate immune response of zebrafish embryos	Molecular Immunology		1872-9142	10.1016/j.molimm.2010.08.011		TRAF6 is a key player at the cross-roads of development and immunity. The analysis of its in vivo molecular function is a great challenge since severe developmental defects and early lethality caused by Traf6 deficiency in knock-out mice interfere with analyses of the immune response. In this study we have used a new strategy to analyze the function of Traf6 in a zebrafish-Salmonella infectious disease model. In our approach the effect of a Traf6 translation-blocking morpholino was titrated down to avoid developmental defects and the response to infection under these conditions was studied using the combination of microarray analysis and whole transcriptome deep sequencing. Transcriptome profiling of the traf6 knock-down allowed the identification of a gene set whose responsiveness during infection is highly dependent on Traf6. Expression trend analysis based on the resulting datasets identified nine clusters of genes with characteristic transcription response profiles, demonstrating Traf6 has a dynamic role as a positive and negative regulator. Among the Traf6-dependent genes was a large set of well known anti-microbial and inflammatory genes. Additionally, we identified several genes which were not previously linked to a response to microbial infection, such as the fertility hormone gene gnrh2 and the DNA-damage regulated autophagy modulator 1 gene dram1. With the use of the zebrafish embryo model we have now analyzed the in vivo function of Traf6 in the innate immune response without interference of adaptive immunity.	2010	2024-03-06 19:49:17	2024-03-06T19:49:17Z		179-190		1-3	48		Mol Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 20851470					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Immunity, Innate; In Situ Hybridization; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Deep sequencing of the innate immune transcriptomic response of zebrafish embryos to Salmonella infection	Fish & Shellfish Immunology		1095-9947	10.1016/j.fsi.2010.08.022		Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) bacteria cause an inflammatory and lethal infection in zebrafish embryos. To characterize the embryonic innate host response at the transcriptome level, we have extended and validated previous microarray data by Illumina next-generation sequencing analysis. We obtained 10 million sequence reads from control and Salmonella-infected zebrafish embryos using a tag-based sequencing method (DGE or Tag-Seq) and 15 million reads using whole transcript sequencing (RNA-Seq), which respectively mapped to circa 65% and 85% of 28,716 known Ensembl transcripts. Both sequencing methods showed a strong correlation of sequence read counts per transcript and an overlap of 241 transcripts differentially expressed in response to infection. A lower overlap of 165 transcripts was observed with previous microarray data. Based on the combined sequencing-based and microarray-based transcriptome data we compiled an annotated reference set of infection-responsive genes in zebrafish embryos, encoding transcription factors, signal transduction proteins, cytokines and chemokines, complement factors, proteins involved in apoptosis and proteolysis, proteins with anti-microbial activities, as well as many known or novel proteins not previously linked to the immune response. Furthermore, by comparison of the deep sequencing data of S. typhimurium infection in zebrafish embryos with previous deep sequencing data of Mycobacterium marinum infection in adult zebrafish we derived a common set of infection-responsive genes. This gene set consists of known and putative innate host defense genes that are expressed both in the absence and presence of a fully developed adaptive immune system and that provide a valuable reference for future studies of host-pathogen interactions using zebrafish infection models.	2011-11	2024-03-06 19:49:17	2024-03-06T19:49:17Z		716-724		5	31		Fish Shellfish Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 20816807					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fish Diseases; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Reproducibility of Results; Salmonella Infections, Animal; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

High-throughput sequencing of the zebrafish antibody repertoire	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.1170020		Despite tremendous progress in understanding the nature of the immune system, the full diversity of an organism's antibody repertoire is unknown. We used high-throughput sequencing of the variable domain of the antibody heavy chain from 14 zebrafish to analyze VDJ usage and antibody sequence. Zebrafish were found to use between 50 and 86% of all possible VDJ combinations and shared a similar frequency distribution, with some correlation of VDJ patterns between individuals. Zebrafish antibodies retained a few thousand unique heavy chains that also exhibited a shared frequency distribution. We found evidence of convergence, in which different individuals made the same antibody. This approach provides insight into the breadth of the expressed antibody repertoire and immunological diversity at the level of an individual organism.	2009-05-08	2024-03-06 19:49:16	2024-03-06T19:49:16Z		807-810		5928	324		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 19423829 PMCID: PMC3086368					Animals; Antibodies; Antibody Diversity; Base Sequence; Complementarity Determining Regions; Computational Biology; Female; Gene Library; Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain; Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains; Immunoglobulin Joining Region; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Recombination, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; VDJ Exons; Zebrafish

An atlas of neural crest lineages along the posterior developing zebrafish at single-cell resolution	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.60005		Neural crest cells (NCCs) are vertebrate stem cells that give rise to various cell types throughout the developing body in early life. Here, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic analyses to delineate NCC-derivatives along the posterior developing vertebrate, zebrafish, during the late embryonic to early larval stage, a period when NCCs are actively differentiating into distinct cellular lineages. We identified several major NCC/NCC-derived cell-types including mesenchyme, neural crest, neural, neuronal, glial, and pigment, from which we resolved over three dozen cellular subtypes. We dissected gene expression signatures of pigment progenitors delineating into chromatophore lineages, mesenchyme cells, and enteric NCCs transforming into enteric neurons. Global analysis of NCC derivatives revealed they were demarcated by combinatorial hox gene codes, with distinct profiles within neuronal cells. From these analyses, we present a comprehensive cell-type atlas that can be utilized as a valuable resource for further mechanistic and evolutionary investigations of NCC differentiation.	2021-02-16	2024-03-06 19:49:16	2024-03-06T19:49:16Z		e60005			10		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33591267 PMCID: PMC7886338					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Larva; Neural Crest; Zebrafish; developmental biology; enteric; melanocyte; neural crest; neural progenitor; sox10; transcriptome; zebrafish

A novel miRNA processing pathway independent of Dicer requires Argonaute2 catalytic activity	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.1190809		Dicer is a central enzyme in microRNA (miRNA) processing. We identified a Dicer-independent miRNA biogenesis pathway that uses Argonaute2 (Ago2) slicer catalytic activity. In contrast to other miRNAs, miR-451 levels were refractory to dicer loss of function but were reduced in MZago2 (maternal-zygotic) mutants. We found that pre-miR-451 processing requires Ago2 catalytic activity in vivo. MZago2 mutants showed delayed erythropoiesis that could be rescued by wild-type Ago2 or miR-451-duplex but not by catalytically dead Ago2. Changing the secondary structure of Dicer-dependent miRNAs to mimic that of pre-miR-451 restored miRNA function and rescued developmental defects in MZdicer mutants, indicating that the pre-miRNA secondary structure determines the processing pathway in vivo. We propose that Ago2-mediated cleavage of pre-miRNAs, followed by uridylation and trimming, generates functional miRNAs independently of Dicer.	2010-06-25	2024-03-06 19:49:16	2024-03-06T19:49:16Z		1694-1698		5986	328		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 20448148 PMCID: PMC3093307					Animals; Argonaute Proteins; Biocatalysis; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Erythropoiesis; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2; Humans; MicroRNAs; Models, Biological; Morphogenesis; Nucleic Acid Conformation; RNA Precursors; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; Recombinant Proteins; Ribonuclease III; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, we summarise transcriptome analyses of young adult (pre-disease) brains from a collection of 11 early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD)-like and non-EOFAD-like mutations in three zebrafish genes. The one cellular activity consistently predicted as affected by only the EOFAD-like mutations is oxidative phosphorylation, which produces most of the energy of the brain. All the mutations were predicted to affect protein synthesis. We extended our analysis to knock-in mouse models of APOE alleles and found the same effect for the late onset Alzheimer's disease risk allele ε4. Our results support a common molecular basis for the initiation of the pathological processes leading to both early and late onset forms of Alzheimer's disease, and illustrate the utility of zebrafish and knock-in single EOFAD mutation models for understanding the causes of this disease.	2022-01-01	2024-03-06 19:49:15	2024-03-06T19:49:15Z		dmm049187		1	15		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34842276 PMCID: PMC8807579					Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer's disease; Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Mice; Mouse; Oxidative phosphorylation; Presenilin-1; RNA-seq; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

However, the molecular mechanisms are mostly unknown, and a suitable animal model with internal increased ACR does not exist for in vivo studying so far. Several enzyme systems are responsible for acrolein detoxification, such as Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH), Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST). To evaluate the function of ACR in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, akr1a1a-/- zebrafish mutants are generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Accumulated endogenous acrolein is confirmed in akr1a1a-/- larvae and livers of adults. Moreover, a series of experiments are performed regarding organic alterations, the glucose homeostasis, transcriptome, and metabolomics in Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. Akr1a1a-/- larvae display impaired glucose homeostasis and angiogenic retina hyaloid vasculature, which are caused by reduced acrolein detoxification ability and increased internal ACR concentration. The effects of acrolein on hyaloid vasculature can be reversed by acrolein-scavenger l-carnosine treatment. In adult akr1a1a-/- mutants, impaired glucose tolerance accompanied by angiogenic retina vessels and glomerular basement membrane thickening, consistent with an early pathological appearance in diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, are observed. Thus, the data strongly suggest impaired ACR detoxification and elevated ACR concentration as biomarkers and inducers for diabetes and diabetic complications.	2021-09	2024-03-06 19:49:15	2024-03-06T19:49:15Z		e2101281		18	8		Adv Sci (Weinh)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34278746 PMCID: PMC8456208					Acrolein; Acrolein (ACR); Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Disease Models, Animal; Glucose; Homeostasis; Larva; Liver; Metabolomics; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; diabetes; impaired glucose homeostasis; organ complications; zebrafish

Spatial proteogenomics reveals distinct and evolutionarily conserved hepatic macrophage niches	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2021.12.018		The liver is the largest solid organ in the body, yet it remains incompletely characterized. Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis.	2022-01-20	2024-03-06 19:47:19	2024-03-06T19:47:19Z		379-396.e38		2	185		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35021063 PMCID: PMC8809252					Animals; Biological Evolution; CITE-seq; Cell Nucleus; Fatty Liver; Hepatocytes; Homeostasis; Humans; Kupffer Cells; Kupffer cell; Leukocyte Common Antigens; Lipids; Liver; Lymphocytes; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological; Myeloid Cells; NAFLD; Obesity; Proteogenomics; Proteome; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; across species; atlas; lipid-associated macrophage; liver; multi-omic; proteogenomic; spatial transcriptomics

The alx3 gene shapes the zebrafish neurocranium by regulating frontonasal neural crest cell differentiation timing	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.197483		During craniofacial development, different populations of cartilage- and bone-forming cells develop in precise locations in the head. Most of these cells are derived from pluripotent cranial neural crest cells and differentiate with distinct developmental timing and cellular morphologies. The mechanisms that divide neural crest cells into discrete populations are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to transcriptomically define different populations of cranial neural crest cells. We discovered that the gene family encoding the Alx transcription factors is enriched in the frontonasal population of neural crest cells. Genetic mutant analyses indicate that alx3 functions to regulate the distinct differentiation timing and cellular morphologies among frontonasal neural crest cell subpopulations. This study furthers our understanding of how genes controlling developmental timing shape craniofacial skeletal elements.	2021-04-01	2024-03-06 19:47:19	2024-03-06T19:47:19Z		dev197483		7	148		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33741714 PMCID: PMC8077506					Alx; Animals; Bone; Cartilage; Cell Differentiation; Craniofacial skeleton; Differentiation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Head; Homeodomain Proteins; Mice, Transgenic; Morphogenesis; Neural Crest; Neural crest cells; Neurocranium; Organogenesis; Skull; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; scRNA-seq

However, the specific cellular and molecular mechanism of caudal fin regeneration in zebrafish remains largely unclear. Therefore, we first confirmed the crucial period of fin regeneration in adult zebrafish by morphological and histological analysis. Then we performed RNA-Seq analysis of the caudal fin regeneration at three key stages, which provided some clues for exploring the mechanism of caudal fin regeneration. Moreover, we also determined the expressions of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-β, and the immune-related pathway JAK2α and STAT1b in the caudal fin of zebrafish following fin amputation by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Particularly, Hsp90α expression at mRNA and protein level determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively, and whole-mount in situ hybridization of Hsp90α were also performed in this study. The results showed that inflammatory cytokines were mainly expressed in the early period of caudal fin regeneration (1-3 days post amputation, dpa), indicating that fish immune system was involved in the fin regeneration. Furthermore, the high expression of Hsp90α in the vicinity of blastema and blood vessels of the regenerating fin suggests that Hsp90α may play a role in the initiation and promotion of caudal fin regeneration. Overall, our results provide a framework for further understanding the cellular and molecular mechanism in caudal fin regeneration.	2021-03	2024-03-06 19:47:18	2024-03-06T19:47:18Z		103922			116		Dev Comp Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33186559					Animal Fins; Animals; Caudal fin regeneration; Cytokine; Cytokines; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Hsp90α; Immune response; Inflammation; RNA, Messenger; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Two gain-of-function mechanisms are possible: repeat RNA toxicity and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) toxicity. We here dissected both possibilities using a zebrafish model for ALS. Expression of two DPRs, glycine-arginine and proline-arginine, induced a motor axonopathy. Similarly, expanded sense and antisense repeat RNA also induced a motor axonopathy and formed mainly cytoplasmic RNA foci. However, DPRs were not detected in these conditions. Moreover, stop codon-interrupted repeat RNA still induced a motor axonopathy and a synergistic role of low levels of DPRs was excluded. Altogether, these results show that repeat RNA toxicity is independent of DPR formation. This RNA toxicity, but not the DPR toxicity, was attenuated by the RNA-binding protein Pur-alpha and the autophagy-related protein p62. Our findings demonstrate that RNA toxicity, independent of DPR toxicity, can contribute to the pathogenesis of C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD.	2018-03	2024-03-06 19:47:18	2024-03-06T19:47:18Z		427-443		3	135		Acta Neuropathol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29302778					ALS; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Axons; C9orf72; C9orf72 Protein; DNA Repeat Expansion; DPR; Disease Models, Animal; Escherichia coli; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; Motor Neurons; Pur-alpha; RNA; RNA toxicity; Zebrafish; p62

Comparative Toxicotranscriptomics of Single Cell RNA-Seq and Conventional RNA-Seq in TCDD-Exposed Testicular Tissue	Frontiers in Toxicology		2673-3080	10.3389/ftox.2022.821116		In this report, we compare the outcomes and limitations of two methods of transcriptomic inquiry on adult zebrafish testes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) during sexual differentiation: conventional or bulk RNA-seq (bulk-seq) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scRNA-seq has emerged as a valuable tool for uncovering cell type-specific transcriptome dynamics which exist in heterogeneous tissue. Our lab previously showed the toxicological value of the scRNA-seq pipeline to characterize the sequelae of TCDD exposure in testes, demonstrating that loss of spermatids and spermatozoa, but not other cell types, contributed to the pathology of infertility in adult male zebrafish exposed during sexual differentiation. To investigate the potential for technical artifacts in scRNA-seq such as cell dissociation effects and reduced transcriptome coverage, we compared bulk-sequenced and scRNA-seq-paired samples from control and TCDD-exposed samples to understand what is gained and lost in scRNA-seq vs bulk-seq, both transcriptomically and toxicologically. We hypothesized that the testes may be sensitive to tissue disruption as they contain multiple cell types under constant division and/or maturation, and that TCDD exposure may mediate the extent of sensitivity. Thus, we sought to understand the extent to which this dissociation impacts the toxicological value of data returned from scRNA-seq. We confirm that the required dissociation of individual cells from intact tissue has a significant impact on gene expression, affecting gene pathways with the potential to confound toxicogenomics studies on exposures if findings are not well-controlled and well-situated in context. Additionally, a common scRNA-seq method using cDNA amplified from the 3' end of mRNA under-detects low-expressing transcripts including transcription factors. We confirm this, and show TCDD-related genes may be overlooked by scRNA-seq, however, this under-detection effect is not mediated by TCDD exposure. Even so, scRNA-seq generally extracted toxicologically relevant information better than the bulk-seq method in the present study. This report aims to inform future experimental design for transcriptomic investigation in the growing field of toxicogenomics by demonstrating the differential information extracted from sequencing cells-despite being from the same tissue and exposure scheme-is influenced by the specific protocol used, with implications for the interpretation of exposure-induced risk.	2022	2024-03-06 19:47:17	2024-03-06T19:47:17Z		821116			4		Front Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35615540 PMCID: PMC9126299					TCDD; bulk-seq; exposure; pseudo bulk-seq; scRNA-seq dropout; single cell RNA-seq; transcriptome

The development of ciliated cells, their impact on CSF flow, and their function in brain and axial morphogenesis are not fully understood. We have characterized motile ciliated cells within the zebrafish brain ventricles. We show that the ventricles undergo restructuring through development, involving a transition from mono- to multiciliated cells (MCCs) driven by gmnc. MCCs co-exist with monociliated cells and generate directional flow patterns. These ciliated cells have different developmental origins and are genetically heterogenous with respect to expression of the Foxj1 family of ciliary master regulators. Finally, we show that cilia loss from the tela choroida and choroid plexus or global perturbation of multiciliation does not affect overall brain or spine morphogenesis but results in enlarged ventricles. Our findings establish that motile ciliated cells are generated by complementary and sequential transcriptional programs to support ventricular development.	2021-10-05	2024-03-06 19:47:16	2024-03-06T19:47:16Z		109775		1	37		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34610312 PMCID: PMC8524669					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Cell Lineage; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Cilia; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Ependyma; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Editing; Morphogenesis; Nuclear Proteins; Spine; Telencephalon; Tubulin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; brain; cerebrospinal fluid; choroid plexus; cilia; ependymal cell; foxj1; gmnc; multiciliated cells; scoliosis; zebrafish

Here, by combining live imaging of triple transgenic zebrafish embryos and single-cell RNA sequencing we established a detailed cell atlas of the regenerating caudal fin in zebrafish larvae. We confirmed the presence of macrophage subsets that govern zebrafish fin regeneration, and identified a foxd3-positive cell population within the regenerating fin. Genetic depletion of these foxd3-positive neural crest-derived cells (NCdC) showed that they are involved in blastema formation and caudal fin regeneration. Finally, chemical inhibition and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that these foxd3-positive cells regulate macrophage recruitment and polarization through the NRG1/ErbB pathway. Here, we show the diversity of the cells required for blastema formation, identify a discrete foxd3-positive NCdC population, and reveal the critical function of the NRG1/ErbB pathway in controlling the dialogue between macrophages and NCdC.	2021-11-03	2024-03-06 19:47:16	2024-03-06T19:47:16Z		6336		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34732706 PMCID: PMC8566576					Animal Fins; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, erbB; Larva; Macrophages; Neural Crest; Neuregulin-1; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tübingen reference strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization.	2020-12	2024-03-06 19:47:15	2024-03-06T19:47:15Z		337-343		7837	588		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33239788 PMCID: PMC8183574					Animals; Brain; Conserved Sequence; DNA Methylation; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome; Heterochromatin; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Mice; Molecular Imaging; Organ Specificity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Single-Cell Analysis; Species Specificity; Zebrafish

Elizabeth	Tfap2b specifies an embryonic melanocyte stem cell that retains adult multifate potential	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110234		Melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells, are replenished from multiple stem cell niches in adult tissue. Although pigmentation traits are known risk factors for melanoma, we know little about melanocyte stem cell (McSC) populations other than hair follicle McSCs and lack key lineage markers with which to identify McSCs and study their function. Here we find that Tfap2b and a select set of target genes specify an McSC population at the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish. Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration. Fate mapping data reveal that tfap2b+ McSCs have multifate potential, and are the cells of origin for large patches of adult melanocytes, two other pigment cell types (iridophores and xanthophores), and nerve-associated cells. Hence, Tfap2b confers McSC identity in early development, distinguishing McSCs from other neural crest and pigment cell lineages, and retains multifate potential in the adult zebrafish.	2022-01-11	2024-03-06 19:47:14	2024-03-06T19:47:14Z		110234		2	38		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35021087 PMCID: PMC8764619					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; ErbB; Melanocytes; Pigmentation; Skin; Skin Pigmentation; Stem Cells; Transcription Factor AP-2; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; chemical genetics; fate mapping; melanocyte lineage; melanocyte stem cells; neural crest; scRNA-seq; tfap2b; zebrafish

Despite major progress in our understanding of the underlying processes, the transcriptomic changes are largely unknown. We carried out a computational analysis of the transcriptome of the regenerating telencephalon integrating changes in the expression of mRNAs, their splice variants and investigated the putative role of regulatory RNAs in the modulation of these transcriptional changes. Profound changes in the expression of genes and their splice variants engaged in many distinct processes were observed. Differential transcription and splicing are important processes in response to injury of the telencephalon. As exemplified by the coordinated regulation of the cholesterol synthesizing enzymes and transporters, the genome responded to injury of the telencephalon in a multi-tiered manner with distinct and interwoven changes in expression of enzymes, transporters and their regulatory molecules. This coordinated genomic response involved a decrease of the mRNA of the key transcription factor SREBF2, induction of microRNAs (miR-182, miR-155, miR-146, miR-31) targeting cholesterol genes, shifts in abundance of splice variants as well as regulation of long non-coding RNAs. Cholesterol metabolism appears to be switched from synthesis to relocation of cholesterol. Based on our in silico analyses, this switch involves complementary and synergistic inputs by different regulatory principles. Our studies suggest that adaptation of cholesterol metabolism is a key process involved in regeneration of the injured zebrafish brain.	2021	2024-03-06 19:47:14	2024-03-06T19:47:14Z		671249			15		Front Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34054419 PMCID: PMC8162057					bioinformatics analysis; cholesterol; regenerative neurogenesis; regulation of transcription; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
QCKK4UGP	journalArticle	2020	Lavergne, Arnaud; Tarifeño-Saldivia, Estefania; Pirson, Justine; Reuter, Anne-Sophie; Flasse, Lydie; Manfroid, Isabelle; Voz, Marianne L.; Peers, Bernard	Pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells in zebrafish share common transcriptomic signatures and regulatory programmes	BMC biology		1741-7007	10.1186/s12915-020-00840-1		BACKGROUND: Endocrine cells of the zebrafish digestive system play an important role in regulating metabolism and include pancreatic endocrine cells (PECs) clustered in the islets of Langerhans and the enteroendocrine cells (EECs) scattered in the intestinal epithelium. Despite EECs and PECs are being located in distinct organs, their differentiation involves shared molecular mechanisms and transcription factors. However, their degree of relatedness remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated comprehensively the similarity of EECs and PECs by defining their transcriptomic landscape and comparing the regulatory programmes controlled by Pax6b, a key player in both EEC and PEC differentiations. RESULTS: RNA sequencing was performed on EECs and PECs isolated from wild-type and pax6b mutant zebrafish. Data mining of wild-type zebrafish EEC data confirmed the expression of orthologues for most known mammalian EEC hormones, but also revealed the expression of three additional neuropeptide hormones (Proenkephalin-a, Calcitonin-a and Adcyap1a) not previously reported to be expressed by EECs in any species. Comparison of transcriptomes from EECs, PECs and other zebrafish tissues highlights a very close similarity between EECs and PECs, with more than 70% of genes being expressed in both endocrine cell types. Comparison of Pax6b-regulated genes in EECs and PECs revealed a significant overlap. pax6b loss-of-function does not affect the total number of EECs and PECs but instead disrupts the balance between endocrine cell subtypes, leading to an increase of ghrelin- and motilin-like-expressing cells in both the intestine and pancreas at the expense of other endocrine cells such as beta and delta cells in the pancreas and pyyb-expressing cells in the intestine. Finally, we show that the homeodomain of Pax6b is dispensable for its action in both EECs and PECs. CONCLUSION: We have analysed the transcriptomic landscape of wild-type and pax6b mutant zebrafish EECs and PECs. Our study highlights the close relatedness of EECs and PECs at the transcriptomic and regulatory levels, supporting the hypothesis of a common phylogenetic origin and underscoring the potential implication of EECs in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.	2020-08-31	2024-03-06 19:47:14	2024-03-06T19:47:14Z		109		1	18		BMC Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32867764 PMCID: PMC7457809					Animals; Endocrine Cells; Enteroendocrine; Gene Expression Regulation; Hormone; Intestines; PAX6 Transcription Factor; Pancreas; Pancreatic endocrine cells; Pax6; RNA-seq; Transcriptome; Transcriptome comparison; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
SR6BFAUI	journalArticle	2020	Barthelson, Karissa; Pederson, Stephen Martin; Newman, Morgan; Lardelli, Michael	Brain transcriptome analysis reveals subtle effects on mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis of mutations in the SORL1 gene implicated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease	Molecular Brain		1756-6606	10.1186/s13041-020-00681-7		To prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we must understand its molecular basis. The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed.	2020-10-19	2024-03-06 19:47:13	2024-03-06T19:47:13Z		142		1	13		Mol Brain								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33076949 PMCID: PMC7570131					Alleles; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Base Sequence; Brain; Breeding; Disease Models, Animal; Familial Alzheimer’s disease; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Harmonic mean p-value; Heterozygote; Homeostasis; Iron; Iron homeostasis; LDL-Receptor Related Proteins; Mitochondria; Mutation; Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay; RNA, Messenger; RNA-seq; SORL1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) encodes a multi-domain receptor protein genetically associated with both rare, early-onset familial AD (EOfAD) and common, sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD). SORL1 protein has been shown to act in the trafficking of the amyloid β A4 precursor protein (AβPP) that is proteolysed to form one of the pathological hallmarks of AD, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. However, other functions of SORL1 in AD are less well understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of heterozygosity for an EOfAD-like mutation in SORL1 on the brain transcriptome of young-adult mutation carriers using zebrafish as a model organism. METHODS: We performed targeted mutagenesis to generate an EOfAD-like mutation in the zebrafish orthologue of SORL1 and performed RNA-sequencing on mRNA isolated from the young adult brains of siblings in a family of fish either wild type (non-mutant) or heterozygous for the EOfAD-like mutation. RESULTS: We identified subtle differences in gene expression indicating changes in mitochondrial and ribosomal function in the mutant fish. These changes appear to be independent of changes in mitochondrial content or the expression of AβPP-related proteins in zebrafish. CONCLUSION: These findings provided evidence supporting that EOfAD mutations in SORL1 affect mitochondrial and ribosomal function and provide the basis for future investigation elucidating the nature of these effects.	2021	2024-03-06 19:47:13	2024-03-06T19:47:13Z		1105-1119		3	79		J Alzheimers Dis								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33386808					Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Animals; Blotting, Western; Brain; Gene Expression Profiling; LDL-Receptor Related Proteins; Mitochondria; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA-seq; Ribosomes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; mitochondria; ribosome; sorl1; zebrafish

One consistent observation for all PRESENILIN gene mutations causing EOfAD is that a transcript is produced with a reading frame terminated by the normal stop codon-the "reading frame preservation rule". Mutations that do not obey this rule do not cause the disease. The reasons for this are debated. OBJECTIVE: To predict cellular functions affected by heterozygosity for a frameshift, or a reading frame-preserving mutation in zebrafish psen2 using bioinformatic techniques. METHODS: A frameshift mutation (psen2 N140fs  ) and a reading frame-preserving (in-frame) mutation (psen2 T141 _ L142delinsMISLISV  ) were previously isolated during genome editing directed at the N140 codon of zebrafish psen2 (equivalent to N141 of human PSEN2). We mated a pair of fish heterozygous for each mutation to generate a family of siblings including wild type and heterozygous mutant genotypes. Transcriptomes from young adult (6 months) brains of these genotypes were analyzed. RESULTS: The in-frame mutation uniquely caused subtle, but statistically significant, changes to expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, long-term potentiation and the cell cycle. The frameshift mutation uniquely affected genes involved in Notch and MAPK signaling, extracellular matrix receptor interactions and focal adhesion. Both mutations affected ribosomal protein gene expression but in opposite directions. CONCLUSION: A frameshift and an in-frame mutation at the same position in zebrafish psen2 cause discrete effects. Changes in oxidative phosphorylation, long-term potentiation and the cell cycle may promote EOfAD pathogenesis in humans.	2021-05-04	2024-03-06 19:47:12	2024-03-06T19:47:12Z		395-404		1	5		J Alzheimers Dis Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34189411 PMCID: PMC8203281					Alzheimer’s disease; PSEN2; RNA-seq; mitochondria; zebrafish

To investigate the molecular programs potentially mediating neurodegeneration-induced NSPC plasticity in regenerating organisms, we generated an Amyloid-β42 (Aβ42)-dependent neurotoxic model in adult zebrafish brain through cerebroventricular microinjection of cell-penetrating Aβ42 derivatives. Aβ42 deposits in neurons and causes phenotypes reminiscent of amyloid pathophysiology: apoptosis, microglial activation, synaptic degeneration, and learning deficits. Aβ42 also induces NSPC proliferation and enhanced neurogenesis. Interleukin-4 (IL4) is activated primarily in neurons and microglia/macrophages in response to Aβ42 and is sufficient to increase NSPC proliferation and neurogenesis via STAT6 phosphorylation through the IL4 receptor in NSPCs. Our results reveal a crosstalk between neurons and immune cells mediated by IL4/STAT6 signaling, which induces NSPC plasticity in zebrafish brains.	2016-10-18	2024-03-06 19:47:12	2024-03-06T19:47:12Z		941-948		4	17		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27760324					Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid-β42; Animals; Brain; Cell Plasticity; Cell Proliferation; Interleukin-4; Microglia; Nerve Degeneration; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Peptide Fragments; Phenotype; Protein Aggregates; STAT6; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; inflammation; interlukin-4; neural stem cell; neuro-immune crosstalk; neurodegeneration; regeneration; zebrafish

EGF-mediated suppression of cell extrusion during mucosal damage attenuates opportunistic fungal invasion	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108896		Severe and often fatal opportunistic fungal infections arise frequently following mucosal damage caused by trauma or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Interaction of fungal pathogens with epithelial cells that comprise mucosae is a key early event associated with invasion, and, therefore, enhancing epithelial defense mechanisms may mitigate infection. Here, we establish a model of mold and yeast infection mediated by inducible epithelial cell loss in larval zebrafish. Epithelial cell loss by extrusion promotes exposure of laminin associated with increased fungal attachment, invasion, and larval lethality, whereas fungi defective in adherence or filamentation have reduced virulence. Transcriptional profiling identifies significant upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epigen (EPGN) upon mucosal damage. Treatment with recombinant human EPGN suppresses epithelial cell extrusion, leading to reduced fungal invasion and significantly enhanced survival. These data support the concept of augmenting epithelial restorative capacity to attenuate pathogenic invasion of fungi associated with human disease.	2021-03-23	2024-03-06 19:47:12	2024-03-06T19:47:12Z		108896		12	34		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33761358 PMCID: PMC8842569					Animals; EGF signaling; Epidermal Growth Factor; Epigen; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Hyphae; Larva; Models, Biological; Mucous Membrane; Neutrophils; Recombinant Proteins; Rhizopus; Spores, Fungal; Time Factors; Zebrafish; cell extrusion; epitheli; fungi; zebrafish

Thus, changes to the RNA content are solely dependent on RNA degradation. Although several mechanisms that promote RNA decay during embryogenesis have been identified, it remains unclear which machineries contribute to remodeling the maternal transcriptome. Here, we focused on the degradation factor Ski7 in zebrafish. Homozygous ski7 mutant fish had higher proportions of both poor quality eggs and eggs that were unable to develop beyond the one-cell stage. Consistent with the idea that Ski7 participates in remodeling the maternal RNA content, transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of misregulated mRNAs in the absence of Ski7. Furthermore, upregulated genes were generally lowly expressed in wild type, suggesting that Ski7 maintains low transcript levels for this subset of genes. Finally, GO enrichment and proteomic analyses of misregulated factors implicated Ski7 in the regulation of redox processes. This was confirmed experimentally by an increased resistance of ski7 mutant embryos to reductive stress. Our results provide first insights into the physiological role of vertebrate Ski7 as a post-transcriptional regulator during the oocyte-to-embryo transition.	2021-02	2024-03-06 19:47:11	2024-03-06T19:47:11Z		e1009390		2	17		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33600438 PMCID: PMC7924785					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Exosomes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mutation; Oocytes; Protein Binding; RNA; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial fertilization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific fertilization in fish. Bouncer's closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally fertilizing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.	2018-09-07	2024-03-06 19:47:11	2024-03-06T19:47:11Z		1029-1033		6406	361		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30190407 PMCID: PMC6195191					Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Female; Male; Mutation; Oocytes; Oryzias; Species Specificity; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Testis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Cardiac regeneration requires the coordination of cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation and migration. The TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway has been implicated in cardiac regeneration, but the molecular mechanisms by which this pathway regulates CM proliferation and migration have not been fully illustrated. Here, we investigated the function of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling in a zebrafish model of ventricular ablation. Multiple components of this pathway were upregulated/activated after injury. Utilizing a specific inhibitor of Smad3, we detected an increased ratio of unrecovered hearts. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway could affect CM proliferation and migration. Further analysis demonstrated that the CM cell cycle was disrupted and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like response was impaired, which limited cardiac regeneration. Altogether, our study reveals an important function of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling in CM cell cycle progression and EMT process during zebrafish ventricle regeneration.	2021	2024-03-06 19:47:11	2024-03-06T19:47:11Z		632372			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33816481 PMCID: PMC8010688					EMT-like response; Smad3; TGF-β; cell cycle; ventricle regeneration

Thyroid hormone regulates distinct paths to maturation in pigment cell lineages	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.45181		Thyroid hormone (TH) regulates diverse developmental events and can drive disparate cellular outcomes. In zebrafish, TH has opposite effects on neural crest derived pigment cells of the adult stripe pattern, limiting melanophore population expansion, yet increasing yellow/orange xanthophore numbers. To learn how TH elicits seemingly opposite responses in cells having a common embryological origin, we analyzed individual transcriptomes from thousands of neural crest-derived cells, reconstructed developmental trajectories, identified pigment cell-lineage specific responses to TH, and assessed roles for TH receptors. We show that TH promotes maturation of both cell types but in distinct ways. In melanophores, TH drives terminal differentiation, limiting final cell numbers. In xanthophores, TH promotes accumulation of orange carotenoids, making the cells visible. TH receptors act primarily to repress these programs when TH is limiting. Our findings show how a single endocrine factor integrates very different cellular activities during the generation of adult form.	2019-05-29	2024-03-06 19:47:10	2024-03-06T19:47:10Z		e45181			8		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31140974 PMCID: PMC6588384					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neural Crest; Pigments, Biological; Thyroid Hormones; Zebrafish; developmental biology; genetics; genomics; melanophore; neural crest; pigmentation; post-embryonic development; thyroid hormone; xanthophore; zebrafish

Previous studies have revealed numerous linear and planar regulatory mechanisms. However, a multi-dimensional transcriptomic atlas of any given hematopoietic organ has not yet been established. Here, we use multiple RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, including cell type-specific, temporal bulk RNA-seq, in vivo GEO-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), to characterize the detailed spatiotemporal transcriptome during hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of zebrafish. Combinatorial expression profiling reveals that, in the CHT niche, HSPCs and their neighboring supporting cells are co-regulated by shared signaling pathways and intrinsic factors, such as integrin signaling and Smchd1. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis unveils the strong association between cell cycle status and HSPC differentiation. Taken together, we report a global transcriptome landscape that provides valuable insights and a rich resource to understand HSPC expansion in an intact vertebrate hematopoietic organ.	2019-04-30	2024-03-06 19:47:10	2024-03-06T19:47:10Z		1567-1578.e5		5	27		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31042481					3D atlas; Animals; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; RNA-Seq; Signal Transduction; Single-Cell Analysis; Stem Cell Niche; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; multi-dimensional RNA-seq; signaling; zebrafish

Parental exposure to gamma radiation causes progressively altered transcriptomes linked to adverse effects in zebrafish offspring	Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex: 1987)		1873-6424	10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.023		Ionizing radiation causes a variety of effects, including DNA damage associated to cancers. However, the effects in progeny from irradiated parents is not well documented. Using zebrafish as a model, we previously found that parental exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with effects in offspring, such as increased hatching rates, deformities, increased DNA damage and reactive oxygen species. Here, we assessed short (one month) and long term effects (one year) on gene expression in embryonic offspring (5.5 h post fertilization) from zebrafish exposed during gametogenesis to gamma radiation (8.7 or 53 mGy/h for 27 days, total dose 5.2 or 31 Gy) using mRNA sequencing. One month after exposure, a global change in gene expression was observed in offspring from the 53 mGy/h group, followed by embryonic death at late gastrula, whereas offspring from the 8.7 mGy/h group was unaffected. Interestingly, one year after exposure newly derived embryos from the 8.7 mGy/h group exhibited 2390 (67.7% downregulated) differentially expressed genes. Overlaps in differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways were evident between the 53 mGy/h group one month and 8.7 mGy/h one year after exposure, but were oppositely regulated. Pathways could be linked to effects in adults and offspring, such as DNA damage (via Atm signaling) and reproduction (via Gnrh signaling). Comparison with gene expression analysis in directly exposed embryos indicate transferrin a and cytochrome P450 2x6 as possible biomarkers for radiation response in zebrafish. Our results indicate latent effects following ionizing radiation exposure from the lower dose in parents that can be transmitted to offspring and warrants monitoring effects over subsequent generations.	2018-03	2024-03-06 19:47:09	2024-03-06T19:47:09Z		855-863			234		Environ Pollut								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29248853					Animals; Biomarkers; DNA Damage; Female; Gamma Rays; Gene expression; Ionizing radiation; Male; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Radiation Exposure; Radiation, Ionizing; Radioecology; Reproduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; mRNA sequencing

Endocrine and local signaling interact to regulate spermatogenesis in zebrafish: follicle-stimulating hormone, retinoic acid and androgens	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.178665		Retinoic acid (RA) is crucial for mammalian spermatogonia differentiation, and stimulates Stra8 expression, a gene required for meiosis. Certain fish species, including zebrafish, have lost the stra8 gene. While RA still seems important for spermatogenesis in fish, it is not known which stage(s) respond to RA or whether its effects are integrated into the endocrine regulation of spermatogenesis. In zebrafish, RA promoted spermatogonia differentiation, supported androgen-stimulated meiosis, and reduced spermatocyte and spermatid apoptosis. Follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) stimulated RA production. Expressing a dominant-negative RA receptor variant in germ cells clearly disturbed spermatogenesis but meiosis and spermiogenesis still took place, although sperm quality was low in 6-month-old adults. This condition also activated Leydig cells. Three months later, spermatogenesis apparently had recovered, but doubling of testis weight demonstrated hypertrophy, apoptosis/DNA damage among spermatids was high and sperm quality remained low. We conclude that RA signaling is important for zebrafish spermatogenesis but is not of crucial relevance. As Fsh stimulates androgen and RA production, germ cell-mediated, RA-dependent reduction of Leydig cell activity may form a hitherto unknown intratesticular negative-feedback loop.	2019-11-04	2024-03-06 19:47:08	2024-03-06T19:47:08Z		dev178665		21	146		Development	Endocrine and local signaling interact to regulate spermatogenesis in zebrafish							eng					PubMed		PMID: 31597660					11-ketotestosterone; Androgens; Animals; Busulfan; Cell Differentiation; Endocrine System; Feedback, Physiological; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Male; Mice; RNA sequencing; Retinoic acid; Retinoids; Signal Transduction; Spermatids; Spermatocytes; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Testis; Transgenes; Tretinoin; Zebrafish

How this optimum of phenotypes is achieved during the development of vertebrates is unclear. Here, we carried out a multi-faceted and single-cell resolution screen of zebrafish embryonic blood vessels upon mutagenesis of single and multi-gene microRNA (miRNA) families. We found that embryos lacking particular miRNA-dependent signaling pathways develop a vascular trait similar to wild-type, but with a profound increase in phenotypic heterogeneity. Aberrant trait variance in miRNA mutant embryos uniquely sensitizes their vascular system to environmental perturbations. We discovered a previously unrecognized role for specific vertebrate miRNAs to protect tissue development against phenotypic variability. This discovery marks an important advance in our comprehension of how miRNAs function in the development of higher organisms.	2017-03-27	2024-03-06 19:47:08	2024-03-06T19:47:08Z		552-565.e5		6	40		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28350988 PMCID: PMC5404386					Animals; Arteries; Cell Count; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Homozygote; MicroRNAs; Morphogenesis; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Phenotype; Pseudopodia; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Stress, Physiological; Vertebrates; Zebrafish; cardiovascular development; endothelial cells; environmental stress; miR-139; miR-223; miR-24; phenotypic variability; robustness; target gene networks; zebrafish mutants

Thomas	Loss of atrx cooperates with p53-deficiency to promote the development of sarcomas and other malignancies	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1008039		The SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling protein ATRX is a tumor suppressor in sarcomas, gliomas and other malignancies. Its loss of function facilitates the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway in tumor cells, while it also affects Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing of its target genes. To further define the role of inactivating ATRX mutations in carcinogenesis, we knocked out atrx in our previously reported p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish line that develops malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas. Complete inactivation of atrx using CRISPR/Cas9 was lethal in developing fish and resulted in an alpha-thalassemia-like phenotype including reduced alpha-globin expression. In p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish neither peripheral nerve sheath tumors nor gliomas showed accelerated onset in atrx+/- fish, but these fish developed various tumors that were not observed in their atrx+/+ siblings, including epithelioid sarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and rare types of carcinoma. These cancer types are included in the AACR Genie database of human tumors associated with mutant ATRX, indicating that our zebrafish model reliably mimics a role for ATRX-loss in the early pathogenesis of these human cancer types. RNA-seq of p53/nf1- and p53/nf1/atrx-deficient tumors revealed that down-regulation of telomerase accompanied ALT-mediated lengthening of the telomeres in atrx-mutant samples. Moreover, inactivating mutations in atrx disturbed PRC2-target gene silencing, indicating a connection between ATRX loss and PRC2 dysfunction in cancer development.	2019-04	2024-03-06 19:47:07	2024-03-06T19:47:07Z		e1008039		4	15		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30970016 PMCID: PMC6476535					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Carcinogenesis; Disease Models, Animal; Erythropoiesis; Female; Gene Knockout Techniques; Globins; Humans; Loss of Function Mutation; Male; Neurofibromin 1; Sarcoma, Experimental; Telomere Homeostasis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; X-linked Nuclear Protein; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Expression and regulation of drug transporters in vertebrate neutrophils	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-017-04785-4		There remains a need to identify novel pro-resolution drugs for treatment of inflammatory disease. To date, there are no neutrophil-specific anti-inflammatory treatments in clinical use, perhaps due to our lack of understanding of how drugs access this complex cell type. Here we present the first comprehensive description and expression of both major classes of drug transporters, SLC and ABC, in resting human blood neutrophils. Moreover, we have studied the expression of these carriers in the tractable model system, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), additionally examining the evolutionary relationship between drug transporters in zebrafish and humans. We anticipate that this will be a valuable resource to the field of inflammation biology and will be an important asset in future anti-inflammatory drug design.	2017-07-10	2024-03-06 19:47:07	2024-03-06T19:47:07Z		4967		1	7		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28694436 PMCID: PMC5504015					ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Multigene Family; Neutrophils; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Solute Carrier Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, we perform NC-specific transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of foxd3-mutant cells in vivo to define the gene regulatory circuits controlling NC specification. Together with global binding analysis obtained by foxd3 biotin-ChIP and single cell profiles of foxd3-expressing premigratory NC, our analysis shows that, during early steps of NC formation, foxd3 acts globally as a pioneer factor to prime the onset of genes regulating NC specification and migration by re-arranging the chromatin landscape, opening cis-regulatory elements and reshuffling nucleosomes. Strikingly, foxd3 then gradually switches from an activator to its well-described role as a transcriptional repressor and potentially uses differential partners for each role. Taken together, these results demonstrate that foxd3 acts bimodally in the neural crest as a switch from "permissive" to "repressive" nucleosome and chromatin organization to maintain multipotency and define cell fates.	2018-12-03	2024-03-06 19:47:06	2024-03-06T19:47:06Z		608-628.e6		5	47		Dev Cell	From Pioneer to Repressor							eng					PubMed		PMID: 30513303 PMCID: PMC6286384					Animals; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neural Crest; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; chromatin dynamics; enhancer; foxd3; gene regulatory network; neural crest; pioneer factor; repressor; stem cells

In contrast to mammalian hair cells, zebrafish ear and lateral line hair cells regenerate from poorly characterized support cells. Equally ill-defined is the gene regulatory network underlying the progression of support cells to differentiated hair cells. scRNA-Seq of lateral line organs uncovered five different support cell types, including quiescent and activated stem cells. Ordering of support cells along a developmental trajectory identified self-renewing cells and genes required for hair cell differentiation. scRNA-Seq analyses of fgf3 mutants, in which hair cell regeneration is increased, demonstrates that Fgf and Notch signaling inhibit proliferation of support cells in parallel by inhibiting Wnt signaling. Our scRNA-Seq analyses set the foundation for mechanistic studies of sensory organ regeneration and is crucial for identifying factors to trigger hair cell production in mammals. The data is searchable and publicly accessible via a web-based interface.	2019-01-25	2024-03-06 19:47:06	2024-03-06T19:47:06Z		e44431			8		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30681411 PMCID: PMC6363392					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Hair Cells, Auditory; RNA, Small Cytoplasmic; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; developmental biology; hearing; lateral line system; regeneration; regenerative medicine; sensory hair cells; single cell RNA-Seq; stem cells; zebrafish

The present study examines changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern of adult male zebrafish progeny associated with high levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) in the parental diet. The parental generation (F0) was fed a diet which was either low (control) or high in ARA (high ARA). Progenies of both groups (F1) were given the control diet. No differences in body weight were found between the diet groups within adult stages of either F0 or F1 generation. Few differentially expressed genes were observed between the two dietary groups in the F0 in contrast to the F1 generation. Several links were found between the previous metabolic analysis of the parental fish and the gene expression analysis in their adult progeny. Main gene expression differences in the progeny were observed related to lipid and retinoid metabolism by PPARα/RXRα playing a central role in mediating changes to lipid and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The enrichment of genes involved in β-oxidation observed in the progeny, corresponded to the increase in peroxisomal β-oxidative degradation of long-chain fatty acids in the parental fish metabolomics data. Similar links between the F0 and F1 generation were identified for the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway in the high ARA group. In addition, estrogen signalling was found to be affected by parental high dietary ARA levels, where gene expression was opposite directed in F1 compared to F0. This study shows that the dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio can alter gene expression patterns in the adult progeny. Whether the effect is mediated by permanent epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in developing gametes needs to be further investigated.	2018	2024-03-06 19:47:05	2024-03-06T19:47:05Z		e0201278		8	13		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30070994 PMCID: PMC6071982					Animals; Arachidonic Acid; Dietary Fats; Liver; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Common and specific downstream signaling targets controlled by Tlr2 and Tlr5 innate immune signaling in zebrafish	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-015-1740-9		BACKGROUND: Although the responses to many pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in cell cultures and extracted organs are well characterized, there is little known of transcriptome responses to PAMPs in whole organisms. To characterize this in detail, we have performed RNAseq analysis of responses of zebrafish embryos to injection of PAMPs in the caudal vein at one hour after exposure. We have compared two ligands that in mammals have been shown to specifically activate the TLR2 and TLR5 receptors: Pam3CSK4 and flagellin, respectively. RESULTS: We identified a group of 80 common genes that respond with high stringency selection to stimulations with both PAMPs, which included several well-known immune marker genes such as il1b and tnfa. Surprisingly, we also identified sets of 48 and 42 genes that specifically respond to either Pam3CSK4 or flagellin, respectively, after a comparative filtering approach. Remarkably, in the Pam3CSK4 specific set, there was a set of transcription factors with more than 2 fold-change, as confirmed by qPCR analyses, including cebpb, fosb, nr4a1 and egr3. We also showed that the regulation of the Pam3CSK4 and flagellin specifically responding sets is inhibited by knockdown of tlr2 or tlr5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that Pam3CSK4 and flagellin can stimulate the Tlr2 and Tlr5 signaling pathways leading to common and specific responses in the zebrafish embryo system.	2015-07-25	2024-03-06 19:47:05	2024-03-06T19:47:05Z		547		1	16		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26208853 PMCID: PMC4514945					Animals; Flagellin; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Immunity, Innate; Ligands; Lipopeptides; NF-kappa B; Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 5; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Anthropogenic activities lead to the release of increasing amounts of uranium and depleted uranium (DU) in the environment, posing potential risks to aquatic organisms due to radiological and chemical toxicity of this radionucleide. Although environmental contaminations with high levels of uranium have already been observed, chronic exposures of non-human species to levels close to the environmental quality standards remain scarcely characterized. The present study focused on the identification of the molecular pathways impacted by a chronic exposure of zebrafish to 20 μg/L of DU during 10 days. The transcriptomic effects were evaluated by the use of the mRNAseq analysis in three organs of adult zebrafish, the brain the testis and the ovaries, and two developmental stages of the adult fish progeny, two-cells embryo and four-days larvae. The results highlight generic effects on the cell adhesion process, but also specific transcriptomic responses depending on the organ or the developmental stage investigated. The analysis of the transgenerational effects of DU-exposure on the four-day zebrafish larvae demonstrate an induction of genes involved in oxidative response (cat, mpx, sod1 and sod2), a decrease of expression of the two hatching enzymes (he1a and he1b), the deregulation of the expression of gene coding for the ATPase complex and the induction of cellular stress. Electron microscopy analysis of skeletal muscles on the four-days larvae highlights significant histological impacts on the ultrastructure of both the mitochondria and the myofibres. In addition, the comparison with the transcriptomic data obtained for the acetylcholine esterase mutant reveals the induction of protein-chaperons in the skeletal muscles of the progeny of fish chronically exposed to DU, pointing towards long lasting effects of this chemical in the muscles. The results presented in this study support the hypothesis that a chronic parental exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of DU could impair the progeny development with significant effects observed both at the molecular level and on the histological ultrastructure of organs. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset useful for ecotoxicological studies on other fish species at the molecular level. It also provides a key DU responsive gene, egr1, which may be a candidate biomarker for monitoring aquatic pollution by heavy metals.	2017	2024-03-06 19:47:05	2024-03-06T19:47:05Z		e0177932		5	12		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28531178 PMCID: PMC5439696					Animals; Brain; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Ovary; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Testis; Uranium; Water Pollutants, Radioactive; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The concomitant transcriptional response involves up-regulation of the three genes encoding these proteins, as well as genes involved in muscle development. The transcriptional up-regulation of unc45b, hsp90aa1.1 and smyd1b is specific to zebrafish mutants with myosin folding defects, and is not triggered in other zebrafish myopathy models. RESULTS: By dissecting the promoter of unc45b, we identify a Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) binding element as a mediator of unc45b up-regulation in myofibers lacking myosin folding proteins. Loss-of-function of Hsf1 abolishes unc45b up-regulation in mutants with defects in myosin folding. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data show that skeletal muscle cells respond to defective myosin chaperones with a complex gene program and suggest that this response is mediated by Hsf1 activation.	2015-12-03	2024-03-06 19:47:04	2024-03-06T19:47:04Z		267			16		Genome Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26631063 PMCID: PMC4668643					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Molecular Chaperones; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Mutation; Myosins; Protein Binding; Protein Folding; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

It has been proven that defects of ribosomal proteins can lead to this disease and that RPS19 is the most frequently mutated gene in DBA patients. Previous studies suggest that p53-dependent genes and pathways play important roles in RPS19-deficient embryos. However, whether there are other vital factors linked to DBA has not been fully clarified. In this study, we compared the whole genome RNA-Seq data of zebrafish embryos injected with RPS19 morpholino (RPS19 MO), RPS19 and p53 morpholino simultaneously (RPS19+p53 MO) and control morpholino (control). We found that genes enriched in the functions of hematological systems, nervous system development and skeletal and muscular disorders had significant differential expression in RPS19 MO embryos compared with controls. Co-inhibition of p53 partially alleviates the abnormalities for RPS19-deficient embryos. However, the hematopoietic genes, which were down-regulated significantly in RPS19 MO embryos, were not completely recovered by the co-inhibition of p53. Furthermore, we identified the genome-wide p53-dependent and -independent genes and pathways. These results indicate that not only p53 family members but also other factors have important impacts on RPS19-deficient embryos. The detection of potential pathogenic genes and pathways provides us a new paradigm for future research on DBA, which is a systematic and complex hereditary disease.	2013	2024-03-06 19:47:04	2024-03-06T19:47:04Z		e71782		8	8		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23990987 PMCID: PMC3747179					Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoietic System; Humans; In Situ Hybridization; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribosomal Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Genetic mutations in ribosome protein (RP) genes lead to DBA phenotypes, including hematopoietic defects and physical deformities. However, little is known about the global regulatory network as well as key miRNAs and gene pathways in the zebrafish model of DBA. RESULTS: In this study, we establish the DBA model in zebrafish using an RPS24 morpholino and found that RPS24 is required for both primitive hematopoiesis and definitive hematopoiesis processes that are partially mediated by the p53 pathway. Several deregulated genes and miRNAs were found to be related to hematopoiesis, vascular development and apoptosis in RPS24-deficient zebrafish via RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data analysis, and a comprehensive regulatory network was first constructed to identify the mechanisms of key miRNAs and gene pathways in the model. Interestingly, we found that the central node genes in the network were almost all targeted by significantly deregulated miRNAs. Furthermore, the enforced expression of miR-142-3p, a uniquely expressed miRNA, causes a significant decrease in primitive erythrocyte progenitor cells and HSCs. CONCLUSIONS: The present analyses demonstrate that the comprehensive regulatory network we constructed is useful for the functional prediction of new and important miRNAs in DBA and will provide insights into the pathogenesis of mutant rps24-mediated human DBA disease.	2014-09-04	2024-03-06 19:47:04	2024-03-06T19:47:04Z		759		1	15		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25189322 PMCID: PMC4169864					Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Erythroid Precursor Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Morpholinos; Phenotype; Ribosomal Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish

Despite its extensive usage to diverse biological problems in the last decade, transcriptomic researches approaching the zebrafish embryonic development have been very limited. Several recent studies have made great progress in this direction, yet the large gap still exists, especially regarding to the transcriptome dynamics of embryonic stages from early gastrulation onwards. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis about the transcriptomes of 9 different stages covering 7 major periods (cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, hatching and early larval stage) in zebrafish development, by recruiting the RNA-sequencing technology. We detected the expression for at least 24,065 genes in at least one of the 9 stages. We identified 16,130 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between stages and were subsequently classified into six clusters. Each revealed gene cluster had distinct expression patterns and characteristic functional pathways, providing a framework for the understanding of the developmental transcriptome dynamics. Over 4000 genes were identified as preferentially expressed in one of the stages, which could be of high relevance to stage-specific developmental and molecular events. Among the 68 transcription factor families active during development, most had enhanced average expression levels and thus might be crucial for embryogenesis, whereas the inactivation of the other families was likely required by the activation of the zygotic genome. We discussed our RNA-seq data together with previous findings about the Wnt signaling pathway and some other genes with known functions, to show how our data could be used to advance our understanding about these developmental functional elements. Our study provides ample information for further study about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying vertebrate development.	2013	2024-03-06 19:47:03	2024-03-06T19:47:03Z		e64058		5	8		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23700457 PMCID: PMC3659048					Animals; Blastula; Cleavage Stage, Ovum; Embryonic Development; Gastrula; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Larva; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Identification of small ORFs in vertebrates using ribosome footprinting and evolutionary conservation	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.1002/embj.201488411		Identification of the coding elements in the genome is a fundamental step to understanding the building blocks of living systems. Short peptides (< 100 aa) have emerged as important regulators of development and physiology, but their identification has been limited by their size. We have leveraged the periodicity of ribosome movement on the mRNA to define actively translated ORFs by ribosome footprinting. This approach identifies several hundred translated small ORFs in zebrafish and human. Computational prediction of small ORFs from codon conservation patterns corroborates and extends these findings and identifies conserved sequences in zebrafish and human, suggesting functional peptide products (micropeptides). These results identify micropeptide-encoding genes in vertebrates, providing an entry point to define their function in vivo.	2014-05-02	2024-03-06 19:47:03	2024-03-06T19:47:03Z		981-993		9	33		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24705786 PMCID: PMC4193932					Animals; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclease Protection Assays; Oligopeptides; Open Reading Frames; RNA, Messenger; Ribosomes; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

A zebrafish high throughput screening system used for Staphylococcus epidermidis infection marker discovery	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/1471-2164-14-255		BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria are a major cause of biomaterial-associated infections in modern medicine. Yet there is little known about the host responses against this normally innocent bacterium in the context of infection of biomaterials. In order to better understand the factors involved in this process, a whole animal model with high throughput screening possibilities and markers for studying the host response to S. epidermidis infection are required. RESULTS: We have used a zebrafish yolk injection system to study bacterial proliferation and the host response in a time course experiment of S. epidermidis infection. By combining an automated microinjection system with complex object parametric analysis and sorting (COPAS) technology we have quantified bacterial proliferation. This system was used together with transcriptome analysis at several time points during the infection period. We show that bacterial colony forming unit (CFU) counting can be replaced by high throughput flow-based fluorescence analysis of embryos enabling high throughput readout. Comparison of the host transcriptome response to S. epidermidis and Mycobacterium marinum infection in the same system showed that M. marinum has a far stronger effect on host gene regulation than S. epidermidis. However, multiple genes responded differently to S. epidermidis infection than to M. marinum, including a cell adhesion gene linked to specific infection by staphylococci in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: Our zebrafish embryo infection model allowed (i) quantitative assessment of bacterial proliferation, (ii) identification of zebrafish genes serving as markers for infection with the opportunistic pathogen S. epidermidis, and (iii) comparison of the transcriptome response of infection with S. epidermidis and with the pathogen M. marinum. As a result we have identified markers that can be used to distinguish common and specific responses to S. epidermidis. These markers enable the future integration of our high throughput screening technology with functional analyses of immune response genes and immune modulating factors.	2013-04-15	2024-03-06 19:47:03	2024-03-06T19:47:03Z		255			14		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23586901 PMCID: PMC3638012					Animals; Biomarkers; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Species Specificity; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

In one model, once an odorant receptor is chosen for expression, other receptor genes are suppressed by a negative feedback mechanism, ensuring a stable functional identity of the sensory neuron for the lifetime of the cell. The signal transduction mechanism subserving odorant receptor gene silencing remains obscure, however. Here, we demonstrate in the zebrafish that odorant receptor gene silencing is dependent on receptor activity. Moreover, we show that signaling through G protein βγ subunits is both necessary and sufficient to suppress the expression of odorant receptor genes and likely acts through histone methylation to maintain the silenced odorant receptor genes in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. These results link receptor activity with the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for ensuring the expression of one odorant receptor per olfactory sensory neuron.	2014-02-19	2024-03-06 19:47:02	2024-03-06T19:47:02Z		847-859		4	81		Neuron								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24559675 PMCID: PMC4412037					Animals; Axons; GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits; GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Receptors, Odorant; Sensory Receptor Cells; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

Systematic identification of long noncoding RNAs expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.133009.111		Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Recent genome-wide studies in humans and the mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time-series of RNA-seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1133 noncoding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to that of introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than are protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first systematic identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic, and evolutionary studies.	2012-03	2024-03-06 19:47:02	2024-03-06T19:47:02Z		577-591		3	22		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 22110045 PMCID: PMC3290793					Animals; Chromatin; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genomics; Mice; Open Reading Frames; Organ Specificity; RNA, Untranslated; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

The DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator DRAM1 links mycobacterial recognition via TLR-MYD88 to autophagic defense [corrected]	Cell Host & Microbe		1934-6069	10.1016/j.chom.2014.05.005		Autophagy is an important defense mechanism against mycobacteria, the causative agents of tuberculosis. The molecular mechanisms that link mycobacterial recognition to autophagy remain unclear. Our analysis in zebrafish and human macrophage models of mycobacterial infection reveals that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator DRAM1 functions downstream of pathogen recognition by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R)-MYD88-NF-κB innate immune sensing pathway to activate selective autophagy. Mycobacterial infection of human macrophages and zebrafish embryos induced DRAM1 expression in a MYD88 and NF-κB-dependent manner. DRAM1 knockdown increased mycobacterial infection, whereas overexpression lowered infection by hyperactivating autophagy. DRAM1-mediated selective autophagic defenses require the cytosolic DNA sensor STING and the selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. Contrary to its known role in autophagy-mediated cell death and cancer, this DRAM1 function is p53 independent. We propose that DRAM1 mediates autophagic defense against a broader range of intracellular pathogens, since DRAM1 expression was also induced by the common bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.	2014-06-11	2024-03-06 19:47:01	2024-03-06T19:47:01Z		753-767		6	15		Cell Host Microbe								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24922577					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Autophagy; Cells, Cultured; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, p53; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Lipopolysaccharides; Lysosomes; Macrophages; Membrane Proteins; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium Infections; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Interleukin-1; Sequestosome-1 Protein; Zebrafish

We probed the role of VDR in developing zebrafish biology by examining changes in expression of RNA by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) in fish treated with picomolar concentrations of the VDR ligand and hormonal form of vitamin D(3), 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1α,25(OH)(2)D(3))].We observed significant changes in RNAs of transcription factors, leptin, peptide hormones, and RNAs encoding proteins of fatty acid, amino acid, xenobiotic metabolism, receptor-activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), and calcitonin-like ligand receptor pathways. Early highly restricted, and subsequent massive changes in more than 10% of expressed cellular RNA were observed. At days post fertilization (dpf) 2 [24 h 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treatment], only four RNAs were differentially expressed (hormone vs. vehicle). On dpf 4 (72 h treatment), 77 RNAs; on dpf 6 (120 h treatment) 1039 RNAs; and on dpf 7 (144 h treatment), 2407 RNAs were differentially expressed in response to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3). Fewer RNAs (n = 481) were altered in dpf 7 larvae treated for 24 h with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) vs. those treated with hormone for 144 h. At dpf 7, in 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treated larvae, pharyngeal cartilage was larger and mineralization was greater. Changes in expression of RNAs for transcription factors, peptide hormones, and RNAs encoding proteins integral to fatty acid, amino acid, leptin, calcitonin-like ligand receptor, RANKL, and xenobiotic metabolism pathways, demonstrate heretofore unrecognized mechanisms by which 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) functions in vivo in developing eukaryotes.	2012-09	2024-03-06 19:47:01	2024-03-06T19:47:01Z		1630-1642		9	26		Mol Endocrinol	Research resource							eng					PubMed		PMID: 22734042 PMCID: PMC3434529					Animals; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Receptors, Calcitriol; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Vitamin D; Zebrafish

Arsenic exposure alters expression of cell cycle and lipid metabolism genes in the liver of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)	Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)		1879-1514	10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.10.006		Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to investigate mRNA expression in the liver following 7-day and 21-day exposures to 0, 10, 50, or 500 ppb sodium arsenite. Arsenic exposure has been linked to several human disorders including cancers and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Quantitative PCR was employed to determine the mRNA expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation [cyclin E1 (ccne1), WEE1 A kinase (wee1)], DNA damage repair [breast cancer 2 (brca2)] and lipid transport and metabolism [carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (crot), fatty acid binding protein-3 (fabp3) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (hmgcs1)]. Results from the 7-day exposure showed sex- and dose-specific changes in expression of wee1, brca2, crot and hmgcs1. No significant differences from controls were observed in fish exposed for 21 days. Expression of all genes, except ccne1, was significantly different between the 7- and 21-day exposures. The results presented here correlate with prior findings from our lab and others, and offer further insight into potential mechanisms of low-dose arsenic exposure.	2014-08	2024-03-06 19:47:01	2024-03-06T19:47:01Z		66-72			153		Aquat Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24176670					Animals; Arsenic; Arsenites; Cell Cycle; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Sex Factors; Sodium Compounds; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

To identify gene regulatory networks that reprogram Müller glia into progenitor cells, we profiled changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in Müller glia from zebrafish, chick, and mice in response to different stimuli. We identified evolutionarily conserved and species-specific gene networks controlling glial quiescence, reactivity, and neurogenesis. In zebrafish and chick, the transition from quiescence to reactivity is essential for retinal regeneration, whereas in mice, a dedicated network suppresses neurogenic competence and restores quiescence. Disruption of nuclear factor I transcription factors, which maintain and restore quiescence, induces Müller glia to proliferate and generate neurons in adult mice after injury. These findings may aid in designing therapies to restore retinal neurons lost to degenerative diseases.	2020-11-20	2024-03-06 19:46:59	2024-03-06T19:46:59Z		eabb8598		6519	370		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33004674 PMCID: PMC7899183					Animals; Cellular Reprogramming; Chickens; Ependymoglial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Mice; Nerve Regeneration; Neurogenesis; RNA-Seq; Zebrafish

Here, we present genome sequences of the bichir, paddlefish, bowfin, and alligator gar, covering all major early divergent lineages of ray-finned fishes. Our analyses show that these species exhibit many mosaic genomic features of lobe- and ray-finned fishes. In particular, many regulatory elements for limb development are present in these fishes, supporting the hypothesis that the relevant ancestral regulation networks emerged before the origin of tetrapods. Transcriptome analyses confirm the homology between the lung and swim bladder and reveal the presence of functional lung-related genes in early ray-finned fishes. Furthermore, we functionally validate the essential role of a jawed vertebrate highly conserved element for cardiovascular development. Our results imply the ancestors of jawed vertebrates already had the potential gene networks for cardio-respiratory systems supporting air breathing.	2021-03-04	2024-03-06 19:46:59	2024-03-06T19:46:59Z		1377-1391.e14		5	184		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33545088					Animal Fins; Animals; Biological Evolution; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Cardiovascular System; Extremities; Fishes; Genome; Lung; Phylogeny; Receptors, Odorant; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Vertebrates; basal ray-finned fishes; cardiorespiratory system; genome evolution; limb; lung; swim bladder; terrestrial adaptation; vertebrate landing

This provocative idea requires further testing in experimental models in which the molecular basis of disease-induced neuronal regeneration could be investigated. We previously found that zebrafish stimulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity and neurogenesis in AD and could help to understand the mechanisms to be harnessed for developing new neurons in diseased mammalian brains. Here, by performing single-cell transcriptomics, we found that amyloid toxicity-induced interleukin-4 (IL4) promotes NSC proliferation and neurogenesis by suppressing the tryptophan metabolism and reducing the production of serotonin. NSC proliferation was suppressed by serotonin via down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expression in serotonin-responsive periventricular neurons. BDNF enhances NSC plasticity and neurogenesis via nerve growth factor receptor A (NGFRA)/ nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NFkB) signaling in zebrafish but not in rodents. Collectively, our results suggest a complex neuron-glia interaction that regulates regenerative neurogenesis after AD conditions in zebrafish.	2020-01	2024-03-06 19:46:58	2024-03-06T19:46:58Z		e3000585		1	18		PLoS Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31905199 PMCID: PMC6964913					Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cell Communication; Disease Models, Animal; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nerve Regeneration; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Neuroimmunomodulation; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Serotonin; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Zebrafish remarkably regenerate their brain by inducing NSC plasticity in a Amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42)-induced experimental Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also critical for AD-induced NSC proliferation. However, the mechanisms of this response have remained unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomics in the adult zebrafish brain, we identify distinct subtypes of NSCs and neurons and differentially regulated pathways and their gene ontologies and investigate how cell-cell communication is altered through ligand-receptor pairs in AD conditions. Our results propose the existence of heterogeneous and spatially organized stem cell populations that react distinctly to amyloid toxicity. This resource article provides an extensive database for the molecular basis of NSC plasticity in the AD model of the adult zebrafish brain. Further analyses of stem cell heterogeneity and neuro-regenerative ability at single-cell resolution could yield drug targets for mobilizing NSCs for endogenous neuro-regeneration in humans.	2019-04-23	2024-03-06 19:46:57	2024-03-06T19:46:57Z		1307-1318.e3		4	27		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31018142					Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Fgf signaling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Interleukin-4; Neural Stem Cells; Neuronal Plasticity; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; amyloid-beta42; interaction map; interleukin-4; neural stem cell; neuron; plasticity; single cell sequencing; zebrafish

RPL11 mutations account for approximately 4.8% of human DBA cases with defective hematopoietic phenotypes. However, the mechanisms by which RPL11 regulates hematopoiesis in DBA remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome using deep sequencing data from an Rpl11-deficient zebrafish model to identify Rpl11-mediated hematopoietic failure and investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: We characterized hematological defects in Rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos by identifying affected hematological genes, hematopoiesis-associated pathways, and regulatory networks. We found that hemoglobin biosynthetic and hematological defects in Rpl11-deficient zebrafish were related to dysregulation of iron metabolism-related genes, including tfa, tfr1b, alas2 and slc25a37, which are involved in heme and hemoglobin biosynthesis. In addition, we found reduced expression of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) marker cmyb and HSC transcription factors tal1 and hoxb4a in Rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos, indicating that the hematopoietic defects may be related to impaired HSC formation, differentiation, and proliferation. However, Rpl11 deficiency did not affect the development of other blood cell lineages such as granulocytes and myelocytes. CONCLUSION: We identified hematopoietic failure of Rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos using transcriptome deep sequencing and elucidated potential underlying mechanisms. The present analyses demonstrate that Rpl11-deficient zebrafish may serve as a model of DBA and may provide insights into the pathogenesis of mutant RPL11-mediated human DBA disease.	2013-12-17	2024-03-06 19:46:57	2024-03-06T19:46:57Z		896			14		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24341334 PMCID: PMC3890587					Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Hemoglobins; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Iron; Ribosomal Proteins; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Acromegaly patients exhibit a deterioration of health and many associated complications, such as cardiovascular issues, arthritis, kidney diseases, muscular weakness, and colon cancer. Since these complications are generalized throughout the body, we investigated the effect of GH excess on cellular integrity. Here, we established stable acromegaly model zebrafish lines that overexpress tilapia GH and the red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporter gene for tracking GH gene expression throughout generations, and performed RNA-Seq data analysis from different organs. Intriguingly, heatmap and Expression2Kinases (X2K) analysis revealed the enrichment of DNA damage markers in various organs. Moreover, H2A.X immunostaining analysis in acromegaly zebrafish larvae and the adult acromegaly model brain and muscle showed a robust increase in the number of DNA-damaged cells. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that the acromegaly zebrafish model had impaired DNA repair pathways in the liver, such as double-strand break (DSB), homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and translesion synthesis (TLS). Interestingly, the impairment of DNA repair was even more prominent in acromegaly model than in aged zebrafish (three years old). Thus, our study demonstrates that affection of cellular integrity is characteristic of acromegaly.	2018-10-17	2024-03-06 19:46:57	2024-03-06T19:46:57Z		47		4	7		Biology (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30336646 PMCID: PMC6315448					DNA damage; DNA repair; acromegaly; growth hormone

However, sex differences in gene expression profiles in the brains of vertebrates are only beginning to be understood. Fishes provide a unique complement to studies of sex differences in mammals and birds given that fish show extreme plasticity and lability of sexually dimorphic characters and behaviors during development and even adulthood. Hence, teleost models can give additional insight into sexual differentiation. The goal of this study is to identify neurotranscriptomic mechanisms for sex differences in the brain. RESULTS: In this study we examined whole-brain sex-biased gene expression through RNA-sequencing across four strains of zebrafish. We subsequently conducted systems level analyses by examining gene network dynamics between the sexes using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. Surprisingly, only 61 genes (approximately 0.4% of genes analyzed) showed a significant sex effect across all four strains, and 48 of these differences were male-biased. Several of these genes are associated with steroid hormone biosynthesis. Despite sex differences in a display of stress-related behaviors, basal transcript levels did not predict the intensity of the behavioral display. WGCNA revealed only one module that was significantly associated with sex. Intriguingly, comparing intermodule dynamics between the sexes revealed only moderate preservation. Further we identify sex-specific gene modules. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior, there is limited sex-biased neural gene expression in zebrafish. Further, genes found to be sex-biased are associated with hormone biosynthesis, suggesting that sex steroid hormones may be key contributors to sexual behavioral plasticity seen in teleosts. A possible mechanism is through regulating specific brain gene networks.	2014-10-17	2024-03-06 19:46:56	2024-03-06T19:46:56Z		905		1	15		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25326170 PMCID: PMC4216363					Animals; Brain; Female; Fish Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sex Factors; Zebrafish

Parallel deep transcriptome and proteome analysis of zebrafish larvae	BMC research notes		1756-0500	10.1186/1756-0500-6-428		BACKGROUND: Sensitivity and throughput of transcriptomic and proteomic technologies have advanced tremendously in recent years. With the use of deep sequencing of RNA samples (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry technology for protein identification and quantitation, it is now feasible to compare gene and protein expression on a massive scale and for any organism for which genomic data is available. Although these technologies are currently applied to many research questions in various model systems ranging from cell cultures to the entire organism level, there are few comparative studies of these technologies in the same system, let alone on the same samples. Here we present a comparison between gene and protein expression in embryos of zebrafish, which is an upcoming model in disease studies. RESULTS: We compared Agilent custom made expression microarrays with Illumina deep sequencing for RNA analysis, showing as expected a high degree of correlation of expression of a common set of 18,230 genes. Gene expression was also found to correlate with the abundance of 963 distinct proteins, with several categories of genes as exceptions. These exceptions include ribosomal proteins, histones and vitellogenins, for which biological and technical explanations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing state of the art transcriptomic and proteomic technologies on samples derived from the same group of organisms we have for the first time benchmarked the differences in these technologies with regard to sensitivity and bias towards detection of particular gene categories in zebrafish. Our datasets submitted to public repositories are a good starting point for researchers interested in disease progression in zebrafish at a stage of development highly suited for high throughput screening technologies.	2013-10-24	2024-03-06 19:46:56	2024-03-06T19:46:56Z		428			6		BMC Res Notes								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24156766 PMCID: PMC4016144					Animals; Benchmarking; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Histones; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Proteome; Proteomics; Ribosomal Proteins; Transcriptome; Vitellogenins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

The Pu.1 target gene Zbtb11 regulates neutrophil development through its integrase-like HHCC zinc finger	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/ncomms14911		In response to infection and injury, the neutrophil population rapidly expands and then quickly re-establishes the basal state when inflammation resolves. The exact pathways governing neutrophil/macrophage lineage outputs from a common granulocyte-macrophage progenitor are still not completely understood. From a forward genetic screen in zebrafish, we identify the transcriptional repressor, ZBTB11, as critical for basal and emergency granulopoiesis. ZBTB11 sits in a pathway directly downstream of master myeloid regulators including PU.1, and TP53 is one direct ZBTB11 transcriptional target. TP53 repression is dependent on ZBTB11 cys116, which is a functionally critical, metal ion-coordinating residue within a novel viral integrase-like zinc finger domain. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a function for this domain in a cellular protein. We demonstrate that the PU.1-ZBTB11-TP53 pathway is conserved from fish to mammals. Finally, Zbtb11 mutant rescue experiments point to a ZBTB11-regulated TP53 requirement in development of other organs.	2017-04-06	2024-03-06 19:53:07	2024-03-06T19:53:07Z		14911			8		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28382966 PMCID: PMC5384227					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Databases, Protein; Leukopoiesis; Neutrophils; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Signal Transduction; Trans-Activators; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zinc Fingers

Microbiota regulate intestinal epithelial gene expression by suppressing the transcription factor Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.220111.116		Microbiota influence diverse aspects of intestinal physiology and disease in part by controlling tissue-specific transcription of host genes. However, host genomic mechanisms mediating microbial control of intestinal gene expression are poorly understood. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is the most ancient family of nuclear receptor transcription factors with important roles in human metabolic and inflammatory bowel diseases, but a role in host response to microbes is unknown. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we found that zebrafish Hnf4a specifically binds and activates a microbiota-suppressed intestinal epithelial transcriptional enhancer. Genetic analysis revealed that zebrafish hnf4a activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota, suggesting microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a. In support, analysis of genomic architecture in mouse intestinal epithelial cells disclosed that microbiota colonization leads to activation or inactivation of hundreds of enhancers along with drastic genome-wide reduction of HNF4A and HNF4G occupancy. Interspecies meta-analysis suggested interactions between HNF4A and microbiota promote gene expression patterns associated with human inflammatory bowel diseases. These results indicate a critical and conserved role for HNF4A in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in response to microbiota.	2017-07	2024-03-06 19:53:07	2024-03-06T19:53:07Z		1195-1206		7	27		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28385711 PMCID: PMC5495071					Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Expression Regulation; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice; Species Specificity; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Dynamic RNA-protein interactions underlie the zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.215954.116		During the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), transcriptionally silent embryos rely on post-transcriptional regulation of maternal mRNAs until zygotic genome activation (ZGA). RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important regulators of post-transcriptional RNA processing events, yet their identities and functions during developmental transitions in vertebrates remain largely unexplored. Using mRNA interactome capture, we identified 227 RBPs in zebrafish embryos before and during ZGA, hereby named the zebrafish MZT mRNA-bound proteome. This protein constellation consists of many conserved RBPs, some of which are potential stage-specific mRNA interactors that likely reflect the dynamics of RNA-protein interactions during MZT. The enrichment of numerous splicing factors like hnRNP proteins before ZGA was surprising, because maternal mRNAs were found to be fully spliced. To address potentially unique roles of these RBPs in embryogenesis, we focused on Hnrnpa1. iCLIP and subsequent mRNA reporter assays revealed a function for Hnrnpa1 in the regulation of poly(A) tail length and translation of maternal mRNAs through sequence-specific association with 3' UTRs before ZGA. Comparison of iCLIP data from two developmental stages revealed that Hnrnpa1 dissociates from maternal mRNAs at ZGA and instead regulates the nuclear processing of pri-mir-430 transcripts, which we validated experimentally. The shift from cytoplasmic to nuclear RNA targets was accompanied by a dramatic translocation of Hnrnpa1 and other pre-mRNA splicing factors to the nucleus in a transcription-dependent manner. Thus, our study identifies global changes in RNA-protein interactions during vertebrate MZT and shows that Hnrnpa1 RNA-binding activities are spatially and temporally coordinated to regulate RNA metabolism during early development.	2017-07	2024-03-06 19:53:07	2024-03-06T19:53:07Z		1184-1194		7	27		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28381614 PMCID: PMC5495070					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1; MicroRNAs; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

CXCR1 remodels the vascular niche to promote hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell engraftment	The Journal of Experimental Medicine		1540-9538	10.1084/jem.20161616		The microenvironment is an important regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) biology. Recent advances marking fluorescent HSPCs have allowed exquisite visualization of HSPCs in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of the developing zebrafish. Here, we show that the chemokine cxcl8 and its receptor, cxcr1, are expressed by zebrafish endothelial cells, and we identify cxcl8/cxcr1 signaling as a positive regulator of HSPC colonization. Single-cell tracking experiments demonstrated that this is a result of increases in HSPC-endothelial cell "cuddling," HSPC residency time within the CHT, and HSPC mitotic rate. Enhanced cxcl8/cxcr1 signaling was associated with an increase in the volume of the CHT and induction of cxcl12a expression. Finally, using parabiotic zebrafish, we show that cxcr1 acts HSPC nonautonomously to improve the efficiency of donor HSPC engraftment. This work identifies a mechanism by which the hematopoietic niche remodels to promote HSPC engraftment and suggests that cxcl8/cxcr1 signaling is a potential therapeutic target in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	2017-04-03	2024-03-06 19:53:06	2024-03-06T19:53:06Z		1011-1027		4	214		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28351983 PMCID: PMC5379982					Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cellular Microenvironment; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Interleukin-8; Receptors, Interleukin-8A; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

Organogenesis often starts with the formation of characteristically shaped organ precursors. However, the cellular mechanisms driving organ precursor formation are often not clear. Here, using zebrafish, we investigate the epithelial rearrangements responsible for the development of the hemispherical retinal neuroepithelium (RNE), a part of the optic cup. We show that in addition to basal shrinkage of RNE cells, active migration of connected epithelial cells into the RNE is a crucial player in its formation. This cellular movement is driven by progressive cell-matrix contacts and actively translocates prospective RNE cells to their correct location before they adopt neuroepithelial fate. Failure of this migration during neuroepithelium formation leads to ectopic determination of RNE cells and consequently impairs optic cup formation. Overall, this study illustrates how spatiotemporal coordination between morphogenic movements and fate determination critically influences organogenesis.	2017-04-04	2024-03-06 19:53:06	2024-03-06T19:53:06Z		e22689			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28372636 PMCID: PMC5380436					Animals; Cell Movement; Eye; Morphogenesis; Neuroepithelial Cells; Zebrafish; cell biology; collective cell migration; developmental biology; epithelial invagination; epithelial morphogenesis; retinal neuroepithelium; stem cells; zebrafish

Here, we describe a novel model of thyroid carcinoma in zebrafish that reveals temporal changes due to BRAFV600E. Through the use of real-time in vivo imaging, we observe disruption in thyroid follicle structure that occurs early in thyroid development. Combinatorial treatment using BRAF and MEK inhibitors reversed the developmental effects induced by BRAFV600E. Adult zebrafish expressing BRAFV600E in thyrocytes developed invasive carcinoma. We identified a gene expression signature from zebrafish thyroid cancer that is predictive of disease-free survival in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Gene expression studies nominated TWIST2 as a key effector downstream of BRAF. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically inactivate a TWIST2 orthologue, we suppressed the effects of BRAFV600E and restored thyroid morphology and hormone synthesis. These data suggest that expression of TWIST2 plays a role in an early step of BRAFV600E-mediated transformation.	2017-03-28	2024-03-06 19:53:05	2024-03-06T19:53:05Z		e20728			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28350298 PMCID: PMC5389860					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; EMT; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Morphogenesis; Mutant Proteins; Mutation, Missense; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Thyroid Neoplasms; Twist-Related Protein 2; Zebrafish; cancer biology; epithelial cells; gene expression; human biology; medicine; protooncogenes; zebrafish

Resolving Heart Regeneration by Replacement Histone Profiling	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2017.01.013		Chromatin regulation is a principal mechanism governing animal development, yet it is unclear to what extent structural changes in chromatin underlie tissue regeneration. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish activate cardiomyocyte (CM) division after tissue damage to regenerate lost heart muscle. Here, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing a biotinylatable H3.3 histone variant in CMs and derived cell-type-specific profiles of histone replacement. We identified an emerging program of putative enhancers that revise H3.3 occupancy during regeneration, overlaid upon a genome-wide reduction of H3.3 from promoters. In transgenic reporter lines, H3.3-enriched elements directed gene expression in subpopulations of CMs. Other elements increased H3.3 enrichment and displayed enhancer activity in settings of injury- and/or Neuregulin1-elicited CM proliferation. Dozens of consensus sequence motifs containing predicted transcription factor binding sites were enriched in genomic regions with regeneration-responsive H3.3 occupancy. Thus, cell-type-specific regulatory programs of tissue regeneration can be revealed by genome-wide H3.3 profiling.	2017-02-27	2024-03-06 19:53:05	2024-03-06T19:53:05Z		392-404.e5		4	40		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28245924 PMCID: PMC5367476					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; H3.3; Heart; Histones; Myocytes, Cardiac; Nucleotide Motifs; Regeneration; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; cardiomyocyte; chromatin; enhancer; epigenetic; gene regulation; heart; histone; profiling; regeneration; zebrafish

Using 3D whole-mount imaging, we reveal a highly dynamic endocardium during cardiac regeneration, including changes in cell morphology, behaviour and gene expression. These events lay the foundation for an initial expansion of the endocardium that matures to form a coherent endocardial structure within the injury site. We studied two important endocardial molecules, Serpine1 and Notch, which are implicated in different aspects of endocardial regeneration. Notch signalling regulates developmental gene expression and features of endocardial maturation. Also, Notch manipulation interferes with attenuation of the inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation. serpine1 is strongly expressed very early in the wound endocardium, with decreasing expression at later time points. serpine1 expression persists in Notch-abrogated hearts, via what appears to be a conserved mechanism. Functional inhibition studies show that Serpine1 controls endocardial maturation and proliferation and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Thus, we describe a highly dynamic endocardium in the regenerating zebrafish heart, with two key endocardial players, Serpine1 and Notch signalling, regulating crucial regenerative processes.	2017-04-15	2024-03-06 19:53:05	2024-03-06T19:53:05Z		1425-1440		8	144		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28242613					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Endocardium; Endothelial Cells; Freezing; Heart regeneration; Homeodomain Proteins; Inflammation; Models, Biological; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Notch; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Receptor, Notch1; Regeneration; Serpine1; Signal Transduction; Signalling; Sus scrofa; Up-Regulation; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here we show that over one-third of zebrafish maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified, and the clearance of these maternal mRNAs is facilitated by an m6A-binding protein, Ythdf2. Removal of Ythdf2 in zebrafish embryos decelerates the decay of m6A-modified maternal mRNAs and impedes zygotic genome activation. These embryos fail to initiate timely MZT, undergo cell-cycle pause, and remain developmentally delayed throughout larval life. Our study reveals m6A-dependent RNA decay as a previously unidentified maternally driven mechanism that regulates maternal mRNA clearance during zebrafish MZT, highlighting the critical role of m6A mRNA methylation in transcriptome switching and animal development.	2017-02-23	2024-03-06 19:53:04	2024-03-06T19:53:04Z		475-478		7642	542		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28192787 PMCID: PMC5323276					Adenosine; Animals; Embryonic Development; Female; Male; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger, Stored; RNA-Binding Proteins; Time Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

Microenvironment-derived factors driving metastatic plasticity in melanoma	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/ncomms14343		Cellular plasticity is a state in which cancer cells exist along a reversible phenotypic spectrum, and underlies key traits such as drug resistance and metastasis. Melanoma plasticity is linked to phenotype switching, where the microenvironment induces switches between invasive/MITFLO versus proliferative/MITFHI states. Since MITF also induces pigmentation, we hypothesize that macrometastatic success should be favoured by microenvironments that induce a MITFHI/differentiated/proliferative state. Zebrafish imaging demonstrates that after extravasation, melanoma cells become pigmented and enact a gene expression program of melanocyte differentiation. We screened for microenvironmental factors leading to phenotype switching, and find that EDN3 induces a state that is both proliferative and differentiated. CRISPR-mediated inactivation of EDN3, or its synthetic enzyme ECE2, from the microenvironment abrogates phenotype switching and increases animal survival. These results demonstrate that after metastatic dissemination, the microenvironment provides signals to promote phenotype switching and provide proof that targeting tumour cell plasticity is a viable therapeutic opportunity.	2017-02-09	2024-03-06 19:53:04	2024-03-06T19:53:04Z		14343			8		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28181494 PMCID: PMC5309794					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Differentiation; Cell Plasticity; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanoma; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phenotype; Tumor Microenvironment; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Melanoma genome evolution across species	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-017-3518-8		BACKGROUND: Cancer genomes evolve in both space and time, which contributes to the genetic heterogeneity that underlies tumor progression and drug resistance. In human melanoma, identifying mechanistically important events in tumor evolution is hampered due to the high background mutation rate from ultraviolet (UV) light. Cross-species oncogenomics is a powerful tool for identifying these core events, in which transgenically well-defined animal models of cancer are compared to human cancers to identify key conserved alterations. RESULTS: We use a zebrafish model of tumor progression and drug resistance for cross-species genomic analysis in melanoma. Zebrafish transgenic tumors are initiated with just 2 genetic lesions, BRAFV600E and p53-/-, yet take 4-6 months to appear, at which time whole genome sequencing demonstrated >3,000 new mutations. An additional 4-month exposure to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib resulted in a highly drug resistant tumor that showed 3 additional new DNA mutations in the genes BUB1B, PINK1, and COL16A1. These genetic changes in drug resistance are accompanied by a massive reorganization of the transcriptome, with differential RNA expression of over 800 genes, centered on alterations in cAMP and PKA signaling. By comparing both the DNA and mRNA changes to a large panel of human melanomas, we find that there is a highly significant enrichment of these alterations in human patients with vemurafenib resistant disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that targeting of alterations that are conserved between zebrafish and humans may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention. The approaches described here will be broadly applicable to the diverse array of cancer models available in the zebrafish, which can be used to inform human cancer genomics.	2017-02-07	2024-03-06 19:53:03	2024-03-06T19:53:03Z		136		1	18		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28173755 PMCID: PMC5297047					Animals; Cancer; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug-resistance; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Melanoma; Mutation; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity; Zebrafish

TP53 Modulates Oxidative Stress in Gata1+ Erythroid Cells	Stem Cell Reports		2213-6711	10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.12.025		Metabolism of oxidative stress is necessary for cellular survival. We have previously utilized the zebrafish as a model of the oxidative stress response. In this study, we found that gata1-expressing erythroid cells contributed to a significant proportion of total-body oxidative stress when animals were exposed to a strong pro-oxidant. RNA-seq of zebrafish under oxidative stress revealed the induction of tp53. Zebrafish carrying tp53 with a mutation in its DNA-binding domain were acutely sensitive to pro-oxidant exposure and displayed significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tp53-independent erythroid cell death resulting in an edematous phenotype. We found that a major contributing factor to ROS was increased basal mitochondrial respiratory rate without reserve. These data add to the concept that tp53, while classically a tumor suppressor and cell-cycle regulator, has additional roles in controlling cellular oxidative stress.	2017-02-14	2024-03-06 19:53:03	2024-03-06T19:53:03Z		360-372		2	8		Stem Cell Reports								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28132886 PMCID: PMC5312256					Animals; Cell Death; Erythroid Cells; GATA1 Transcription Factor; Gene Knockout Techniques; Gene Silencing; Mice; Mitochondria; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; erythroid precursors; mitochondria; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; tp53; zebrafish

RVIQU5LH	journalArticle	2017	Liu, Dong Teng; Brewer, Michael S.; Chen, Shixi; Hong, Wanshu; Zhu, Yong	Transcriptomic signatures for ovulation in vertebrates	General and Comparative Endocrinology		1095-6840	10.1016/j.ygcen.2017.01.019		The central roles of luteinizing hormone (LH), progestin and their receptors for initiating ovulation have been well established. However, signaling pathways and downstream targets such as proteases that are essential for the rupture of follicular cells are still unclear. Recently, we found anovulation in nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr) knockout (Pgr-KO) zebrafish, which offers a new model for examining genes and pathways that are important for ovulation and fertility. In this study, we examined expression of all transcripts using RNA-Seq in preovulatory follicular cells collected following the final oocyte maturation, but prior to ovulation, from wild-type (WT) or Pgr-KO fish. Differential expression analysis revealed 3567 genes significantly differentially expressed between WT and Pgr-KO fish (fold change⩾2, p<0.05). Among those, 1543 gene transcripts were significantly more expressed, while 2024 genes were significantly less expressed, in WT than those in Pgr-KO. We then retrieved and compared transcriptional data from online databases and further identified 661 conserved genes in fish, mice, and humans that showed similar levels of high (283 genes) or low (387) expression in animals that were ovulating compared to those with no ovulation. For the first time, ovulatory genes and their involved biological processes and pathways were also visualized using Enrichment Map and Cytoscape. Intriguingly, enrichment analysis indicated that the genes with higher expression were involved in multiple ovulatory pathways and processes such as inflammatory response, angiogenesis, cytokine production, cell migration, chemotaxis, MAPK, focal adhesion, and cytoskeleton reorganization. In contrast, the genes with lower expression were mainly involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA methylation, RNA processing, telomere maintenance, spindle assembling, nuclear acid transport, catabolic processes, and nuclear and cell division. Our results indicate that a large set of genes (>3000) is differentially regulated in the follicular cells in zebrafish prior to ovulation, terminating programs such as growth and proliferation, and beginning processes including the inflammatory response and apoptosis. Further studies are required to establish relationships among these genes and an ovulatory circuit in the zebrafish model.	2017-06-01	2024-03-06 19:53:02	2024-03-06T19:53:02Z		74-86			247		Gen Comp Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28111234 PMCID: PMC5410184					Animals; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Knockout Techniques; Humans; Knockout; Mice; Ovulation; Pgr; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, Progesterone; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Analysis, RNA; TALENs; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish

Short bowel syndrome results in increased gene expression associated with proliferation, inflammation, bile acid synthesis and immune system activation: RNA sequencing a zebrafish SBS model	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-016-3433-4		BACKGROUND: Much of the morbidity associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS) is attributed to effects of decreased enteral nutrition and administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). We hypothesized that acute SBS alone has significant effects on gene expression beyond epithelial proliferation, and tested this in a zebrafish SBS model. METHODS: In a model of SBS in zebrafish (laparotomy, proximal stoma, distal ligation, n = 29) or sham (laparotomy alone, n = 28) surgery, RNA-Seq was performed after 2 weeks. The proximal intestine was harvested and RNA isolated. The three samples from each group with the highest amount of RNA were spiked with external RNA controls consortium (ERCC) controls, sequenced and aligned to reference genome with gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis performed. Gene expression of ctnnb1, ccnb1, ccnd1, cyp7a1a, dkk3, ifng1-2, igf2a, il1b, lef1, nos2b, saa1, stat3, tnfa and wnt5a were confirmed to be elevated in SBS by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: RNA-seq analysis identified 1346 significantly upregulated genes and 678 significantly downregulated genes in SBS zebrafish intestine compared to sham with Ingenuity analysis. The upregulated genes were involved in cell proliferation, acute phase response signaling, innate and adaptive immunity, bile acid regulation, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, cellular barrier and coagulation. The downregulated genes were involved in folate synthesis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty-acid oxidation and activation and drug and steroid metabolism. RT-qPCR confirmed gene expression differences from RNA-Sequencing. CONCLUSION: Changes of gene expression after 2 weeks of SBS indicate complex and extensive alterations of multiple pathways, some previously implicated as effects of TPN. The systemic sequelae of SBS alone are significant and indicate multiple targets for investigating future therapies.	2017-01-25	2024-03-06 19:53:02	2024-03-06T19:53:02Z		23		1	18		BMC Genomics	Short bowel syndrome results in increased gene expression associated with proliferation, inflammation, bile acid synthesis and immune system activation							eng					PubMed		PMID: 28118819 PMCID: PMC5264326					Animals; Bile Acids and Salts; Cell Proliferation; Cell proliferation; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Immune System; Inflammation; Innate and adaptive immunity; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestinal resection; RNA sequencing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Short Bowel Syndrome; Short bowel syndrome; Zebrafish

Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic landscape of positional memory in the caudal fin of zebrafish	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1620755114		Regeneration requires cells to regulate proliferation and patterning according to their spatial position. Positional memory is a property that enables regenerating cells to recall spatial information from the uninjured tissue. Positional memory is hypothesized to rely on gradients of molecules, few of which have been identified. Here, we quantified the global abundance of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the proximodistal axis of caudal fins of uninjured and regenerating adult zebrafish. Using this approach, we uncovered complex overlapping expression patterns for hundreds of molecules involved in diverse cellular functions, including development, bioelectric signaling, and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Moreover, 32 genes differentially expressed at the RNA level had concomitant differential expression of the encoded proteins. Thus, the identification of proximodistal differences in levels of RNAs, proteins, and metabolites will facilitate future functional studies of positional memory during appendage regeneration.	2017-01-31	2024-03-06 19:53:02	2024-03-06T19:53:02Z		E717-E726		5	114		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28096348 PMCID: PMC5293114					Animal Fins; Animals; Female; Male; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Regeneration; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; caudal fin; growth control; positional memory; regeneration; zebrafish

We demonstrate that Notch signaling is an integral part of the Wnt and Fgf signaling feedback loop coordinating cell migration and the self-organization of rosette-shaped sensory organs in the zebrafish lateral line system. We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction. Our analysis also demonstrates that in the absence of patterning cues normally provided by a Wnt/Fgf signaling system, rosettes still self-organize in the presence of Notch signaling.	2017-01-13	2024-03-06 19:53:01	2024-03-06T19:53:01Z		e21049			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28085667 PMCID: PMC5235355					Animals; Hippo pathway; Morphogenesis; Organ Size; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; apical constriction; cell adhesion; cell biology; collective cell migration; developmental biology; lateral line system; rosettes; stem cells; zebrafish

A representative flame retardant, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47), was found to disrupt zebrafish development in visual perception and bone formation in previous study, thus here we investigated its effects on miRNA expression profiling of 6 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae by deep sequencing. To overcome the shortage of zebrafish miRNA annotation, multiple data processing approaches, especially constructed network based on the interactions between miRNAs and enrichment terms, were adopted and helped us acquire several validated zebrafish miRNAs and two novel miRNAs in BDE47-induced effects, and identify corresponding biological processes of the miRNAs. Among them, miR-735 was supposed to play essential roles in larval sensory development according to analysis results. Our study also provided an effective strategy for analyzing biological effects on non-mammalian miRNAs with limited basic information.	2017	2024-03-06 19:53:01	2024-03-06T19:53:01Z		e0169599		1	12		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28072866 PMCID: PMC5225001					Animals; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; MicroRNAs; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Here we show how developing zebrafish spinal cord neurons coordinate vessel growth through balancing of neuron-derived Vegfaa, with neuronal sFlt1 restricting Vegfaa-Kdrl mediated angiogenesis at the neurovascular interface. Neuron-specific loss of flt1 or increased neuronal vegfaa expression promotes angiogenesis and peri-neural tube vascular network formation. Combining loss of neuronal flt1 with gain of vegfaa promotes sprout invasion into the neural tube. On loss of neuronal flt1, ectopic sprouts emanate from veins involving special angiogenic cell behaviours including nuclear positioning and a molecular signature distinct from primary arterial or secondary venous sprouting. Manipulation of arteriovenous identity or Notch signalling established that ectopic sprouting in flt1 mutants requires venous endothelium. Conceptually, our data suggest that spinal cord vascularization proceeds from veins involving two-tiered regulation of neuronal sFlt1 and Vegfaa via a novel sprouting mode.	2017-01-10	2024-03-06 19:53:01	2024-03-06T19:53:01Z		13991			8		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28071661 PMCID: PMC5234075					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Biomarkers; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mutation; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Neurons; Receptors, Notch; Spinal Cord; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1; Veins; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the developmental role of Gbf1 in vertebrates remains elusive. In this study, we report the zebrafish mutant line tsu3994 that arises from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mediated mutagenesis and is characterized by prominent intracerebral and trunk hemorrhage. The mutant embryos develop hemorrhage accompanied by fewer pigments and shorter caudal fin at day 2 of development. The hemorrhage phenotype is caused by vascular breakage in a cell autonomous fashion. Positional cloning identifies a T → G nucleotide substitution in the 23rd exon of the gbf1 locus, resulting in a leucine → arginine substitution (L1246R) in the HDS2 domain. The mutant phenotype is mimicked by gbf1 knockouts and morphants, suggesting a nature of loss of function. Experimental results in mammalian cells show that the mutant form Gbf1(L1246R) is unable to be recruited to the Golgi apparatus and fails to activate Arf1 for recruiting COPI complex. The hemorrhage in tsu3994 mutants can be prevented partially and temporally by treating with the endoplasmic reticulum stress/apoptosis inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid or by knocking down the proapoptotic gene baxb Therefore, endothelial endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent apoptosis induced by gbf1 deficiency may account for the vascular collapse and hemorrhage.	2017-02-10	2024-03-06 19:53:00	2024-03-06T19:53:00Z		2315-2327		6	292		J Biol Chem								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28003365 PMCID: PMC5313103					Animals; Blood Vessels; Coat Protein Complex I; Golgi; Golgi Apparatus; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Hemorrhage; Mutation; Protein Transport; Zebrafish; embryo; protein trafficking (Golgi); vascular; zebrafish

It is poorly understood how the adrenal glucocorticoid hormones contribute to the coordination of daily global patterns of transcription and metabolism. Here, we examined diurnal metabolite and transcriptome patterns in a zebrafish glucocorticoid deficiency model by RNA-Seq, NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-based methods. We observed dysregulation of metabolic pathways including glutaminolysis, the citrate and urea cycles and glyoxylate detoxification. Constant, non-rhythmic glucocorticoid treatment rescued many of these changes, with some notable exceptions among the amino acid related pathways. Surprisingly, the non-rhythmic glucocorticoid treatment rescued almost half of the entire dysregulated diurnal transcriptome patterns. A combination of E-box and glucocorticoid response elements is enriched in the rescued genes. This simple enhancer element combination is sufficient to drive rhythmic circadian reporter gene expression under non-rhythmic glucocorticoid exposure, revealing a permissive function for the hormones in glucocorticoid-dependent circadian transcription. Our work highlights metabolic pathways potentially contributing to morbidity in patients with glucocorticoid deficiency, even under glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Moreover, we provide mechanistic insight into the interaction between the circadian clock and glucocorticoids in the transcriptional regulation of metabolism.	2016-12	2024-03-06 19:53:00	2024-03-06T19:53:00Z		e1006512		12	12		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27941970 PMCID: PMC5191836					Animals; CLOCK Proteins; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Citric Acid; E-Box Elements; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucocorticoids; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hormones; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Urea; Zebrafish

We developed a zebrafish model of brain tumours based on somatic expression of oncogenes that activate MAPK and PI3K signalling in neural progenitor cells and found that HRASV12 was the most effective in inducing both heterotopia and invasive tumours. Tumours, but not heterotopias, require persistent activation of phospho (p)-ERK and express a gene signature similar to the mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype, with a strong YAP component. Application of an eight-gene signature to human brain tumours establishes that YAP activation distinguishes between mesenchymal glioblastoma and low grade glioma in a wide The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sample set including gliomas and glioblastomas (GBMs). This suggests that the activation of YAP might be an important event in brain tumour development, promoting malignant versus benign brain lesions. Indeed, co-expression of dominant-active YAP (YAPS5A) and HRASV12 abolishes the development of heterotopias and leads to the sole development of aggressive tumours. Thus, we have developed a model proving that neurodevelopmental disorders and brain tumours might originate from the same activation of oncogenes through somatic mutations, and established that YAP activation is a hallmark of malignant brain tumours.	2017-01-01	2024-03-06 19:52:59	2024-03-06T19:52:59Z		15-28		1	10		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27935819 PMCID: PMC5278524					Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Clone Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, ras; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Heterotopia; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mesoderm; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Neural Stem Cells; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; RAS; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Telencephalon; Trans-Activators; YAP; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here we report that chromatin remodelling factor Brg1 is essential for adult heart regeneration. Brg1 mRNA and protein are induced during heart regeneration. Transgenic over-expression of dominant-negative Xenopus Brg1 inhibits the formation of BrdU+/Mef2C+ and Tg(gata4:EGFP) cardiomyocytes, leading to severe cardiac fibrosis and compromised myocardial regeneration. RNA-seq and RNAscope analyses reveal that inhibition of Brg1 increases the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as cdkn1a and cdkn1c in the myocardium after ventricular resection; and accordingly, myocardial-specific expression of dn-xBrg1 blunts myocardial proliferation and regeneration. Mechanistically, injury-induced Brg1, via its interaction with Dnmt3ab, suppresses the expression of cdkn1c by increasing the methylation level of CpG sites at the cdkn1c promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that Brg1 promotes heart regeneration by repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors partly through Dnmt3ab-dependent DNA methylation.	2016-12-08	2024-03-06 19:52:59	2024-03-06T19:52:59Z		13787			7		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27929112 PMCID: PMC5476829					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57; DNA Methylation; Heart; Myocardium; Regeneration; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

We report here the isolation, cloning and functional analysis of the mutated eftud2 (snu114) in a novel neuronal mutant fn10a in zebrafish. This mutant displayed abnormal brain development with evident neuronal apoptosis while the development of other organs appeared less affected. Positional cloning revealed a nonsense mutation such that the mutant eftud2 mRNA encoded a truncated Eftud2 protein and was subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Disruption of eftud2 led to increased apoptosis and mitosis of neural progenitors while it had little effect on differentiated neurons. Further RNA-seq and functional analyses revealed a transcriptome-wide RNA splicing deficiency and a large amount of intron-retaining and exon-skipping transcripts, which resulted in inadequate nonsense-mediated RNA decay and activation of the p53 pathway in fn10a mutants. Therefore, our study has established that eftud2 functions in RNA splicing during neural development and provides a suitable zebrafish model for studying the molecular pathology of the neurological disease MFDGA.	2017-04-07	2024-03-06 19:52:58	2024-03-06T19:52:58Z		3422-3436		6	45		Nucleic Acids Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27899647 PMCID: PMC5389467					Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Cloning, Molecular; Exons; Introns; Mutation; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay; Peptide Elongation Factors; RNA Splicing; RNA Splicing Factors; Spinal Cord; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Mutations in FUS have been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We genetically disrupted fus in zebrafish (Danio rerio) using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The fus knockout animals are fertile and did not show any distinctive phenotype. Mutation of fus induces mild changes in gene expression on the transcriptome and proteome level in the adult brain. We observed a significant influence of genetic background on gene expression and 3'UTR usage, which could mask the effects of loss of Fus. Unlike published fus morphants, maternal zygotic fus mutants do not show motoneuronal degeneration and exhibit normal locomotor activity.	2017-01-02	2024-03-06 19:52:58	2024-03-06T19:52:58Z		29-35		1	14		RNA Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27898262 PMCID: PMC5270537					3' Untranslated Regions; Alleles; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Brain; CRISPR-Cas Systems; CRISPR-Cas9; Danio rerio; Exons; Fus; Gene Knockout Techniques; Gene Targeting; Genetic Background; Genotype; Proteome; RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems; RNA-Binding Protein FUS; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; genetic knockout; morpholino; zebrafish

In the present study, we sequenced circRNAs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and identified 3868 circRNAs using three algorithms (find_circ, CIRI, segemehl). The analysis of microRNA target sites on circRNAs shows that some circRNAs may function as miRNA sponges. Furthermore, we identified the existence of reverse complementary sequences in the flanking regions of only 25 (2.64%) exonic circRNAs, indicating that the mechanism of zebrafish exonic circRNA biogenesis might be different from that in mammals. Moreover, 1122 (29%) zebrafish circRNA sequences showed homology with human, mouse and coelacanth circRNAs.	2017-01	2024-03-06 19:52:57	2024-03-06T19:52:57Z		213-220		1	591		FEBS Lett								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27878987					Animals; Base Sequence; Humans; Introns; Mice; MicroRNAs; RNA; RNA, Circular; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Zebrafish; circRNAs biogenesis; homology; zebrafish

Our forward genetic screens in zebrafish for recessive mutations affecting early T cell development revealed several major genetic pathways. The identification of lineage-specific transcription factors and specific components of cytokine signaling and DNA replication and/or repair pathways known from studies of immunocompromised mammals provided an evolutionary cross-validation of the screen design. Unexpectedly, however, genes encoding proteins required for pre-mRNA processing were enriched in the collection of mutants identified here. In both zebrafish and mice, deficiency of the splice regulator TNPO3 impairs intrathymic T cell differentiation, illustrating the evolutionarily conserved and cell-type-specific functions of certain pre-mRNA-processing factors for T cell development.	2016-11-22	2024-03-06 19:52:57	2024-03-06T19:52:57Z		2259-2270		9	17		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27880902 PMCID: PMC5149563					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Epistasis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Testing; Larva; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Organ Specificity; RNA Precursors; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Messenger; Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear; T cell development; T-Lymphocytes; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; beta Karyopherins; genetic screen; immunodeficiency; mouse; pre-mRNA splicing; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
SMFCH7AL	journalArticle	2016	Newman, Trent; Jhinku, Noel; Meier, Michael; Horsfield, Julia	Dietary Intake Influences Adult Fertility and Offspring Fitness in Zebrafish	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0166394		The burden of malnutrition, including both over- and undernutrition, is a major public health concern. Here we used a zebrafish model of diet-induced obesity to analyze the impact of dietary intake on fertility and the phenotype of the next generation. Over an eight-week period, one group received 60 mg of food each day (60 mg arm), while another received 5 mg (5 mg arm). At the end of the diet, the body mass index of the 60 mg arm was 1.5 fold greater than the 5 mg arm. The intervention also had a marked impact on fertility; breeding success and egg production in the 60 mg arm were increased 2.1- and 6.2-fold compared to the 5 mg arm, respectively. Transcriptome analysis of eggs revealed that transcripts involved in metabolic biological processes differed according to dietary intake. The progeny from the differentially fed fish were more likely to survive when the parents had access to more food. An intergenerational crossover study revealed that while parental diet did not influence weight gain in the offspring, the progeny of well-fed parents had increased levels of physical activity when exposed again to high nutrient availability. We conclude that dietary intake has an important influence on fertility and the subsequent fitness of offspring, even prior to breeding.	2016	2024-03-06 19:52:56	2024-03-06T19:52:56Z		e0166394		11	11		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27870856 PMCID: PMC5117665					Animals; Body Mass Index; Cross-Over Studies; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Eating; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fertility; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Fitness; Humans; Male; Obesity; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Injury-induced ctgfa directs glial bridging and spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aaf2679		Unlike mammals, zebrafish efficiently regenerate functional nervous system tissue after major spinal cord injury. Whereas glial scarring presents a roadblock for mammalian spinal cord repair, glial cells in zebrafish form a bridge across severed spinal cord tissue and facilitate regeneration. We performed a genome-wide profiling screen for secreted factors that are up-regulated during zebrafish spinal cord regeneration. We found that connective tissue growth factor a (ctgfa) is induced in and around glial cells that participate in initial bridging events. Mutations in ctgfa disrupted spinal cord repair, and transgenic ctgfa overexpression or local delivery of human CTGF recombinant protein accelerated bridging and functional regeneration. Our study reveals that CTGF is necessary and sufficient to stimulate glial bridging and natural spinal cord regeneration.	2016-11-04	2024-03-06 19:52:56	2024-03-06T19:52:56Z		630-634		6312	354		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27811277 PMCID: PMC5114142					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Connective Tissue Growth Factor; Female; Male; Mutation; Neuroglia; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Cord Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

MEK Inhibitors Reverse Growth of Embryonal Brain Tumors Derived from Oligoneural Precursor Cells	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2016.09.081		Malignant brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the CNS (CNS-PNETs) are particularly aggressive embryonal tumors of unknown cellular origin. Recent genomic studies have classified CNS-PNETs into molecularly distinct subgroups that promise to improve diagnosis and treatment; however, the lack of cell- or animal-based models for these subgroups prevents testing of rationally designed therapies. Here, we show that a subset of CNS-PNETs co-express oligoneural precursor cell (OPC) markers OLIG2 and SOX10 with coincident activation of the RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Modeling NRAS activation in embryonic OPCs generated malignant brain tumors in zebrafish that closely mimic the human oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET subgroup by histology and comparative oncogenomics. The zebrafish CNS-PNET model was used to show that MEK inhibitors selectively eliminate Olig2+/Sox10+ CNS-PNET tumors in vivo without impacting normal brain development. Thus, MEK inhibitors represent a promising rationally designed therapy for children afflicted with oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNETs.	2016-10-25	2024-03-06 19:52:55	2024-03-06T19:52:55Z		1255-1264		5	17		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27783941					Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; CNS-PNET; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome; MAP Kinase Signaling System; MAPK; MEK inhibitors; Membrane Proteins; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive; OLIG2; Oncogenes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RAS; SOX10; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; embryonal; oligodendrocyte; pediatric brain tumors; zebrafish

Identification of a conserved and acute neurodegeneration-specific microglial transcriptome in the zebrafish	Glia		1098-1136	10.1002/glia.23083		Microglia are brain resident macrophages important for brain development, connectivity, homeostasis and disease. However, it is still largely unclear how microglia functions and their identity are regulated at the molecular level. Although recent transcriptomic studies have identified genes specifically expressed in microglia, the function of most of these genes in microglia is still unknown. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on microglia acutely isolated from healthy and neurodegenerative zebrafish brains. We found that a large fraction of the mouse microglial signature is conserved in the zebrafish, corroborating the use of zebrafish to help understand microglial genetics in mammals in addition to studying basic microglia biology. Second, our transcriptome analysis of microglia following neuronal ablation suggested primarily a proliferative response of microglia, which we confirmed by immunohistochemistry and in vivo imaging. Together with the recent improvements in genome editing technology in zebrafish, these data offer opportunities to facilitate functional genetic research on microglia in vivo in the healthy as well as in the diseased brain.

Rapid, Dynamic Activation of Müller Glial Stem Cell Responses in Zebrafish	Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science		1552-5783	10.1167/iovs.16-19973		PURPOSE: Zebrafish neurons regenerate from Müller glia following retinal lesions. Genes and signaling pathways important for retinal regeneration in zebrafish have been described, but our understanding of how Müller glial stem cell properties are regulated is incomplete. Mammalian Müller glia possess a latent neurogenic capacity that might be enhanced in regenerative therapies to treat degenerative retinal diseases. METHODS: To identify transcriptional changes associated with stem cell properties in zebrafish Müller glia, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis from isolated cells at 8 and 16 hours following an acute photic lesion, prior to the asymmetric division that produces retinal progenitors. RESULTS: We report a rapid, dynamic response of zebrafish Müller glia, characterized by activation of pathways related to stress, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, cytokine signaling, immunity, prostaglandin metabolism, circadian rhythm, and pluripotency, and an initial repression of Wnt signaling. When we compared publicly available transcriptomes of isolated mouse Müller glia from two retinal degeneration models, we found that mouse Müller glia showed evidence of oxidative stress, variable responses associated with immune regulation, and repression of pathways associated with pluripotency, development, and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Categories of biological processes/pathways activated following photoreceptor loss in regeneration-competent zebrafish Müller glia, which distinguished them from mouse Müller glia in retinal degeneration models, included cytokine signaling (notably NF-κB), prostaglandin E2 synthesis, expression of core clock genes, and pathways/metabolic states associated with pluripotency. These regulatory mechanisms are relatively unexplored as potential mediators of stem cell properties likely to be important in Müller glial cells for successful retinal regeneration.	2016-10-01	2024-03-06 19:52:54	2024-03-06T19:52:54Z		5148-5160		13	57		Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27699411 PMCID: PMC5054728					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Electroretinography; Ependymoglial Cells; Nerve Regeneration; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Neurons; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Zebrafish

The transcription factor, Nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (Nfe2), is a regulator of the oxidative stress response during Danio rerio development	Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)		1879-1514	10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.09.019		Development is a complex and well-defined process characterized by rapid cell proliferation and apoptosis. At this stage in life, a developmentally young organism is more sensitive to toxicants as compared to an adult. In response to pro-oxidant exposure, members of the Cap'n'Collar (CNC) basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) transcription factor family (including Nfe2 and Nfe2-related factors, Nrfs) activate the expression of genes whose protein products contribute to reduced toxicity. Here, we studied the role of the CNC protein, Nfe2, in the developmental response to pro-oxidant exposure in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Following acute waterborne exposures to diquat or tert-buytlhydroperoxide (tBOOH) at one of three developmental stages, wildtype (WT) and nfe2 knockout (KO) embryos and larvae were morphologically scored and their transcriptomes sequenced. Early in development, KO animals suffered from hypochromia that was made more severe through exposure to pro-oxidants; this phenotype in the KO may be linked to decreased expression of alas2, a gene involved in heme synthesis. WT and KO eleutheroembryos and larvae were phenotypically equally affected by exposure to pro-oxidants, where tBOOH caused more pronounced phenotypes as compared to diquat. Comparing diquat and tBOOH exposed embryos relative to the WT untreated control, a greater number of genes were up-regulated in the tBOOH condition as compared to diquat (tBOOH: 304 vs diquat: 148), including those commonly found to be differentially regulated in the vertebrate oxidative stress response (OSR) (e.g. hsp70.2, txn1, and gsr). When comparing WT and KO across all treatments and times, there were 1170 genes that were differentially expressed, of which 33 are known targets of the Nrf proteins Nrf1 and Nrf2. More specifically, in animals exposed to pro-oxidants a total of 968 genes were differentially expressed between WT and KO across developmental time, representing pathways involved in coagulation, embryonic organ development, body fluid level regulation, erythrocyte differentiation, and oxidation-reduction, amongst others. The greatest number of genes that changed in expression between WT and KO occurred in animals exposed to diquat at 2h post fertilization (hpf). Across time and treatment, there were six genes (dhx40, cfap70, dnajb9b, slc35f4, spi-c, and gpr19) that were significantly up-regulated in KO compared to WT and four genes (fhad1, cyp4v7, nlrp12, and slc16a6a) that were significantly down-regulated. None of these genes have been previously identified as targets of Nfe2 or the Nrf family. These results demonstrate that the zebrafish Nfe2 may be a regulator of both primitive erythropoiesis and the OSR during development.	2016-11	2024-03-06 19:52:54	2024-03-06T19:52:54Z		141-154			180		Aquat Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27716579 PMCID: PMC5274700					5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Diquat; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Larva; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nfe2; Nrf; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; RNA-Seq; Reactive Oxygen Species; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; development; oxidative stress; zebrafish

Endoplasmic Reticulum Lipid Flux Influences Enterocyte Nuclear Morphology and Lipid-dependent Transcriptional Responses	The Journal of Biological Chemistry		1083-351X	10.1074/jbc.M116.749358		Responding to a high-fat meal requires an interplay between multiple digestive tissues, sympathetic response pathways, and the gut microbiome. The epithelial enterocytes of the intestine are responsible for absorbing dietary nutrients and preparing them for circulation to distal tissues, which requires significant changes in cellular activity, including both morphological and transcriptional responses. Following a high-fat meal, we observe morphological changes in the enterocytes of larval zebrafish, including elongation of mitochondria, formation and expansion of lipid droplets, and the rapid and transient ruffling of the nuclear periphery. Dietary and pharmacological manipulation of zebrafish larvae demonstrated that these subcellular changes are specific to triglyceride absorption. The transcriptional changes that occur simultaneously with these morphological changes were determined using RNA sequencing, revealing a cohort of up-regulated genes associated with lipid droplet formation and lipid transport via lipoprotein particles. Using a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor to block β-lipoprotein particle formation, we demonstrate that the transcriptional response to a high-fat meal is associated with the transfer of ER triglyceride to nascent β-lipoproteins, possibly through the activation of Creb3l3/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein. These data suggest that a transient increase in ER lipids is the likely mediator of the initial physiological response of intestinal enterocytes to dietary lipid.	2016-11-04	2024-03-06 19:52:53	2024-03-06T19:52:53Z		23804-23816		45	291		J Biol Chem								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27655916 PMCID: PMC5095432					Animals; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Diet, High-Fat; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Enterocytes; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Mitochondria; Transcriptional Activation; Triglycerides; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; apoA-IV; creb3l3; enterocyte; intestine; lipid droplet; lipoprotein; mitochondria; nucleus; plin2

Selenoprotein H (SepH) is a recently identified nucleolar oxidoreductase whose function is not well understood. Here we report that seph is an essential gene regulating organ development in zebrafish. Metabolite profiling by targeted LC-MS/MS demonstrated that SepH deficiency impairs redox balance by reducing the levels of ascorbate and methionine, while increasing methionine sulfoxide. Transcriptome analysis revealed that SepH deficiency induces an inflammatory response and activates the p53 pathway. Consequently, loss of seph renders larvae susceptible to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that seph interacts with p53 deficiency in adulthood to accelerate gastrointestinal tumor development. Overall, our findings establish that seph regulates redox homeostasis and suppresses DNA damage. We hypothesize that SepH deficiency may contribute to the increased cancer risk observed in cohorts with low selenium levels.	2016-09-20	2024-03-06 19:52:53	2024-03-06T19:52:53Z		E5562-5571		38	113		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27588899 PMCID: PMC5035897					Animals; Carcinogenesis; DNA Damage; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Selenium; Selenoproteins; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; endoderm development; liver cancer; p53; selenium; selenoproteins

Transcriptomic Approaches in the Zebrafish Model for Tuberculosis-Insights Into Host- and Pathogen-specific Determinants of the Innate Immune Response	Advances in Genetics		0065-2660	10.1016/bs.adgen.2016.04.004		Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish has become a well-established model of tuberculosis. Both embryonic and adult zebrafish infection studies have contributed to our knowledge of the development and function of tuberculous granulomas, which are typical of mycobacterial pathogenesis. In this review we discuss how transcriptome profiling studies have helped to characterize this infection process. We illustrate this using new RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data that reveals three main phases in the host response to M. marinum during the early stages of granuloma development in zebrafish embryos and larvae. The early phase shows induction of complement and transcription factors, followed by a relatively minor induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines within hours following phagocytosis of M. marinum. A minimal response is observed in the mid-phase, between 6 hours and 1day post infection, when the tissue dissemination of M. marinum begins. During subsequent larval development the granulomas expand and a late-phase response is apparent, which is characterized by progressively increasing induction of complement, transcription factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and other defense and inflammation-related gene groups. This late-phase response shares common components with the strong and acute host transcriptome response that has previously been reported for Salmonella typhimurium infection in zebrafish embryos. In contrast, the early/mid-phase response to M. marinum infection, characterized by suppressed pro-inflammatory signaling, is strikingly different from the acute response to S. typhimurium infection. Furthermore, M. marinum infection shows a collective and strongly fluctuating regulation of lipoproteins, while S. typhimurium infection has pronounced effects on amino acid metabolism and glycolysis.	2016	2024-03-06 19:52:52	2024-03-06T19:52:52Z		217-251			95		Adv Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27503359					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Granuloma; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Infection; Inflammation; Innate immunity; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; RNA-Seq; Salmonella; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish

Aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with abnormal cardiac cell differentiation and dysfunction. Tbx5 is a member of the T-box gene family, which acts as transcription factor involved in the vertebrate heart development. Alteration of Tbx5 level affects the expression of hundreds of genes. Haploinsufficiency and gene duplication of Tbx5 are at the basis of the cardiac abnormalities associated with Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS). Recent data indicate that miRNAs might be an important part of the regulatory circuit through which Tbx5 controls heart development. Using high-throughput technologies, we characterized genome-widely the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in WT- and Tbx5-depleted zebrafish embryos at two crucial developmental time points, 24 and 48 h post fertilization (hpf). We found that several miRNAs, which are potential effectors of Tbx5, are differentially expressed; some of them are already known to be involved in cardiac development and functions, such as miR-30, miR-34, miR-190, and miR-21. We performed an integrated analysis of miRNA expression data with gene expression profiles to refine computational target prediction approaches by means of the inversely correlation of miRNA-mRNA expressions, and we highlighted targets, which have roles in cardiac contractility, cardiomyocyte proliferation/apoptosis, and morphogenesis, crucial functions regulated by Tbx5. This approach allowed to discover complex regulatory circuits involving novel miRNAs and protein coding genes not considered before in the HOS such as miR-34a and miR-30 and their targets.	2016	2024-03-06 19:52:52	2024-03-06T19:52:52Z		60			4		Front Bioeng Biotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27471727 PMCID: PMC4943955					Holt–Oram; NGS; data integration; heart; microRNA; microarray; zebrafish

Expression profiling identifies Sertoli and Leydig cell genes as Fsh targets in adult zebrafish testis	Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology		1872-8057	10.1016/j.mce.2016.08.033		Spermatogonial stem cells are quiescent, undergo self-renewal or differentiating divisions, thereby forming the cellular basis of spermatogenesis. This cellular development is orchestrated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), through the production of Sertoli cell-derived factors, and by Leydig cell-released androgens. Here, we investigate the transcriptional events induced by Fsh in a steroid-independent manner on the restart of zebrafish (Danio rerio) spermatogenesis ex vivo, using testis from adult males where type A spermatogonia were enriched by estrogen treatment in vivo. Under these conditions, RNA sequencing preferentially detected differentially expressed genes in somatic/Sertoli cells. Fsh-stimulated spermatogonial proliferation was accompanied by modulating several signaling systems (i.e. Tgf-β, Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch pathways). In silico protein-protein interaction analysis indicated a role for Hedgehog family members potentially integrating signals from different pathways during fish spermatogenesis. Moreover, Fsh had a marked impact on metabolic genes, such as lactate and fatty acid metabolism, or on Sertoli cell barrier components. Fish Leydig cells express the Fsh receptor and one of the most robust Fsh-responsive genes was insulin-like 3 (insl3), a Leydig cell-derived growth factor. Follow-up work showed that recombinant zebrafish Insl3 mediated pro-differentiation effects of Fsh on spermatogonia in an androgen-independent manner. Our experimental approach allowed focusing on testicular somatic genes in zebrafish and showed that the activity of signaling systems known to be relevant in stem cells was modulated by Fsh, providing promising leads for future work, as exemplified by the studies on Insl3.	2016-12-05	2024-03-06 19:52:52	2024-03-06T19:52:52Z		237-251			437		Mol Cell Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27566230					Aging; Androgens; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Follicle-stimulating hormone; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Leydig Cells; Male; Protein Interaction Maps; RNA sequencing; RNA, Messenger; Recombinant Proteins; Sertoli Cells; Signal Transduction; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Testis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

One salient feature of E. tarda is the ability to survive and replicate in various host cells. In this study, we observed that E. tarda replicated robustly in the zebrafish cell line ZF4, and that E. tarda-infected cells exhibited no detectable signs of apoptosis. Global transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that E. tarda infection generally significantly downregulated pro-apoptotic genes and upregulated anti-apoptotic genes. To investigate the role of apoptosis in E. tarda infection, two upregulated anti-apoptotic genes (Fech and Prx3) and two downregulated pro-apoptotic genes (Brms1a and Ivns1a) were overexpressed in zebrafish. Subsequent infection study showed that Fech and Prx3 overexpression significantly promoted E. tarda dissemination in and colonization of fish tissues, while Brms1a and Ivns1a overexpression significantly reduced E. tarda dissemination and colonization. Consistently, when Fech and Prx3 were knocked down in zebrafish, E. tarda infection was significantly inhibited, whereas Brms1a and Ivns1a knockdown significantly enhanced E. tarda infection. These results indicate for the first time that E. tarda prevents apoptosis in teleost as a strategy for intracellular survival, and that some putative apoptotic genes of teleost function in the apoptosis pathway probably in a manner similar to that in mammalian systems.	2016	2024-03-06 19:52:51	2024-03-06T19:52:51Z		76			6		Front Cell Infect Microbiol	Edwardsiella tarda-Induced Inhibition of Apoptosis							eng					PubMed		PMID: 27471679 PMCID: PMC4943942					Animals; Antibodies; Apoptosis; Caspase 3; Cell Line; Cytoplasm; Down-Regulation; Edwardsiella tarda; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Fish Diseases; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Rats; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; apoptosis; intracellular replication; invasion; zebrafish

Cortisol-treated zebrafish embryos develop into pro-inflammatory adults with aberrant immune gene regulation	Biology Open		2046-6390	10.1242/bio.020065		Chronic early-life stress increases adult susceptibility to numerous health problems linked to chronic inflammation. One way that this may occur is via glucocorticoid-induced developmental programming. To gain insight into such programming we treated zebrafish embryos with cortisol and examined the effects on both larvae and adults. Treated larvae had elevated whole-body cortisol and glucocorticoid signaling, and upregulated genes associated with defense response and immune system processes. In adulthood the treated fish maintained elevated basal cortisol levels in the absence of exogenous cortisol, and constitutively mis-expressed genes involved in defense response and its regulation. Adults derived from cortisol-treated embryos displayed defective tailfin regeneration, heightened basal expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and failure to appropriately regulate those genes following injury or immunological challenge. These results support the hypothesis that chronically elevated glucocorticoid signaling early in life directs development of a pro-inflammatory adult phenotype, at the expense of immunoregulation and somatic regenerative capacity.	2016-08-15	2024-03-06 19:52:51	2024-03-06T19:52:51Z		1134-1141		8	5		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27444789 PMCID: PMC5004618					Chronic stress; Developmental programming; Glucocorticoid; Immune system; RNA-seq; Zebrafish

The lower temperature limit (LTL), namely the lower end of survival temperature, is an important trait delimiting the geographical distribution of a species, however, the genetic mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the inter-species transcriptional diversification in cold responses between zebrafish Danio rerio and tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, which were reared at a common temperature (28 °C) but have distinct LTLs. We identified significant expressional divergence between the two species in the orthologous genes from gills when the temperature cooled to the LTL of tilapia (8 °C). Five KEGG pathways were found sequentially over-represented in the zebrafish/tilapia divergently expressed genes in the duration (12 hour) of 8 °C exposure, forming a signaling cascade from metabolic regulation to apoptosis via FoxO signaling. Consistently, we found differential progression of apoptosis in the gills of the two species in which zebrafish manifested a delayed and milder apoptotic phenotype than tilapia, corresponding with a lower LTL of zebrafish. We identified diverged expression in 25 apoptosis-related transcription factors between the two species which forms an interacting network with diverged factors involving the FoxO signaling and metabolic regulation. We propose a genetic network which regulates LTL in fishes.	2016-06-30	2024-03-06 19:52:50	2024-03-06T19:52:50Z		28952			6		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27356472 PMCID: PMC4928090					Animals; Apoptosis; Cold Temperature; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Stress, Physiological; Tilapia; Zebrafish

R.	Cloche is a bHLH-PAS transcription factor that drives haemato-vascular specification	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature18614		Vascular and haematopoietic cells organize into specialized tissues during early embryogenesis to supply essential nutrients to all organs and thus play critical roles in development and disease. At the top of the haemato-vascular specification cascade lies cloche, a gene that when mutated in zebrafish leads to the striking phenotype of loss of most endothelial and haematopoietic cells and a significant increase in cardiomyocyte numbers. Although this mutant has been analysed extensively to investigate mesoderm diversification and differentiation and continues to be broadly used as a unique avascular model, the isolation of the cloche gene has been challenging due to its telomeric location. Here we used a deletion allele of cloche to identify several new cloche candidate genes within this genomic region, and systematically genome-edited each candidate. Through this comprehensive interrogation, we succeeded in isolating the cloche gene and discovered that it encodes a PAS-domain-containing bHLH transcription factor, and that it is expressed in a highly specific spatiotemporal pattern starting during late gastrulation. Gain-of-function experiments show that it can potently induce endothelial gene expression. Epistasis experiments reveal that it functions upstream of etv2 and tal1, the earliest expressed endothelial and haematopoietic transcription factor genes identified to date. A mammalian cloche orthologue can also rescue blood vessel formation in zebrafish cloche mutants, indicating a highly conserved role in vertebrate vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis. The identification of this master regulator of endothelial and haematopoietic fate enhances our understanding of early mesoderm diversification and may lead to improved protocols for the generation of endothelial and haematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro.	2016-07-14	2024-03-06 19:52:50	2024-03-06T19:52:50Z		294-298		7611	535		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27411634					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Blood Cells; Blood Vessels; Cell Differentiation; Conserved Sequence; Endothelial Cells; Epistasis, Genetic; Gene Deletion; Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs; Hematopoiesis; Mesoderm; Mutation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Tbx16 regulates hox gene activation in mesodermal progenitor cells	Nature Chemical Biology		1552-4469	10.1038/nchembio.2124		The transcription factor T-box 16 (Tbx16, or Spadetail) is an essential regulator of paraxial mesoderm development in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) fail to differentiate into trunk somites in tbx16 mutants and instead accumulate within the tailbud in an immature state. However, the mechanisms by which Tbx16 controls mesoderm patterning have remained enigmatic. We describe here the use of photoactivatable morpholino oligonucleotides to determine the Tbx16 transcriptome in MPCs. We identified 124 Tbx16-regulated genes that were expressed in zebrafish gastrulae, including several developmental signaling proteins and regulators of gastrulation, myogenesis and somitogenesis. Unexpectedly, we observed that a loss of Tbx16 function precociously activated posterior hox genes in MPCs, and overexpression of a single posterior hox gene was sufficient to disrupt MPC migration. Our studies support a model in which Tbx16 regulates the timing of collinear hox gene activation to coordinate the anterior-posterior fates and positions of paraxial MPCs.	2016-09	2024-03-06 19:52:50	2024-03-06T19:52:50Z		694-701		9	12		Nat Chem Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27376691 PMCID: PMC4990471					Animals; Genes, Homeobox; Mesoderm; Molecular Structure; Stem Cells; T-Box Domain Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

We find that carriers of the risk allele have higher hepatic expression of the transcriptional repressor FOXN3. Rat Foxn3 protein and zebrafish foxn3 transcripts are downregulated during fasting, a process recapitulated in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Transgenic overexpression of zebrafish foxn3 or human FOXN3 increases zebrafish hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, whole-larval free glucose, and adult fasting blood glucose and also decreases expression of glycolytic genes. Hepatic FOXN3 overexpression suppresses expression of mycb, whose ortholog MYC is known to directly stimulate expression of glucose-utilization enzymes. Carriers of the rs8004664 risk allele have decreased MYC transcript abundance. Human FOXN3 binds DNA sequences in the human MYC and zebrafish mycb loci. We conclude that the rs8004664 risk allele drives excessive expression of FOXN3 during fasting and that FOXN3 regulates fasting blood glucose.	2016-06-21	2024-03-06 19:52:49	2024-03-06T19:52:49Z		2745-2755		12	15		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27292639 PMCID: PMC4917433					Alleles; Animals; Blood Glucose; Down-Regulation; Fasting; Glucose; Glycolysis; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver; Male; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Rats; Repressor Proteins; Risk Factors; Zebrafish

A Conserved MicroRNA Regulatory Circuit Is Differentially Controlled during Limb/Appendage Regeneration	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0157106		BACKGROUND: Although regenerative capacity is evident throughout the animal kingdom, it is not equally distributed throughout evolution. For instance, complex limb/appendage regeneration is muted in mammals but enhanced in amphibians and teleosts. The defining characteristic of limb/appendage regenerative systems is the formation of a dedifferentiated tissue, termed blastema, which serves as the progenitor reservoir for regenerating tissues. In order to identify a genetic signature that accompanies blastema formation, we employ next-generation sequencing to identify shared, differentially regulated mRNAs and noncoding RNAs in three different, highly regenerative animal systems: zebrafish caudal fins, bichir pectoral fins and axolotl forelimbs. RESULTS: These studies identified a core group of 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) that were commonly upregulated and 5 miRNAs that were commonly downregulated, as well as 4 novel tRNAs fragments with sequences conserved with humans. To understand the potential function of these miRNAs, we built a network of 1,550 commonly differentially expressed mRNAs that had functional relationships to 11 orthologous blastema-associated genes. As miR-21 was the most highly upregulated and most highly expressed miRNA in all three models, we validated the expression of known target genes, including the tumor suppressor, pdcd4, and TGFβ receptor subunit, tgfbr2 and novel putative target genes such as the anti-apoptotic factor, bcl2l13, Choline kinase alpha, chka and the regulator of G-protein signaling, rgs5. CONCLUSIONS: Our extensive analysis of RNA-seq transcriptome profiling studies in three regenerative animal models, that diverged in evolution ~420 million years ago, reveals a common miRNA-regulated genetic network of blastema genes. These comparative studies extend our current understanding of limb/appendage regeneration by identifying previously unassociated blastema genes and the extensive regulation by miRNAs, which could serve as a foundation for future functional studies to examine the process of natural cellular reprogramming in an injury context.	2016	2024-03-06 19:52:49	2024-03-06T19:52:49Z		e0157106		6	11		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27355827 PMCID: PMC4927183					Ambystoma mexicanum; Animal Fins; Animals; Extremities; Fishes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; MicroRNAs; RNA, Untranslated; Regeneration; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

To date, the mechanism by which mechanical forces coordinate tissue morphogenesis is poorly understood. Here we use high-resolution imaging to uncover the coordinated cell behaviours leading to heart valve formation. We find that heart valves originate from progenitors located in the ventricle and atrium that generate the valve leaflets through a coordinated set of endocardial tissue movements. Gene profiling analyses and live imaging reveal that this reorganization is dependent on extracellular matrix proteins, in particular on the expression of fibronectin1b. We show that blood flow and klf2a, a major endocardial flow-responsive gene, control these cell behaviours and fibronectin1b synthesis. Our results uncover a unique multicellular layering process leading to leaflet formation and demonstrate that endocardial mechanotransduction and valve morphogenesis are coupled via cellular rearrangements mediated by fibronectin synthesis.	2016-05-25	2024-03-06 19:52:49	2024-03-06T19:52:49Z		11646			7		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27221222 PMCID: PMC4894956					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Extracellular Matrix; Fibronectins; Gene Expression Profiling; Heart Valves; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The evolution of ray-finned fish was impacted by several whole genome duplication (WGD) events including a teleost-specific WGD event (TGD) that occurred at the root of the teleost lineage about 350 million years ago (Mya) and more recent WGD events in salmonids, carps, suckers and others. In plants and animals, WGD events are associated with adaptive radiations and evolutionary innovations. WGD-spurred innovation may be especially relevant in the case of teleost fish, which colonized a wide diversity of habitats on earth, including many extreme environments. Fish biodiversity, the use of fish models for human medicine and ecological studies, and the importance of fish in human nutrition, fuel an important need for the characterization of gene expression repertoires and corresponding evolutionary histories of ray-finned fish genes. To this aim, we performed transcriptome analyses and developed the PhyloFish database to provide (i) de novo assembled gene repertoires in 23 different ray-finned fish species including two holosteans (i.e. a group that diverged from teleosts before TGD) and 21 teleosts (including six salmonids), and (ii) gene expression levels in ten different tissues and organs (and embryos for many) in the same species. This resource was generated using a common deep RNA sequencing protocol to obtain the most exhaustive gene repertoire possible in each species that allows between-species comparisons to study the evolution of gene expression in different lineages. The PhyloFish database described here can be accessed and searched using RNAbrowse, a simple and efficient solution to give access to RNA-seq de novo assembled transcripts.	2016-05-18	2024-03-06 19:52:48	2024-03-06T19:52:48Z		368			17		BMC Genomics	Gene evolution and gene expression after whole genome duplication in fish							eng					PubMed		PMID: 27189481 PMCID: PMC4870732					Animals; Assembly; Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Evolution, Molecular; Fishes; Gar; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene duplication; Gene expression; Genome; Holostean; Mcam; Phylogeny; Salmonids; Stra8; Teleosts; Transcriptome; Web Browser

However, previous studies did not specifically investigate the underlying mechanisms of its developmental toxicity. Here, we chose zebrafish embryos as the model, exposed them to 2 different concentrations of PCP, and sequenced their entire transcriptomes at 10 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The sequencing analysis revealed that high concentrations of PCP elicited systematic responses at both time points. By combining the enrichment terms with single genes, the results were further analyzed using three categories: metabolism, transporters, and organogenesis. Hyperactive glycolysis was the most outstanding feature of the transcriptome at 10 hpf. The entire system seemed to be hypoxic, although hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) may have been suppressed by the upregulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). At 24 hpf, PCP primarily affected somitogenesis and lens formation probably resulting from the disruption of embryonic body plan at earlier stages. The proposed underlying toxicological mechanism of PCP was based on the crosstalk between each clue. Our study attempted to describe the developmental toxicity of environmental pollutants from a systematic view. Meanwhile, some features of gene expression profiling could serve as markers of human health or ecological risk.	2016-05-16	2024-03-06 19:52:48	2024-03-06T19:52:48Z		25929			6		Sci Rep	The developmental effects of pentachlorophenol on zebrafish embryos during segmentation							eng					PubMed		PMID: 27181905 PMCID: PMC4867433					Animals; Body Patterning; Cleavage Stage, Ovum; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Environmental Pollutants; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Glycolysis; Models, Animal; Pentachlorophenol; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Fast repair of such ruptures is the most promising therapeutic approach. Due to a lack of high-resolution in vivo real-time studies, the dynamic cellular events involved in cerebrovascular repair remain unknown. Here, we have developed a cerebrovascular rupture system in zebrafish by using multi-photon laser, which generates a lesion with two endothelial ends. In vivo time-lapse imaging showed that a macrophage arrived at the lesion and extended filopodia or lamellipodia to physically adhere to both endothelial ends. This macrophage generated mechanical traction forces to pull the endothelial ends and facilitate their ligation, thus mediating the repair of the rupture. Both depolymerization of microfilaments and inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase or Rac1 activity disrupted macrophage-endothelial adhesion and impaired cerebrovascular repair. Our study reveals a hitherto unexpected role for macrophages in mediating repair of cerebrovascular ruptures through direct physical adhesion and mechanical traction.	2016-05-17	2024-03-06 19:52:47	2024-03-06T19:52:47Z		1162-1176		5	44		Immunity								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27156384					Actin Cytoskeleton; Aneurysm, Ruptured; Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cells, Cultured; Cerebrovascular Trauma; Endothelium, Vascular; Macrophages; Mechanical Phenomena; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Traction; Vascular Remodeling; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein

We performed a longitudinal study in the short-lived killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, and correlated quantitative variations in gene expression during early adult life with lifespan. Shorter- and longer-lived individuals differ in their gene expression before the onset of aging-related mortality; differences in gene expression are more pronounced early in life. We identified mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I as a hub in a module of genes whose expression is negatively correlated with lifespan. Accordingly, partial pharmacological inhibition of complex I by the small molecule rotenone reversed aging-related regulation of gene expression and extended lifespan in N. furzeri by 15%. These results support the use of N. furzeri as a vertebrate model for identifying the protein targets, pharmacological modulators, and individual-to-individual variability associated with aging.	2016-02-24	2024-03-06 19:52:47	2024-03-06T19:52:47Z		122-132		2	2		Cell Syst								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27135165					Animals; Cyprinodontiformes; GAGE; Longitudinal Studies; Nothobranchius furzeri; RNA; RNA transport; RNA-seq; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Vertebrates; aging; history trait; hormesis; hourglass; life ribosome; lifespan regulation; longevity; longitudinal study; mitohormesis; rejuvenation; weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA); zebrafish

Biliatresone has selective toxicity for extrahepatic cholangiocytes (EHCs) in zebrafish larvae. To better understand its mechanism of toxicity, we performed transcriptional profiling of liver cells isolated from zebrafish larvae at the earliest stage of biliatresone-mediated biliary injury, with subsequent comparison of biliary and hepatocyte gene expression profiles. Transcripts encoded by genes involved in redox stress response, particularly those involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism, were among the most prominently up-regulated in both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes of biliatresone-treated larvae. Consistent with these findings, hepatic GSH was depleted at the onset of biliary injury, and in situ mapping of the hepatic GSH redox potential using a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein biosensor showed that it was significantly more oxidized in EHCs both before and after treatment with biliatresone. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of GSH redox homeostasis confirmed the importance of GSH in modulating biliatresone-induced injury given that GSH depletion sensitized both EHCs and the otherwise resistant intrahepatic cholangiocytes to the toxin, whereas replenishing GSH level by N-acetylcysteine administration or activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional regulator of GSH synthesis, inhibited EHC injury. CONCLUSION: These findings strongly support redox stress as a critical contributing factor in biliatresone-induced cholangiocyte injury, and suggest that variations in intrinsic stress responses underlie the susceptibility profile. Insufficient antioxidant capacity of EHCs may be critical to early pathogenesis of human BA.

Using primordial germ cells that participate in gonad formation, we present the developmental mechanisms maintaining a motile progenitor cell population at the site where the organ develops. Employing high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we find that repulsive cues coupled with physical barriers confine the cells to the correct bilateral positions. This analysis revealed that cell polarity changes on interaction with the physical barrier and that the establishment of compact clusters involves increased cell-cell interaction time. Using particle-based simulations, we demonstrate the role of reflecting barriers, from which cells turn away on contact, and the importance of proper cell-cell adhesion level for maintaining the tight cell clusters and their correct positioning at the target region. The combination of these developmental and cellular mechanisms prevents organ fusion, controls organ positioning and is thus critical for its proper function.	2016-04-18	2024-03-06 19:51:55	2024-03-06T19:51:55Z		11288			7		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27088892 PMCID: PMC4837475					Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Adhesion; Cell Movement; Digestive System; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Stem Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gonads; Metalloproteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Molecular Sequence Data; Organogenesis; Phylogeny; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Time-Lapse Imaging; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

While much has been learned about the signaling pathways and transcription factors that control facial patterning, the downstream cellular mechanisms dictating skeletal shapes have remained unclear. Here we present genetic evidence in zebrafish that three major signaling pathways - Jagged-Notch, Endothelin1 (Edn1), and Bmp - regulate the pattern of facial cartilage and bone formation by controlling the timing of cartilage differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the pharyngeal arches. A genomic analysis of purified facial skeletal precursors in mutant and overexpression embryos revealed a core set of differentiation genes that were commonly repressed by Jagged-Notch and induced by Edn1. Further analysis of the pre-cartilage condensation gene barx1, as well as in vivo imaging of cartilage differentiation, revealed that cartilage forms first in regions of high Edn1 and low Jagged-Notch activity. Consistent with a role of Jagged-Notch signaling in restricting cartilage differentiation, loss of Notch pathway components resulted in expanded barx1 expression in the dorsal arches, with mutation of barx1 rescuing some aspects of dorsal skeletal patterning in jag1b mutants. We also identified prrx1a and prrx1b as negative Edn1 and positive Bmp targets that function in parallel to Jagged-Notch signaling to restrict the formation of dorsal barx1+ pre-cartilage condensations. Simultaneous loss of jag1b and prrx1a/b better rescued lower facial defects of edn1 mutants than loss of either pathway alone, showing that combined overactivation of Jagged-Notch and Bmp/Prrx1 pathways contribute to the absence of cartilage differentiation in the edn1 mutant lower face. These findings support a model in which Notch-mediated restriction of cartilage differentiation, particularly in the second pharyngeal arch, helps to establish a distinct skeletal pattern in the upper face.	2016-04	2024-03-06 19:51:55	2024-03-06T19:51:55Z		e1005967		4	12		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27058748 PMCID: PMC4825933					Animals; Cartilage; Face; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Modulation of tissue repair by regeneration enhancer elements	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature17644		How tissue regeneration programs are triggered by injury has received limited research attention. Here we investigate the existence of enhancer regulatory elements that are activated in regenerating tissue. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that leptin b (lepb) is highly induced in regenerating hearts and fins of zebrafish. Epigenetic profiling identified a short DNA sequence element upstream and distal to lepb that acquires open chromatin marks during regeneration and enables injury-dependent expression from minimal promoters. This element could activate expression in injured neonatal mouse tissues and was divisible into tissue-specific modules sufficient for expression in regenerating zebrafish fins or hearts. Simple enhancer-effector transgenes employing lepb-linked sequences upstream of pro- or anti-regenerative factors controlled the efficacy of regeneration in zebrafish. Our findings provide evidence for 'tissue regeneration enhancer elements' (TREEs) that trigger gene expression in injury sites and can be engineered to modulate the regenerative potential of vertebrate organs.	2016-04-14	2024-03-06 19:51:55	2024-03-06T19:51:55Z		201-206		7598	532		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27049946 PMCID: PMC4844022					Acetylation; Animal Fins; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart; Histones; Leptin; Lysine; Male; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organ Specificity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regeneration; Transgenes; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis. A majority of their alveolar macrophages exhibit lysosomal accumulations of tobacco smoke particulates and do not migrate to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The incapacitation of highly microbicidal first-responding macrophages may contribute to smokers' susceptibility to tuberculosis.	2016-03-24	2024-03-06 19:51:54	2024-03-06T19:51:54Z		139-152		1	165		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27015311 PMCID: PMC4819607					Animals; Disease Susceptibility; Granuloma; Lysosomes; Macrophages; Macrophages, Alveolar; Mycobacterium Infections; Mycobacterium marinum; Pulmonary Alveoli; Smoking; Transcription Factors; Transport Vesicles; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In metazoans, the earliest stages of development are driven by maternally supplied mRNAs. The degradation of these maternal mRNAs is critical for promoting the maternal-to-zygotic transition of developmental programs, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood in vertebrates. Here, we characterized maternal mRNA degradation pathways in zebrafish using a transcriptome analysis and systematic reporter assays. Our data demonstrate that ORFs enriched with uncommon codons promote deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT complex in a translation-dependent manner. This codon-mediated mRNA decay is conditional on the context of the 3' UTR, with long 3' UTRs conferring resistance to deadenylation. These results indicate that the combined effect of codon usage and 3' UTR length determines the stability of maternal mRNAs in zebrafish embryos. Our study thus highlights the codon-mediated mRNA decay as a conserved regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes.	2016-03-17	2024-03-06 19:51:54	2024-03-06T19:51:54Z		874-885		6	61		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26990990					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Codon; Gene Expression Regulation; Maternal-Fetal Relations; Multiprotein Complexes; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zygote

The clinical phenotypes of DBA include failure of erythropoiesis, congenital anomalies and cancer predisposition. Mutations in RPL5 are reported in approximately 9 ~ 21 % of DBA patients, which represents the most common pathological condition related to a large-subunit ribosomal protein. However, it remains unclear how RPL5 downregulation results in severe phenotypes of this disease. RESULTS: In this study, we generated a zebrafish model of DBA with RPL5 morphants and implemented high-throughput RNA-seq and ncRNA-seq to identify key genes, lncRNAs, and miRNAs during zebrafish development and hematopoiesis. We demonstrated that RPL5 is required for both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis processes. By comparing with other DBA zebrafish models and processing functional coupling network, we identified some common regulated genes, lncRNAs and miRNAs, that might play important roles in development and hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: Ribosome biogenesis and translation process were affected more in RPL5 MO than in other RP MOs. Both P53 dependent (for example, cell cycle pathway) and independent pathways (such as Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway) play important roles in DBA pathology. Our results therefore provide a comprehensive basis for the study of molecular pathogenesis of RPL5-mediated DBA and other ribosomopathies.	2016-03-09	2024-03-06 19:51:54	2024-03-06T19:51:54Z		13			9		BMC Med Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26961822 PMCID: PMC4785739					Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Down-Regulation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoiesis; Hemoglobins; MicroRNAs; Morpholinos; RNA, Long Noncoding; Ribosomes; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the mechanisms that guide the epigenome through this transition and their evolutionary conservation remain elusive. Here we report widespread DNA demethylation of enhancers during the phylotypic period in zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis and mouse. These enhancers are linked to developmental genes that display coordinated transcriptional and epigenomic changes in the diverse vertebrates during embryogenesis. Binding of Tet proteins to (hydroxy)methylated DNA and enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in these regions implicated active DNA demethylation in this process. Furthermore, loss of function of Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3 in zebrafish reduced chromatin accessibility and increased methylation levels specifically at these enhancers, indicative of DNA methylation being an upstream regulator of phylotypic enhancer function. Overall, our study highlights a regulatory module associated with the most conserved phase of vertebrate embryogenesis and suggests an ancient developmental role for Tet dioxygenases.	2016-04	2024-03-06 19:51:54	2024-03-06T19:51:54Z		417-426		4	48		Nat Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26928226 PMCID: PMC5912259					Animals; Body Patterning; DNA Methylation; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mice; Xenopus; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Morphological and molecular analyses have revealed that a stage in the middle of development--known as the phylotypic period--is conserved among species within some phyla. Although these analyses provide evidence for their existence, phyla have also been criticized as lacking an objective definition, and consequently based on arbitrary groupings of animals. Here we compare the developmental transcriptomes of ten species, each annotated to a different phylum, with a wide range of life histories and embryonic forms. We find that in all ten species, development comprises the coupling of early and late phases of conserved gene expression. These phases are linked by a divergent 'mid-developmental transition' that uses species-specific suites of signalling pathways and transcription factors. This mid-developmental transition overlaps with the phylotypic period that has been defined previously for three of the ten phyla, suggesting that transcriptional circuits and signalling mechanisms active during this transition are crucial for defining the phyletic body plan and that the mid-developmental transition may be used to define phylotypic periods in other phyla. Placing these observations alongside the reported conservation of mid-development within phyla, we propose that a phylum may be defined as a collection of species whose gene expression at the mid-developmental transition is both highly conserved among them, yet divergent relative to other species.	2016-03-31	2024-03-06 19:51:53	2024-03-06T19:51:53Z		637-641		7596	531		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26886793 PMCID: PMC4817236					Animals; Body Patterning; Conserved Sequence; Embryonic Development; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Developmental; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Transcriptome

Transcriptome Analysis of Chemically-Induced Sensory Neuron Ablation in Zebrafish	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0148726		Peripheral glia are known to have a critical role in the initial response to axon damage and degeneration. However, little is known about the cellular responses of non-myelinating glia to nerve injury. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of wild-type and mutant (lacking peripheral glia) zebrafish larvae that were treated with metronidazole. This treatment allowed us to conditionally and selectively ablate cranial sensory neurons whose axons are ensheathed only by non-myelinating glia. While transcripts representing over 27,000 genes were detected by RNAseq, only a small fraction (~1% of genes) were found to be differentially expressed in response to neuronal degeneration in either line at either 2 hrs or 5 hrs of metronidazole treatment. Analysis revealed that most expression changes (332 out of the total of 458 differentially expressed genes) occurred over a continuous period (from 2 to 5 hrs of metronidazole exposure), with a small number of genes showing changes limited to only the 2 hr (55 genes) or 5 hr (71 genes) time points. For genes with continuous alterations in expression, some of the most meaningful sets of enriched categories in the wild-type line were those involving the inflammatory TNF-alpha and IL6 signaling pathways, oxidoreductase activities and response to stress. Intriguingly, these changes were not observed in the mutant line. Indeed, cluster analysis indicated that the effects of metronidazole treatment on gene expression was heavily influenced by the presence or absence of glia, indicating that the peripheral non-myelinating glia play a significant role in the transcriptional response to sensory neuron degeneration. This is the first transcriptome study of metronidazole-induced neuronal death in zebrafish and the response of non-myelinating glia to sensory neuron degeneration. We believe this study provides important insight into the mechanisms by which non-myelinating glia react to neuronal death and degeneration in sensory circuits.	2016	2024-03-06 19:51:53	2024-03-06T19:51:53Z		e0148726		2	11		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26863206 PMCID: PMC4749159					Animals; Cytokines; Denervation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Larva; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metronidazole; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurogenesis; Oxidoreductases; RNA, Messenger; Sensory Receptor Cells; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In contrast, the zebrafish heart retains a robust capacity for regeneration into adulthood. These distinct responses are consequences of a differential utilization of evolutionary-conserved gene regulatory networks in the damaged heart. To systematically identify miRNA-dependent networks controlling cardiac repair following injury, we performed comparative gene and miRNA profiling of the cardiac transcriptome in adult mice and zebrafish. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using an integrated approach, we show that 45 miRNA-dependent networks, involved in critical biological pathways, are differentially modulated in the injured zebrafish vs. mouse hearts. We study, more particularly, the miR-26a-dependent response. Therefore, miR-26a is down-regulated in the fish heart after injury, whereas its expression remains constant in the mouse heart. Targets of miR-26a involve activators of the cell cycle and Ezh2, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Importantly, PRC2 exerts repressive functions on negative regulators of the cell cycle. In cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, inhibition of miR-26a stimulates, therefore, cardiomyocyte proliferation. Accordingly, miR-26a knockdown prolongs the proliferative window of cardiomyocytes in the post-natal mouse heart. CONCLUSIONS: This novel strategy identifies a series of miRNAs and associated pathways, in particular miR-26a, which represent attractive therapeutic targets for inducing repair in the injured heart.	2016-05-01	2024-03-06 19:51:52	2024-03-06T19:51:52Z		73-84		1	110		Cardiovasc Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26857418 PMCID: PMC4798047					Animals; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MicroRNAs; Mouse; Myocardial infarction; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Repair mechanisms; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; miRNAs

A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aad2197		The "cancerized field" concept posits that cancer-prone cells in a given tissue share an oncogenic mutation, but only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. Most benign nevi carry oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutations but rarely become melanoma. The zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (NCPs) and specifically reexpressed in melanoma. Live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters shows that within a cancerized field (BRAF(V600E)-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the NCP state, revealing a fate change at melanoma initiation in this model. NCP transcription factors, including sox10, regulate crestin expression. Forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, which is consistent with activation of NCP genes and super-enhancers leading to melanoma. Our work highlights NCP state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation.	2016-01-29	2024-03-06 19:51:52	2024-03-06T19:51:52Z		aad2197		6272	351		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26823433 PMCID: PMC4868069					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carcinogenesis; Embryonic Stem Cells; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Melanoma, Experimental; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Crest; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; SOXE Transcription Factors; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
A53YBP55	journalArticle	2016	Lisse, Thomas S.; King, Benjamin L.; Rieger, Sandra	Comparative transcriptomic profiling of hydrogen peroxide signaling networks in zebrafish and human keratinocytes: Implications toward conservation, migration and wound healing	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/srep20328		Skin wounds need to be repaired rapidly after injury to restore proper skin barrier function. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a conserved signaling factor that has been shown to promote a variety of skin wound repair processes, including immune cell migration, angiogenesis and sensory axon repair. Despite growing research on H2O2 functions in wound repair, the downstream signaling pathways activated by this reactive oxygen species in the context of injury remain largely unknown. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes in the epidermis upon exposure to H2O2 concentrations known to promote wound repair. Comparative transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq data from larval zebrafish and previously reported microarray data from a human epidermal keratinocyte line shows that H2O2 activates conserved cell migration, adhesion, cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic programs in both zebrafish and human keratinocytes. Further assessment of expression characteristics and signaling pathways revealed the activation of three major H2O2-dependent pathways, EGF, FOXO1, and IKKα. This study expands on our current understanding of the clinical potential of low-level H2O2 for the promotion of epidermal wound repair and provides potential candidates in the treatment of wound healing deficits.	2016-02-05	2024-03-06 19:51:52	2024-03-06T19:51:52Z		20328			6		Sci Rep	Comparative transcriptomic profiling of hydrogen peroxide signaling networks in zebrafish and human keratinocytes							eng					PubMed		PMID: 26846883 PMCID: PMC4742856					Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line; Cell Movement; Down-Regulation; Epidermal Growth Factor; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Keratinocytes; Larva; NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Wound Healing; Zebrafish

Epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis by DNA methylation	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.11813		During embryonic development, cell type-specific transcription factors promote cell identities, while epigenetic modifications are thought to contribute to maintain these cell fates. Our understanding of how genetic and epigenetic modes of regulation work together to establish and maintain cellular identity is still limited, however. Here, we show that DNA methyltransferase 3bb.1 (dnmt3bb.1) is essential for maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fate as part of an early Notch-runx1-cmyb HSPC specification pathway in the zebrafish. Dnmt3bb.1 is expressed in HSPC downstream from Notch1 and runx1, and loss of Dnmt3bb.1 activity leads to reduced cmyb locus methylation, reduced cmyb expression, and gradual reduction in HSPCs. Ectopic overexpression of dnmt3bb.1 in non-hematopoietic cells is sufficient to methylate the cmyb locus, promote cmyb expression, and promote hematopoietic development. Our results reveal an epigenetic mechanism supporting the maintenance of hematopoietic cell fate via DNA methylation-mediated perdurance of a key transcription factor in HSPCs.	2016-01-27	2024-03-06 19:51:51	2024-03-06T19:51:51Z		e11813			5		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26814702 PMCID: PMC4744183					Animals; Cell Fate maintenance; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetics; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Loci; Hematopoiesis; Methyltransferases; Zebrafish; developmental biology; stem cells; zebrafish

Phenotypic chemical screening using a zebrafish neural crest EMT reporter identifies retinoic acid as an inhibitor of epithelial morphogenesis	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.021790		The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly conserved morphogenetic program essential for embryogenesis, regeneration and cancer metastasis. In cancer cells, EMT also triggers cellular reprogramming and chemoresistance, which underlie disease relapse and decreased survival. Hence, identifying compounds that block EMT is essential to prevent or eradicate disseminated tumor cells. Here, we establish a whole-animal-based EMT reporter in zebrafish for rapid drug screening, calledTg(snai1b:GFP), which labels epithelial cells undergoing EMT to producesox10-positive neural crest (NC) cells. Time-lapse and lineage analysis ofTg(snai1b:GFP)embryos reveal that cranial NC cells delaminate from two regions: an early population delaminates adjacent to the neural plate, whereas a later population delaminates from within the dorsal neural tube. TreatingTg(snai1b:GFP)embryos with candidate small-molecule EMT-inhibiting compounds identified TP-0903, a multi-kinase inhibitor that blocked cranial NC cell delamination in both the lateral and medial populations. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and chemical rescue experiments show that TP-0903 acts through stimulating retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis and RA-dependent transcription. These studies identify TP-0903 as a new therapeutic for activating RAin vivoand raise the possibility that RA-dependent inhibition of EMT contributes to its prior success in eliminating disseminated cancer cells.	2016-04	2024-03-06 19:51:51	2024-03-06T19:51:51Z		389-400		4	9		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26794130 PMCID: PMC4852498					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Shape; Drug screen; EMT; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial mesenchymal; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Morphogenesis; Neural Crest; Neural Tube; Neural crest; Phenotype; Pyrimidines; Retinoic acid; Signal Transduction; Sulfonamides; Transcription, Genetic; Tretinoin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

To identify regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, we used spatially resolved RNA sequencing (tomo-seq) and generated a high-resolution genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the regenerating zebrafish heart. Interestingly, we identified two wound border zones with distinct expression profiles, including the re-expression of embryonic cardiac genes and targets of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Endogenous BMP signaling has been reported to be detrimental to mammalian cardiac repair. In contrast, we find that genetic or chemical inhibition of BMP signaling in zebrafish reduces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation, ultimately compromising myocardial regeneration, while bmp2b overexpression is sufficient to enhance it. Our results provide a resource for further studies on the molecular regulation of cardiac regeneration and reveal intriguing differential cellular responses of cardiomyocytes to a conserved signaling pathway in regenerative versus non-regenerative hearts.	2016-01-11	2024-03-06 19:51:51	2024-03-06T19:51:51Z		36-49		1	36		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26748692					Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Conserved and highly expressed tRNA derived fragments in zebrafish	BMC molecular biology		1471-2199	10.1186/s12867-015-0050-8		BACKGROUND: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) are a class of transcripts implicated in several eukaryotic regulatory mechanisms, namely gene silencing and chromatin regulation. Despite significant progress in their identification by next generation sequencing (NGS) we are still far from understanding their full diversity and functional repertoire. RESULTS: Here we report the identification of tRNA derived fragments (tRFs) by NGS of the sncRNA fraction of zebrafish. The tRFs identified are 18-30 nt long, are derived from specific 5' and 3' processing of mature tRNAs and are differentially expressed during development and in differentiated tissues, suggesting that they are likely produced by specific processing rather than random degradation of tRNAs. We further show that a highly expressed tRF (5'tRF-Pro(CGG)) is cleaved in vitro by Dicer and has silencing ability, indicating that it can enter the RNAi pathway. A computational analysis of zebrafish tRFs shows that they are conserved among vertebrates and mining of publicly available datasets reveals that some 5'tRFs are differentially expressed in disease conditions, namely during infection and colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: tRFs constitute a class of conserved regulatory RNAs in vertebrates and may be involved in mechanisms of genome regulation and in some diseases.	2015-12-22	2024-03-06 19:51:50	2024-03-06T19:51:50Z		22			16		BMC Mol Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26694924 PMCID: PMC4688932					Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Colorectal Neoplasms; Conserved Sequence; Gene Expression Regulation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Untranslated; RNA, Transfer; Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid; Ribonuclease III; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Single epicardial cell transcriptome sequencing identifies Caveolin 1 as an essential factor in zebrafish heart regeneration	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.130534		In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish have a high capacity to regenerate damaged or lost myocardium through proliferation of cardiomyocytes spared from damage. The epicardial sheet covering the heart is activated by injury and aids muscle regeneration through paracrine effects and as a multipotent cell source, and has received recent attention as a target in cardiac repair strategies. Although it is recognized that epicardium is required for muscle regeneration and itself has high regenerative potential, the extent of cellular heterogeneity within epicardial tissue is largely unexplored. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis on dozens of epicardial lineage cells purified from zebrafish harboring a transgenic reporter for the pan-epicardial gene tcf21. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested the presence of at least three epicardial cell subsets defined by expression signatures. We validated many new pan-epicardial and epicardial markers by alternative expression assays. Additionally, we explored the function of the scaffolding protein and main component of caveolae, caveolin 1 (cav1), which was present in each epicardial subset. In BAC transgenic zebrafish, cav1 regulatory sequences drove strong expression in ostensibly all epicardial cells and in coronary vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, cav1 mutant zebrafish generated by genome editing showed grossly normal heart development and adult cardiac anatomy, but displayed profound defects in injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. Our study defines a new platform for the discovery of epicardial lineage markers, genetic tools, and mechanisms of heart regeneration.	2016-01-15	2024-03-06 19:51:50	2024-03-06T19:51:50Z		232-243		2	143		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26657776 PMCID: PMC4725347					Animals; Caveolin 1; Caveolin-1; Epicardium; Heart; Heart regeneration; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pericardium; Regeneration; Single-cell sequencing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here we show that, in zebrafish, modulation of a single miRNA is sufficient to rescue the morphogenetic defects generated by HOS. The analysis of miRNA-seq profiling revealed a decreased expression of miR-19a in Tbx5-depleted zebrafish embryos compared to the wild type. We revealed that the transcription of the miR-17-92 cluster, which harbors miR-19a, is induced by Tbx5 and that a defined dosage of miR-19a is essential for the correct development of the heart. Importantly, we highlighted that miR-19a replacement is able to rescue cardiac and pectoral fin defects and to increase the viability of HOS zebrafish embryos. We further observed that miR-19a replacement shifts the global gene expression profile of HOS-like zebrafish embryos towards the wild type condition, confirming the ability of miR-19a to rescue the Tbx5 phenotype. In conclusion our data demonstrate the importance of Tbx5/miR-19a regulatory circuit in heart development and provide a proof of principle that morphogenetic defects associated with HOS can be rescued by transient miRNA modulation.	2015-12-14	2024-03-06 19:51:50	2024-03-06T19:51:50Z		18240			5		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26657204 PMCID: PMC4677400					Abnormalities, Multiple; Animal Fins; Animals; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Therapy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Septal Defects, Atrial; Lower Extremity Deformities, Congenital; MicroRNAs; Multigene Family; Phenotype; RNA Interference; T-Box Domain Proteins; Upper Extremity Deformities, Congenital; Zebrafish

Here we identify gene transcripts that are similarly regulated during physiological ageing in nematodes, zebrafish and mice. We observe the strongest extension of lifespan when impairing expression of the branched-chain amino acid transferase-1 (bcat-1) gene in C. elegans, which leads to excessive levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). We further show that BCAAs reduce a LET-363/mTOR-dependent neuro-endocrine signal, which we identify as DAF-7/TGFβ, and that impacts lifespan depending on its related receptors, DAF-1 and DAF-4, as well as ultimately on DAF-16/FoxO and HSF-1 in a cell-non-autonomous manner. The transcription factor HLH-15 controls and epistatically synergizes with BCAT-1 to modulate physiological ageing. Lastly and consistent with previous findings in rodents, nutritional supplementation of BCAAs extends nematodal lifespan. Taken together, BCAAs act as periphery-derived metabokines that induce a central neuro-endocrine response, culminating in extended healthspan.	2015-12-01	2024-03-06 19:51:49	2024-03-06T19:51:49Z		10043			6		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26620638 PMCID: PMC4686672					Aging; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Female; Longevity; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Transaminases; Zebrafish

The extent of miRNA regulation also increases with increasing genome complexity. Though the number of genes appear to be equal between human and zebrafish, substantially less microRNAs have been discovered in zebrafish compared to human (miRBase Release 19). It appears that most of the miRNAs in zebrafish are yet to be discovered. RESULTS: We sequenced small RNAs from brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo of zebrafish. In brain, gut and liver sequencing was done sex specifically. Majority of the sequenced reads (16-62 %) mapped to known miRNAs, with the exception of ovary (5.7 %) and testis (7.8 %). Using the miRNA discovery tool (miRDeep2), we discovered novel miRNAs from the unannotated reads that ranged from 7.6 to 23.0 %, with exceptions of ovary (51.4 %) and testis (55.2 %). The prediction tool identified a total of 459 novel pre-miRNAs. We compared expression of miRNAs between different tissues and between males and females to identify tissue associated and sex associated miRNAs respectively. These miRNAs could serve as putative biomarkers for these tissues. The brain and liver had highest number of tissue associated (22) and sex associated (34) miRNAs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively identifies tissue and sex associated miRNAs in zebrafish. Further, we have discovered 459 novel pre-miRNAs (~30 % seed homology to human miRNA) as a genomic resource which can facilitate further investigations to understand miRNA-mRNA gene regulatory networks in zebrafish which will have implications in understanding the function of human homologs.	2015-11-16	2024-03-06 19:51:49	2024-03-06T19:51:49Z		950			16		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26574018 PMCID: PMC4647824					Animals; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Organ Specificity; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sex Characteristics; Zebrafish

Cyp27c1 Red-Shifts the Spectral Sensitivity of Photoreceptors by Converting Vitamin A1 into A2	Current biology: CB		1879-0445	10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.018		Some vertebrate species have evolved means of extending their visual sensitivity beyond the range of human vision. One mechanism of enhancing sensitivity to long-wavelength light is to replace the 11-cis retinal chromophore in photopigments with 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal. Despite over a century of research on this topic, the enzymatic basis of this perceptual switch remains unknown. Here, we show that a cytochrome P450 family member, Cyp27c1, mediates this switch by converting vitamin A1 (the precursor of 11-cis retinal) into vitamin A2 (the precursor of 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal). Knockout of cyp27c1 in zebrafish abrogates production of vitamin A2, eliminating the animal's ability to red-shift its photoreceptor spectral sensitivity and reducing its ability to see and respond to near-infrared light. Thus, the expression of a single enzyme mediates dynamic spectral tuning of the entire visual system by controlling the balance of vitamin A1 and A2 in the eye.	2015-12-07	2024-03-06 19:51:48	2024-03-06T19:51:48Z		3048-3057		23	25		Curr Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26549260 PMCID: PMC4910640					Amphibian Proteins; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Infrared Rays; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; Rana catesbeiana; Transcriptome; Visual Perception; Vitamin A; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Importantly, although the transcriptional regulators of embryonic HC development have been described, little is known about the postnatal regulators of maturating HCs. Here we apply a cell type-specific functional genomic analysis to the transcriptomes of auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia from early postnatal mice. We identify RFX transcription factors as essential and evolutionarily conserved regulators of the HC-specific transcriptomes, and detect Rfx1,2,3,5 and 7 in the developing HCs. To understand the role of RFX in hearing, we generate Rfx1/3 conditional knockout mice. We show that these mice are deaf secondary to rapid loss of initially well-formed outer HCs. These data identify an essential role for RFX in hearing and survival of the terminally differentiating outer HCs.	2015-10-15	2024-03-06 19:51:48	2024-03-06T19:51:48Z		8549			6		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26469318 PMCID: PMC4634137					Animals; Animals, Newborn; Biological Evolution; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Hair Cells, Auditory; Hearing; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Knockout; Multigene Family; Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors; Regulatory Factor X1; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Plenty of evidences show that some testis- or spermatozoa-specific miRNAs play crucial roles in the process of gonad and germ cell development. In this study, the spermatozoa miRNA profiles were investigated through a combination of illumina deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis in zebrafish. Deep sequencing of small RNAs yielded 11,820,680 clean reads. By mapping to the zebrafish genome, we identified 400 novel and 204 known miRNAs that could be grouped into 104 families. Furthermore, we selected the six highest expressions of known miRNAs to detect their expression patterns in different tissues by stem-loop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that among the six miRNAs, dre-miR-202-5p displayed specific and high expression in zebrafish spermatozoa and testis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that dre-miR-202-5p was predominantly expressed in all kind of germ cells at different spermatogenetic stages, including spermatogonia and spermatozoa, but barely expressed in the germ cells in the ovary. This sex-biased expression pattern suggests that dre-miR-202-5p might be related to spermatogenesis and the functioning of spermatozoa. The identification of miRNAs in zebrafish spermatozoa and germ cells offers new insights into the spermatogenesis and spermatozoa in the teleost and other vertebrates.	2015-12	2024-03-06 19:51:47	2024-03-06T19:51:47Z		387-397		6	12		Zebrafish								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26418264					Animals; Cloning, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; MicroRNAs; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results; Spermatozoa; Testis; Zebrafish

In contrast, zebrafish hearts efficiently regenerate after injury. Complete regeneration of the zebrafish heart is driven by the strong proliferation response of its cardiomyocytes to injury. Here we show that, after cardiac injury in zebrafish, telomerase becomes hyperactivated, and telomeres elongate transiently, preceding a peak of cardiomyocyte proliferation and full organ recovery. Using a telomerase-mutant zebrafish model, we found that telomerase loss drastically decreases cardiomyocyte proliferation and fibrotic tissue regression after cryoinjury and that cardiac function does not recover. The impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation response is accompanied by the absence of cardiomyocytes with long telomeres and an increased proportion of cardiomyocytes showing DNA damage and senescence characteristics. These findings demonstrate the importance of telomerase function in heart regeneration and highlight the potential of telomerase therapy as a means of stimulating cell proliferation upon myocardial infarction.	2015-09-08	2024-03-06 19:51:47	2024-03-06T19:51:47Z		1691-1703		10	12		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26321646 PMCID: PMC4589159					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression; Gene Knockout Techniques; Heart; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Telomerase; Tissue Culture Techniques; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Lymphatic vessels form by lymphangiogenesis, the sprouting of new lymphatics from pre-existing vessels, in both development and disease contexts. The apical signaling pathway in lymphangiogenesis is the VEGFC/VEGFR3 pathway, yet how signaling controls cellular transcriptional output remains unknown. We used a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify the transcription factor mafba as essential for lymphatic vessel development. We found that mafba is required for the migration of lymphatic precursors after their initial sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein. mafba expression is enriched in sprouts emerging from veins, and we show that mafba functions cell-autonomously during lymphatic vessel development. Mechanistically, Vegfc signaling increases mafba expression to control downstream transcription, and this regulatory relationship is dependent on the activity of SoxF transcription factors, which are essential for mafba expression in venous endothelium. Here we identify an indispensable Vegfc-SoxF-Mafba pathway in lymphatic development.	2015-08-01	2024-03-06 19:51:47	2024-03-06T19:51:47Z		1618-1630		15	29		Genes Dev								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26253536 PMCID: PMC4536310					Animals; Cell Movement; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Vessels; MafB Transcription Factor; Mafb; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Signal Transduction; Sox18; Sox7; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Vegfc; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; lymphatic; vascular; zebrafish

However, the cis- and trans-factors governing cold responses are not well characterized. We profiled transcriptional changes in eight zebrafish tissues exposed to mildly and severely cold temperatures using RNA-Seq. A total of 1943 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, from which 34 clusters representing distinct tissue and temperature response expression patterns were derived using the k-means fuzzy clustering algorithm. The promoter regions of the clustered DEGs that demonstrated strong co-regulation were analysed for enriched cis-regulatory elements with a motif discovery program, DREME. Seventeen motifs, ten known and seven novel, were identified, which covered 23% of the DEGs. Two motifs predicted to be the binding sites for the transcription factors Bcl6 and Jun, respectively, were chosen for experimental verification, and they demonstrated the expected cold-induced and cold-repressed patterns of gene regulation. Protein interaction modeling of the network components followed by experimental validation suggested that Jun physically interacts with Bcl6 and might be a hub factor that orchestrates the cold response in zebrafish. Thus, the methodology used and the regulatory networks uncovered in this study provide a foundation for exploring the mechanisms of cold adaptation in teleosts.	2015-10-30	2024-03-06 19:51:46	2024-03-06T19:51:46Z		9198-9213		19	43		Nucleic Acids Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26227973 PMCID: PMC4627065					Animals; Cell Line; Cold-Shock Response; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Male; Nucleotide Motifs; Organ Specificity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Interaction Mapping; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.119008		The optic vesicle comprises a pool of bi-potential progenitor cells from which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina fates segregate during ocular morphogenesis. Several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been shown to be important for RPE maintenance and differentiation, but an understanding of the initial fate specification and determination of this ocular cell type is lacking. We show that Yap/Taz-Tead activity is necessary and sufficient for optic vesicle progenitors to adopt RPE identity in zebrafish. A Tead-responsive transgene is expressed within the domain of the optic cup from which RPE arises, and Yap immunoreactivity localizes to the nuclei of prospective RPE cells. yap (yap1) mutants lack a subset of RPE cells and/or exhibit coloboma. Loss of RPE in yap mutants is exacerbated in combination with taz (wwtr1) mutant alleles such that, when Yap and Taz are both absent, optic vesicle progenitor cells completely lose their ability to form RPE. The mechanism of Yap-dependent RPE cell type determination is reliant on both nuclear localization of Yap and interaction with a Tead co-factor. In contrast to loss of Yap and Taz, overexpression of either protein within optic vesicle progenitors leads to ectopic pigmentation in a dosage-dependent manner. Overall, this study identifies Yap and Taz as key early regulators of RPE genesis and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the congenital ocular defects of Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy and congenital retinal coloboma.	2015-09-01	2024-03-06 19:51:46	2024-03-06T19:51:46Z		3021-3032		17	142		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26209646 PMCID: PMC4582179					Alleles; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Lineage; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Choroid fissure; Coloboma; DNA-Binding Proteins; Directed differentiation of stem cells; Epithelial Cells; Eye development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Reporter; HEK293 Cells; Hippo signaling; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Ocular morphogenesis; Phenotype; Protein Binding; RNA, Messenger; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Signal Transduction; Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy; TEA Domain Transcription Factors; Tfec; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins; Transgenes; Up-Regulation; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcriptomic Changes in Zebrafish Embryos and Larvae Following Benzo[a]pyrene Exposure	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfv105		Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is an environmentally relevant carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting compound that causes immediate, long-term, and multigenerational health deficits in mammals and fish. Previously, we found that BaP alters DNA methylation patterns in developing zebrafish, which may affect gene expression. Herein, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis and discovered differential gene expression and splicing in developing zebrafish. Adult zebrafish were exposed to control or 42.0 ± 1.9 µg/l BaP for 7 days. Eggs were collected and raised in control conditions or continuously exposed to BaP until 3.3 and 96 h post-fertilization (hpf). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted on zebrafish embryos and larvae. Data were analyzed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes (changed at the gene or transcript variant level) and genes with differential exon usage (DEU; changed at the exon level). At 3.3 hpf, BaP exposure resulted in 8 DE genes and 51 DEU genes. At 96 hpf, BaP exposure altered expression in 1153 DE genes and 159 DEU genes. Functional ontology analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that many disease pathways, including organismal death, growth failure, abnormal morphology of embryonic tissue, congenital heart disease, and adverse neuritogenesis, were significantly enriched for the DE and DEU genes, providing novel insights on the mechanisms of action of BaP-induced developmental toxicities. Collectively, we discovered substantial transcriptomic changes at the gene, transcript variant, and exon levels in developing zebrafish after early life BaP waterborne exposure, and these changes may lead to long-term adverse physiological consequences.	2015-08	2024-03-06 19:51:45	2024-03-06T19:51:45Z		395-411		2	146		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26001963 PMCID: PMC4607752					Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; Exons; Larva; RNA-Seq; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; alternative splicing; benzo[a]pyrene; development; gene expression; zebrafish

Centroacinar Cells Are Progenitors That Contribute to Endocrine Pancreas Regeneration	Diabetes		1939-327X	10.2337/db15-0153		Diabetes is associated with a paucity of insulin-producing β-cells. With the goal of finding therapeutic routes to treat diabetes, we aim to find molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in β-cell neogenesis and regeneration. To facilitate discovery of such mechanisms, we use a vertebrate organism where pancreatic cells readily regenerate. The larval zebrafish pancreas contains Notch-responsive progenitors that during development give rise to adult ductal, endocrine, and centroacinar cells (CACs). Adult CACs are also Notch responsive and are morphologically similar to their larval predecessors. To test our hypothesis that adult CACs are also progenitors, we took two complementary approaches: 1) We established the transcriptome for adult CACs. Using gene ontology, transgenic lines, and in situ hybridization, we found that the CAC transcriptome is enriched for progenitor markers. 2) Using lineage tracing, we demonstrated that CACs do form new endocrine cells after β-cell ablation or partial pancreatectomy. We concluded that CACs and their larval predecessors are the same cell type and represent an opportune model to study both β-cell neogenesis and β-cell regeneration. Furthermore, we show that in cftr loss-of-function mutants, there is a deficiency of larval CACs, providing a possible explanation for pancreatic complications associated with cystic fibrosis.	2015-10	2024-03-06 19:51:45	2024-03-06T19:51:45Z		3499-3509		10	64		Diabetes								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26153247 PMCID: PMC4587647					Acinar Cells; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Gene Expression Regulation; Islets of Langerhans; Larva; Pancreatectomy; RNA; Receptors, Notch; Regeneration; Stem Cells; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Ligand-Specific Transcriptional Mechanisms Underlie Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated Developmental Toxicity of Oxygenated PAHs	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfv139		Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are priority environmental contaminants that exhibit mutagenic, carcinogenic, proinflammatory, and teratogenic properties. Oxygen-substituted PAHs (OPAHs) are formed during combustion processes and via phototoxidation and biological degradation of parent (unsubstituted) PAHs. Despite their prevalence both in contaminated industrial sites and in urban air, OPAH mechanisms of action in biological systems are relatively understudied. Like parent PAHs, OPAHs exert structure-dependent mutagenic activities and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and cytochrome p450 metabolic pathway. Four-ring OPAHs 1,9-benz-10-anthrone (BEZO) and benz(a)anthracene-7,12-dione (7,12-B[a]AQ) cause morphological aberrations and induce markers of oxidative stress in developing zebrafish with similar potency, but only 7,12-B[a]AQ induces robust Cyp1a protein expression. We investigated the role of the AHR in mediating the toxicity of BEZO and 7,12-B[a]AQ, and found that knockdown of AHR2 rescued developmental effects caused by both compounds. Using RNA-seq and molecular docking, we identified transcriptional responses that precede developmental toxicity induced via differential interaction with AHR2. Redox-homeostasis genes were affected similarly by these OPAHs, while 7,12-B[a]AQ preferentially activated phase 1 metabolism and BEZO uniquely decreased visual system genes. Analysis of biological functions and upstream regulators suggests that BEZO is a weak AHR agonist, but interacts with other transcriptional regulators to cause developmental toxicity in an AHR-dependent manner. Identifying ligand-dependent AHR interactions and signaling pathways is essential for understanding toxicity of this class of environmentally relevant compounds.	2015-10	2024-03-06 19:51:45	2024-03-06T19:51:45Z		397-411		2	147		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26141390 PMCID: PMC4612346					Animals; Benz(a)Anthracenes; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Gene Expression Profiling; Ligands; OPAH; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; RNA-seq; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; benz(a)anthracene-7,12-dione; benzanthrone; zebrafish

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.	2015-05	2024-03-06 19:51:44	2024-03-06T19:51:44Z		495-502		5	33		Nat Biotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25867923 PMCID: PMC4430369					Animals; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

We developed a computational method to integrate both circadian gene expression and metabolic network. Applying this method to zebrafish circadian transcriptome, we have identified large clusters of metabolic genes containing mostly genes in purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the metabolic network showing similar circadian phases. Our metabolomics analysis found that the level of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), an intermediate metabolite in de novo purine synthesis, showed significant circadian oscillation in larval zebrafish. We focused on IMP dehydrogenase (impdh), a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo purine synthesis, with three circadian oscillating gene homologs: impdh1a, impdh1b and impdh2. Functional analysis revealed that impdh2 contributes to the daily rhythm of S phase in the cell cycle while impdh1a contributes to ocular development and pigment synthesis. The three zebrafish homologs of impdh are likely regulated by different circadian transcription factors. We propose that the circadian regulation of de novo purine synthesis that supplies crucial building blocks for DNA replication is an important mechanism conferring circadian rhythmicity on the cell cycle. Our method is widely applicable to study the impact of circadian transcriptome on metabolism in complex organisms.	2015-02	2024-03-06 19:51:44	2024-03-06T19:51:44Z		e1004086		2	11		PLoS Comput Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25714999 PMCID: PMC4340947					Animals; Brain; Cell Cycle; Circadian Rhythm; Cluster Analysis; Fish Proteins; Gene Knockdown Techniques; IMP Dehydrogenase; Larva; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Purines; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Lymphatic vessels arise from specialized angioblasts within a venous niche	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature14425		How cells acquire their fate is a fundamental question in developmental and regenerative biology. Multipotent progenitors undergo cell-fate restriction in response to cues from the microenvironment, the nature of which is poorly understood. In the case of the lymphatic system, venous cells from the cardinal vein are thought to generate lymphatic vessels through trans-differentiation. Here we show that in zebrafish, lymphatic progenitors arise from a previously uncharacterized niche of specialized angioblasts within the cardinal vein, which also generates arterial and venous fates. We further identify Wnt5b as a novel lymphatic inductive signal and show that it also promotes the ‘angioblast-to-lymphatic’ transition in human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that this process is evolutionarily conserved. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of lymphatic specification, and provide the first characterization of the lymphatic inductive niche. More broadly, our findings highlight the cardinal vein as a heterogeneous structure, analogous to the haematopoietic niche in the aortic floor.	2015-06-04	2024-03-06 19:51:44	2024-03-06T19:51:44Z		56-61		7554	522		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25992545					Animals; Arteries; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Embryonic Stem Cells; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Vessels; Multipotent Stem Cells; Stem Cell Niche; Stem Cells; Veins; Wnt Proteins; Wnt-5a Protein; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Functional studies in human cell line TF-1 indicated that FOXO3 knockdown repressed erythropoietin (EPO)-induced erythroid differentiation by activating promoter region of B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1), thereby regulating its expression. In zebrafish, injection of foxo3b-specific morpholinos (foxo3b MO) resulted in reduced globin (hbae1 and hbbe2) and gata1 gene expression. Transcriptome analyses of erythroid lineage cells isolated from the control and foxo3b morphants revealed the dynamic regulation of foxo3b. Further study suggested that BTG1 is partially responsible for FOXO3 regulation in erythroid differentiation of TF-1 cells but is inconsequential in zebrafish. Taken together, we found that FOXO3 plays an important role in erythroid differentiation in both human TF-1 cells and zebrafish, but the mechanism underlying this regulation still remains unclear.	2015-05-15	2024-03-06 19:51:44	2024-03-06T19:51:44Z		923-930		4	460		Biochem Biophys Res Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25843800					Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Differentiation; Erythrocytes; Erythroid differentiation; FOXO3; Female; Forkhead Box Protein O3; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Globin; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Transcriptome; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
PNC9ECKQ	journalArticle	2015	Banerjee, Santanu; Hayer, Katharina; Hogenesch, John B.; Granato, Michael	Zebrafish foxc1a drives appendage-specific neural circuit development	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.115816		Neural connectivity between the spinal cord and paired appendages is key to the superior locomotion of tetrapods and aquatic vertebrates. In contrast to nerves that innervate axial muscles, those innervating appendages converge at a specialized structure, the plexus, where they topographically reorganize before navigating towards their muscle targets. Despite its importance for providing appendage mobility, the genetic program that drives nerve convergence at the plexus, as well as the functional role of this convergence, are not well understood. Here, we show that in zebrafish the transcription factor foxc1a is dispensable for trunk motor nerve guidance but is required to guide spinal nerves innervating the pectoral fins, equivalent to the tetrapod forelimbs. In foxc1a null mutants, instead of converging with other nerves at the plexus, pectoral fin nerves frequently bypass the plexus. We demonstrate that foxc1a expression in muscle cells delineating the nerve path between the spinal cord and the plexus region restores convergence at the plexus. By labeling individual fin nerves, we show that mutant nerves bypassing the plexus enter the fin at ectopic positions, yet innervate their designated target areas, suggesting that motor axons can select their appropriate fin target area independently of their migration through the plexus. Although foxc1a mutants display topographically correct fin innervation, mutant fin muscles exhibit a reduction in the levels of pre- and postsynaptic structures, concomitant with reduced pectoral fin function. Combined, our results reveal foxc1a as a key player in the development of connectivity between the spinal cord and paired appendages, which is crucial for appendage mobility.	2015-02-15	2024-03-06 19:51:43	2024-03-06T19:51:43Z		753-762		4	142		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25670796 PMCID: PMC4325381					Animal Fins; Animals; Axon guidance; Axons; Extremities; Fin nerves; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Foxc1a; Limb motor neuron; Motor Neurons; Motor axon; Neurogenesis; Pectoral fin; Plexus; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
BB69Z82U	journalArticle	2015	Xu, Ting; Zhao, Jing; Yin, Daqiang; Zhao, Qingshun; Dong, Bingzhi	High-throughput RNA sequencing reveals the effects of 2,2',4,4' -tetrabromodiphenyl ether on retina and bone development of zebrafish larvae	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-014-1194-5		BACKGROUND: 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47) is a prevalent environmental pollutant and has been demonstrated to be a serious toxicant in both humans and animals, but little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying its toxic effect on the early development of vertebrates. BDE47-treated zebrafish larvae were found to present the light-related locomotion reduction in our previous study, therefore, we aimed to use high throughput sequencing to investigate the possible reasons from a transcriptomic perspective. RESULTS: By exposing zebrafish embryos/larvae to 5 μg/l and 500 μg/l BDE47, we measured the influence of BDE47 on the mRNA expression profiles of zebrafish larvae until 6 days post-fertilization, using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. Differential expression analysis and gene enrichment analysis respectively revealed that a great number of genes, and gene sets based on two popular terminologies, were affected by the treatment of 500 μg/l BDE47. Among them, BDE47 caused changes in the retinal metabolism and related biological processes involving eye morphogenesis and visual perception, as confirmed by disordered photoreceptor arrangement and thickened bipolar cell layer of larval retina from histological observations. Other altered genes such as pth1a and collaborative cathepsin family exhibited disrupted bone development, which was consistent with the body curvature phenotype. The transcriptome of larvae was not significantly affected by the treatment of 5 μg/l BDE47, as well as the treatment of DMSO vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high BDE47 concentrations disrupt the eye and bone development of zebrafish larvae based on both transcriptomic and morphological evidences. The abnormal visual perception may result in the alteration of dark adaption, which was probably responsible for the abnormal larval locomotion. Body curvature arose from enhanced bone resorption because of the intensive up-regulation of related genes. We also proposed the larval retina as a novel potential target tissue for BDE47 exposure.	2015-01-23	2024-03-06 19:51:43	2024-03-06T19:51:43Z		23		1	16		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25614096 PMCID: PMC4312473					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Bone Development; Bone and Bones; Eye; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Larva; Photoreceptor Cells; Retina; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Dysregulation of Pol III transcription has been linked to cancer, and germline mutations in genes encoding Pol III subunits or tRNA processing factors cause neurogenetic disorders in humans, such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophies and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Here we describe an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and intellectual disability, as well as facial dysmorphic features, short stature, microcephaly, and dental anomalies. Whole-exome sequencing revealed biallelic missense alterations of BRF1 in three families. In support of the pathogenic potential of the discovered alleles, suppression or CRISPR-mediated deletion of brf1 in zebrafish embryos recapitulated key neurodevelopmental phenotypes; in vivo complementation showed all four candidate mutations to be pathogenic in an apparent isoform-specific context. BRF1 associates with BDP1 and TBP to form the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB), which recruits Pol III to target genes. We show that disease-causing mutations reduce Brf1 occupancy at tRNA target genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and impair cell growth. Moreover, BRF1 mutations reduce Pol III-related transcription activity in vitro. Taken together, our data show that BRF1 mutations that reduce protein activity cause neurodevelopmental anomalies, suggesting that BRF1-mediated Pol III transcription is required for normal cerebellar and cognitive development.	2015-02	2024-03-06 19:51:42	2024-03-06T19:51:42Z		155-166		2	25		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25561519 PMCID: PMC4315290					Abnormalities, Multiple; Adolescent; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Child; Child, Preschool; Exome; Facies; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Infant; Intellectual Disability; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Pedigree; Phenotype; Protein Conformation; Protein Isoforms; RNA Polymerase III; Siblings; Syndrome; TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Fish IFNs do not show a one-to-one orthologous relationship with mammalian type I IFN homologues. Using a bacterial one-hybrid reporter screening system and an overexpression approach to explore the molecular mechanism underlying fish IFN induction, we identified zebrafish Danio rerio IRF (DrIRF)1 as a positive regulator of the fish IFN antiviral response. Among 12 zebrafish IRF family genes, DrIRF1 is most abundant in zebrafish immune tissues, including head kidney and spleen; upon virus infection, it is one of most significantly induced genes. Overexpression of DrIRF1 induces the expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes, hence protecting epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells against spring viremia of carp virus infection. As a transcription factor with constitutively nuclear retention, DrIRF1 directly binds to the IFN-stimulated regulatory element/IRF-binding element sites of zebrafish IFN promoters, which are dependent on four conserved amino acids of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain helix α3 motif. Mutation of either residue reveals a differential requirement for DrIRF1-mediated activation of zebrafish IFNϕ1 and IFNϕ3 promoters. Notably, C-terminal phosphorylation of DrIRF1 is observed and is not required for in vitro binding of DrIRF1 to fish IFN promoters. Unlike DrIRF3 and DrIRF7, which are responsible for differential expression of zebrafish IFNϕ1 and IFNϕ3 through the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor pathway, DrIRF1 works in concert with MyD88 to activate zebrafish IFNϕ3 but not IFNϕ1. These results provide insights into the evolving function of IRF1 as a positive IFN regulator.	2015-02-01	2024-03-06 19:51:42	2024-03-06T19:51:42Z		1225-1238		3	194		J Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25535281					Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Cells, Cultured; Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Order; Interferon Regulatory Factor-1; Interferons; Molecular Sequence Data; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Transport; Sequence Alignment; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Virus Diseases; Zebrafish

Analysis of RNAseq datasets from a comparative infectious disease zebrafish model using GeneTiles bioinformatics	Immunogenetics		1432-1211	10.1007/s00251-014-0820-3		We present a RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of a comparison of the transcriptome responses to infection of zebrafish larvae with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Mycobacterium marinum bacteria. We show how our developed GeneTiles software can improve RNAseq analysis approaches by more confidently identifying a large set of markers upon infection with these bacteria. For analysis of RNAseq data currently, software programs such as Bowtie2 and Samtools are indispensable. However, these programs that are designed for a LINUX environment require some dedicated programming skills and have no options for visualisation of the resulting mapped sequence reads. Especially with large data sets, this makes the analysis time consuming and difficult for non-expert users. We have applied the GeneTiles software to the analysis of previously published and newly obtained RNAseq datasets of our zebrafish infection model, and we have shown the applicability of this approach also to published RNAseq datasets of other organisms by comparing our data with a published mammalian infection study. In addition, we have implemented the DEXSeq module in the GeneTiles software to identify genes, such as glucagon A, that are differentially spliced under infection conditions. In the analysis of our RNAseq data, this has led to the possibility to improve the size of data sets that could be efficiently compared without using problem-dedicated programs, leading to a quick identification of marker sets. Therefore, this approach will also be highly useful for transcriptome analyses of other organisms for which well-characterised genomes are available.	2015-03	2024-03-06 19:51:42	2024-03-06T19:51:42Z		135-147		3	67		Immunogenetics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25503064 PMCID: PMC4325186					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Fish Diseases; Fish Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Glucagon; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Larva; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Software; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Narry	Adenylation of maternally inherited microRNAs by Wispy	Molecular Cell		1097-4164	10.1016/j.molcel.2014.10.011		Early development depends heavily on accurate control of maternally inherited mRNAs, and yet it remains unknown how maternal microRNAs are regulated during maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We here find that maternal microRNAs are highly adenylated at their 3' ends in mature oocytes and early embryos. Maternal microRNA adenylation is widely conserved in fly, sea urchin, and mouse. We identify Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, as the enzyme responsible for microRNA adenylation in flies. Knockout of wispy abrogates adenylation and results in microRNA accumulation in eggs, whereas overexpression of Wispy increases adenylation and reduces microRNA levels in S2 cells. Wispy interacts with Ago1 through protein-protein interaction, which may allow the effective and selective adenylation of microRNAs. Thus, adenylation may contribute to the clearance of maternally deposited microRNAs during MZT. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the regulation of maternal microRNAs and illustrates the importance of RNA tailing in development.	2014-12-04	2024-03-06 19:51:41	2024-03-06T19:51:41Z		696-707		5	56		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25454948 PMCID: PMC4378961					Animals; Argonaute Proteins; Cell Line; Drosophila Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockout Techniques; MicroRNAs; Molecular Sequence Data; Oocytes; Poly A; Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase

Here, we combine RNA metabolic labeling, rRNA-depleted RNA-seq, and DRiLL, a novel computational framework, to quantify the level; editing sites; and transcription, processing, and degradation rates of each transcript at a splice junction resolution during the LPS response of mouse dendritic cells. Four key regulatory strategies, dominated by RNA transcription changes, generate most temporal gene expression patterns. Noncanonical strategies that also employ dynamic posttranscriptional regulation control only a minority of genes, but provide unique signal processing features. We validate Tristetraprolin (TTP) as a major regulator of RNA degradation in one noncanonical strategy. Applying DRiLL to the regulation of noncoding RNAs and to zebrafish embryogenesis demonstrates its broad utility. Our study provides a new quantitative approach to discover transcriptional and posttranscriptional events that control dynamic changes in transcript levels using RNA sequencing data.	2014-12-18	2024-03-06 19:51:41	2024-03-06T19:51:41Z		1698-1710		7	159		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25497548 PMCID: PMC4272607					Animals; Computer Simulation; Dendritic Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Kinetics; Lipopolysaccharides; Mice; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA Stability; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription, Genetic; Tristetraprolin; Zebrafish

A spinal opsin controls early neural activity and drives a behavioral light response	Current biology: CB		1879-0445	10.1016/j.cub.2014.10.055		Nonvisual detection of light by the vertebrate hypothalamus, pineal, and retina is known to govern seasonal and circadian behaviors. However, the expression of opsins in multiple other brain structures suggests a more expansive repertoire for light regulation of physiology, behavior, and development. Translucent zebrafish embryos express extraretinal opsins early on, at a time when spontaneous activity in the developing CNS plays a role in neuronal maturation and circuit formation. Though the presence of extraretinal opsins is well documented, the function of direct photoreception by the CNS remains largely unknown. Here, we show that early activity in the zebrafish spinal central pattern generator (CPG) and the earliest locomotory behavior are dramatically inhibited by physiological levels of environmental light. We find that the photosensitivity of this circuit is conferred by vertebrate ancient long opsin A (VALopA), which we show to be a Gα(i)-coupled receptor that is expressed in the neurons of the spinal network. Sustained photoactivation of VALopA not only suppresses spontaneous activity but also alters the maturation of time-locked correlated network patterns. These results uncover a novel role for nonvisual opsins and a mechanism for environmental regulation of spontaneous motor behavior and neural activity in a circuit previously thought to be governed only by intrinsic developmental programs.	2015-01-05	2024-03-06 19:51:41	2024-03-06T19:51:41Z		69-74		1	25		Curr Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25484291 PMCID: PMC4286461					Animals; Behavior, Animal; Central Nervous System; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Light; Motor Activity; Opsins; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Xenopus; Zebrafish

Although genome-wide techniques such as RNA sequencing are ideally suited for discovering novel candidate genes, they are unable to yield spatially resolved information in embryos or tissues. Microscopy-based approaches, using in situ hybridization, for example, can provide spatial information about gene expression, but are limited to analyzing one or a few genes at a time. Here, we present a method where we combine traditional histological techniques with low-input RNA sequencing and mathematical image reconstruction to generate a high-resolution genome-wide 3D atlas of gene expression in the zebrafish embryo at three developmental stages. Importantly, our technique enables searching for genes that are expressed in specific spatial patterns without manual image annotation. We envision broad applicability of RNA tomography as an accurate and sensitive approach for spatially resolved transcriptomics in whole embryos and dissected organs.	2014-10-23	2024-03-06 19:51:41	2024-03-06T19:51:41Z		662-675		3	159		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25417113					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Tomography; Zebrafish

It is known that the association between these pathologies works in both directions, for which heart failure can lead to metabolic derangements such as insulin resistance. This intricate crosstalk exemplifies the importance of a fine coordination between one of the most energy-demanding organs and an equilibrated carbohydrate metabolism. In this light, to assist in the understanding of the role of insulin-regulated glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the development of cardiomyopathies, we have developed a model for glut12 deficiency in zebrafish. GLUT12 is a novel insulin-regulated GLUT expressed in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, such as cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In this study, we show that glut12 knockdown impacts the development of the embryonic heart resulting in abnormal valve formation. Moreover, glut12-deficient embryos also exhibited poor glycemic control. Glucose measurements showed that these larvae were hyperglycemic and resistant to insulin administration. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that a number of genes known to be important in cardiac development and function as well as metabolic mediators were dysregulated in these larvae. These results indicate that glut12 is an essential GLUT in the heart where the reduction in glucose uptake due to glut12 deficiency leads to heart failure presumably due to the lack of glucose as energy substrate. In addition, the diabetic phenotype displayed by these larvae after glut12 abrogation highlights the importance of this GLUT during early developmental stages.	2015-01	2024-03-06 19:51:40	2024-03-06T19:51:40Z		1-15		1	224		J Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25326603					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative; Heart Failure; Insulin; Metformin; Phenotype; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; diabetes; glut12; heart failure; valve dysgenesis; zebrafish

Genes and signaling networks regulated during zebrafish optic vesicle morphogenesis	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/1471-2164-15-825		BACKGROUND: The genetic cascades underpinning vertebrate early eye morphogenesis are poorly understood. One gene family essential for eye morphogenesis encodes the retinal homeobox (Rx) transcription factors. Mutations in the human retinal homeobox gene (RAX) can lead to gross morphological phenotypes ranging from microphthalmia to anophthalmia. Zebrafish rx3 null mutants produce a similar striking eyeless phenotype with an associated expanded forebrain. Thus, we used zebrafish rx3-/- mutants as a model to uncover an Rx3-regulated gene network during early eye morphogenesis. RESULTS: Rx3-regulated genes were identified using whole transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) of rx3-/- mutants and morphologically wild-type siblings during optic vesicle morphogenesis. A gene co-expression network was then constructed for the Rx3-regulated genes, identifying gene cross-talk during early eye development. Genes highly connected in the network are hub genes, which tend to exhibit higher expression changes between rx3-/- mutants and normal phenotype siblings. Hub genes down-regulated in rx3-/- mutants encompass homeodomain transcription factors and mediators of retinoid-signaling, both associated with eye development and known human eye disorders. In contrast, genes up-regulated in rx3-/- mutants are centered on Wnt signaling pathways, associated with brain development and disorders. The temporal expression pattern of Rx3-regulated genes was further profiled during early development from maternal stage until visual function is fully mature. Rx3-regulated genes exhibited synchronized expression patterns, and a transition of gene expression during the early segmentation stage when Rx3 was highly expressed. Furthermore, most of these deregulated genes are enriched with multiple RAX-binding motif sequences on the gene promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we assembled a comprehensive model of Rx3-regulated genes during early eye morphogenesis. Rx3 promotes optic vesicle morphogenesis and represses brain development through a highly correlated and modulated network, exhibiting repression of genes mediating Wnt signaling and concomitant enhanced expression of homeodomain transcription factors and retinoid-signaling genes.	2014-09-30	2024-03-06 19:51:40	2024-03-06T19:51:40Z		825		1	15		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25266257 PMCID: PMC4190348					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Binding Sites; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Library; Gene Regulatory Networks; Homeodomain Proteins; Morphogenesis; Retina; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Global identification of Smad2 and Eomesodermin targets in zebrafish identifies a conserved transcriptional network in mesendoderm and a novel role for Eomesodermin in repression of ectodermal gene expression	BMC biology		1741-7007	10.1186/s12915-014-0081-5		BACKGROUND: Nodal signalling is an absolute requirement for normal mesoderm and endoderm formation in vertebrate embryos, yet the transcriptional networks acting directly downstream of Nodal and the extent to which they are conserved is largely unexplored, particularly in vivo. Eomesodermin also plays a role in patterning mesoderm and endoderm in vertebrates, but its mechanisms of action, and how it interacts with the Nodal signalling pathway are still unclear. RESULTS: Using a combination of ChIP-seq and expression analysis we identify direct targets of Smad2, the effector of Nodal signalling in blastula stage zebrafish embryos, including many novel target genes. Through comparison of these data with published ChIP-seq data in human, mouse and Xenopus we show that the transcriptional network driven by Smad2 in mesoderm and endoderm is conserved in these vertebrate species. We also show that Smad2 and zebrafish Eomesodermin a (Eomesa) bind common genomic regions proximal to genes involved in mesoderm and endoderm formation, suggesting Eomesa forms a general component of the Smad2 signalling complex in zebrafish. Combinatorial perturbation of Eomesa and Smad2-interacting factor Foxh1 results in loss of both mesoderm and endoderm markers, confirming the role of Eomesa in endoderm formation and its functional interaction with Foxh1 for correct Nodal signalling. Finally, we uncover a novel, role for Eomesa in repressing ectodermal genes in the early blastula. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved developmental functions of Nodal signalling occur through maintenance of the transcriptional network directed by Smad2. This network is modulated by Eomesa in zebrafish which acts to promote mesoderm and endoderm formation in combination with Nodal signalling, whilst Eomesa also opposes ectoderm gene expression. Eomesa therefore regulates the formation of all three germ layers in the early zebrafish embryo.	2014-10-03	2024-03-06 19:51:40	2024-03-06T19:51:40Z		81			12		BMC Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25277163 PMCID: PMC4206766					Animals; Body Patterning; Ectoderm; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endoderm; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Mesoderm; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; T-Box Domain Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Macrophage-expressed perforins mpeg1 and mpeg1.2 have an anti-bacterial function in zebrafish	Journal of Innate Immunity		1662-8128	10.1159/000366103		Macrophage-expressed gene 1 (MPEG1) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein with a predicted membrane attack complex/perforin domain associated with host defence against invading pathogens. In vertebrates, MPEG1/perforin-2 is an integral membrane protein of macrophages, suspected to be involved in the killing of intracellular bacteria by pore-forming activity. Zebrafish have 3 copies of MPEG1; 2 are expressed in macrophages, whereas the third could be a pseudogene. The mpeg1 and mpeg1.2 genes show differential regulation during infection of zebrafish embryos with the bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium marinum and Salmonella typhimurium. While mpeg1 is downregulated during infection with both pathogens, mpeg1.2 is infection inducible. Upregulation of mpeg1.2 is partially dependent on the presence of functional Mpeg1 and requires the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule MyD88 and the transcription factor NFκB. Knockdown of mpeg1 alters the immune response to M. marinum infection and results in an increased bacterial burden. In Salmonella typhimurium infection, both mpeg1 and mpeg1.2 knockdown increase the bacterial burdens, but mpeg1 morphants show increased survival times. The combined results of these two in vivo infection models support the anti-bacterial function of the MPEG1/perforin-2 family and indicate that the intricate cross-regulation of the two mpeg1 copies aids the zebrafish host in combatting infection of various pathogens.	2015	2024-03-06 19:51:40	2024-03-06T19:51:40Z		136-152		2	7		J Innate Immun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25247677 PMCID: PMC6738794					Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Macrophages; Membrane Proteins; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; NF-kappa B; Perforin; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Salmonella Infections, Animal; Salmonella typhimurium; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Dynamic miRNA expression patterns during retinal regeneration in zebrafish: reduced dicer or miRNA expression suppresses proliferation of Müller glia-derived neuronal progenitor cells	Developmental Dynamics: An Official Publication of the American Association of Anatomists		1097-0177	10.1002/dvdy.24188		BACKGROUND: Adult zebrafish spontaneously regenerate their retinas after damage. Although a number of genes and signaling pathways involved in regeneration have been identified, the exact mechanisms regulating various aspects of regeneration are unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) were examined for their potential roles in regulating zebrafish retinal regeneration. RESULTS: To investigate the requirement of miRNAs during zebrafish retinal regeneration, we knocked down the expression of Dicer in retinas prior to light-induced damage. Reduced Dicer expression significantly decreased the number of proliferating Müller glia-derived neuronal progenitor cells during regeneration. To identify individual miRNAs with roles in neuronal progenitor cell proliferation, we collected retinas at different stages of light damage and performed small RNA high-throughput sequencing. We identified subsets of miRNAs that were differentially expressed during active regeneration but returned to basal levels once regeneration was completed. We then knocked down five different miRNAs that increased in expression and assessed the effects on retinal regeneration. Reduction of miR-142b and miR-146a expression significantly reduced INL proliferation at 51 h of light treatment, while knockdown of miR-7a, miR-27c, and miR-31 expression significantly reduced INL proliferation at 72 h of constant light. CONCLUSIONS: miRNAs exhibit dynamic expression profiles during retinal regeneration and are necessary for neuronal progenitor cell proliferation.	2014-12	2024-03-06 19:51:39	2024-03-06T19:51:39Z		1591-1605		12	243		Dev Dyn	Dynamic miRNA expression patterns during retinal regeneration in zebrafish							eng					PubMed		PMID: 25220904 PMCID: PMC4237695					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Dicer; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; MicroRNAs; Neural Stem Cells; Neuroglia; Regeneration; Retina; Ribonuclease III; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; miRNAs; retinal regeneration; zebrafish

Identification of differentially expressed genes during development of the zebrafish pineal complex using RNA sequencing	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.015		We describe a method for isolating RNA suitable for high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from small numbers of fluorescently labeled cells isolated from live zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos without using costly, commercially available columns. This method ensures high cell viability after dissociation and suspension of cells and gives a very high yield of intact RNA. We demonstrate the utility of our new protocol by isolating RNA from fluorescence activated cell sorted (FAC sorted) pineal complex neurons in wild-type and tbx2b knockdown embryos at 24 hours post-fertilization. Tbx2b is a transcription factor required for pineal complex formation. We describe a bioinformatics pipeline used to analyze differential expression following high-throughput sequencing and demonstrate the validity of our results using in situ hybridization of differentially expressed transcripts. This protocol brings modern transcriptome analysis to the study of small cell populations in zebrafish.	2014-11-01	2024-03-06 19:51:39	2024-03-06T19:51:39Z		144-153		1	395		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25173875 PMCID: PMC4190028					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Bioinformatics; Cell dissociation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Epithalamus; FACS; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; In Situ Hybridization; Parapineal; Pineal; Pineal Gland; Pineal complex; RNA-seq; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; T-Box Domain Proteins; Tbx2b; Time Factors; Transcriptome; Transcriptome analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

HHEX is a transcriptional regulator of the VEGFC/FLT4/PROX1 signaling axis during vascular development	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-018-05039-1		Formation of the lymphatic system requires the coordinated expression of several key regulators: vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), its receptor FLT4, and a key transcriptional effector, PROX1. Yet, how expression of these signaling components is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, using a combination of genetic and molecular approaches, we identify the transcription factor hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) as an upstream regulator of VEGFC, FLT4, and PROX1 during angiogenic sprouting and lymphatic formation in vertebrates. By analyzing zebrafish mutants, we found that hhex is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis from the posterior cardinal vein, a process required for lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, studies of mammalian HHEX using tissue-specific genetic deletions in mouse and knockdowns in cultured human endothelial cells reveal its highly conserved function during vascular and lymphatic development. Our findings that HHEX is essential for the regulation of the VEGFC/FLT4/PROX1 axis provide insights into the molecular regulation of lymphangiogenesis.	2018-07-13	2024-03-06 19:56:14	2024-03-06T19:56:14Z		2704		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30006544 PMCID: PMC6045644					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Base Sequence; Blood Vessels; Cell Line; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Vessels; Mice; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Repressor Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, we report that PIK3C3 deficiency in zebrafish results in intestinal injury and inflammation. In pik3c3 mutants, gut tube forms but fails to be maintained. Gene expression analysis reveals that barrier-function-related inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes (e-cadherin, hnf4a, ttc7a) are suppressed, while inflammatory response genes are stimulated in the mutants. Histological analysis shows neutrophil infiltration into mutant intestinal epithelium and the clearance of gut microbiota. Yet, gut microorganisms appear dispensable as mutants cultured under germ-free condition have similar intestinal defects. Mechanistically, we show that PIK3C3 deficiency suppresses the formation of PI3P and disrupts the polarized distribution of cell-junction proteins in intestinal epithelial cells. These results not only reveal a role of PIK3C3 in gut homeostasis, but also provide a zebrafish IBD model.	2018-07-06	2024-03-06 19:56:14	2024-03-06T19:56:14Z		2639		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29980668 PMCID: PMC6035235					Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cadherins; Cell Polarity; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endocytosis; Enterocytes; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Larva; Mice; Mutation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Zebrafish

Analysis of novel caudal hindbrain genes reveals different regulatory logic for gene expression in rhombomere 4 versus 5/6 in embryonic zebrafish	Neural Development		1749-8104	10.1186/s13064-018-0112-y		BACKGROUND: Previous work aimed at understanding the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing caudal hindbrain formation identified morphogens such as Retinoic Acid (RA) and Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), as well as transcription factors like hoxb1b, hoxb1a, hnf1ba, and valentino as being required for rhombomere (r) r4-r6 formation in zebrafish. Considering that the caudal hindbrain is relatively complex - for instance, unique sets of neurons are formed in each rhombomere segment - it is likely that additional essential genes remain to be identified and integrated into the caudal hindbrain GRN. METHODS: By taking advantage of gene expression data available in the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), we identified 84 uncharacterized genes that are expressed in r4-r6. We selected a representative set of 22 genes and assayed their expression patterns in hoxb1b, hoxb1a, hnf1b, and valentino mutants with the goal of positioning them in the caudal hindbrain GRN. We also investigated the effects of RA and FGF on the expression of this gene set. To examine whether these genes are necessary for r4-r6 development, we analyzed germline mutants for six of the genes (gas6, gbx1, sall4, eglf6, celf2, and greb1l) for defects in hindbrain development. RESULTS: Our results reveal that r4 gene expression is unaffected by the individual loss of hoxb1b, hoxb1a or RA, but is under the combinatorial regulation of RA together with hoxb1b. In contrast, r5/r6 gene expression is dependent on RA, FGF, hnf1ba and valentino - as individual loss of these factors abolishes r5/r6 gene expression. Our analysis of six mutant lines did not reveal rhombomere or neuronal defects, but transcriptome analysis of one line (gas6 mutant) identified expression changes for genes involved in several developmental processes - suggesting that these genes may have subtle roles in hindbrain development. CONCLUSION: We conclude that r4-r6 formation is relatively robust, such that very few genes are absolutely required for this process. However, there are mechanistic differences in r4 versus r5/r6, such that no single factor is required for r4 development while several genes are individually required for r5/r6 formation.	2018-06-26	2024-03-06 19:56:13	2024-03-06T19:56:13Z		13		1	13		Neural Dev								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29945667 PMCID: PMC6020313					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Fibroblast growth factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene regulatory network; Hindbrain; Homeodomain Proteins; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2; PG1 hox; Pyrroles; RNA, Messenger; Retinoic acid; Rhombencephalon; Rhombomere; Valentino; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; hnf1ba

A Rapid Method for Directed Gene Knockout for Screening in G0 Zebrafish	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2018.06.003		Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetics. Reverse genetic approaches are limited by the time required to generate stable mutant lines. We describe a system for gene knockout that consistently produces null phenotypes in G0 zebrafish. Yolk injection of sets of four CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes redundantly targeting a single gene recapitulated germline-transmitted knockout phenotypes in >90% of G0 embryos for each of 8 test genes. Early embryonic (6 hpf) and stable adult phenotypes were produced. Simultaneous multi-gene knockout was feasible but associated with toxicity in some cases. To facilitate use, we generated a lookup table of four-guide sets for 21,386 zebrafish genes and validated several. Using this resource, we targeted 50 cardiomyocyte transcriptional regulators and uncovered a role of zbtb16a in cardiac development. This system provides a platform for rapid screening of genes of interest in development, physiology, and disease models in zebrafish.	2018-07-02	2024-03-06 19:56:13	2024-03-06T19:56:13Z		112-125.e4		1	46		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29974860					Animals; Base Sequence; CRISPR; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cas9; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; G0; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genetic Engineering; Heart; Morpholinos; Myocytes, Cardiac; Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; gene editing; mutagenesis; reverse genetic screen; zebrafish

Zebrafish rb1 brain tumors caused by TALEN or CRISPR targeting are histologically similar to human central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS-PNETs). Like the human oligoneural OLIG2+/SOX10+ CNS-PNET subtype, zebrafish rb1 tumors show elevated expression of neural progenitor transcription factors olig2, sox10, sox8b and the receptor tyrosine kinase erbb3a oncogene. Comparison of rb1 tumor and rb1/rb1 germline mutant larval transcriptomes shows that the altered oligoneural precursor signature is specific to tumor tissue. More than 170 chromatin regulators were differentially expressed in rb1 tumors, including overexpression of chromatin remodeler components histone deacetylase 1 (hdac1) and retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (rbbp4). Germline mutant analysis confirms that zebrafish rb1, rbbp4 and hdac1 are required during brain development. rb1 is necessary for neural precursor cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation, rbbp4 is required for survival of postmitotic precursors, and hdac1 maintains proliferation of the neural stem cell/progenitor pool. We present an in vivo assay using somatic CRISPR targeting plus live imaging of histone-H2A.F/Z-GFP fusion protein in developing larval brain to rapidly test the role of chromatin remodelers in neural stem and progenitor cells. Our somatic assay recapitulates germline mutant phenotypes and reveals a dynamic view of their roles in neural cell populations. Our study provides new insight into the epigenetic processes that might drive pathogenesis in RB1 brain tumors, and identifies Rbbp4 and its associated chromatin remodeling complexes as potential target pathways to induce apoptosis in RB1 mutant brain cancer cells.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.	2018-06-15	2024-03-06 19:56:12	2024-03-06T19:56:12Z		dmm034124		6	11		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29914980 PMCID: PMC6031359					Animals; Brain Neoplasms; CRISPR somatic targeting; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetic regulators; Hdac1; Histone Deacetylase 1; Neural Stem Cells; Neural progenitor; RB1 embryonal oligoneural brain tumor; Rbbp4; Retinoblastoma Protein; Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 4; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

TALE factors use two distinct functional modes to control an essential zebrafish gene expression program	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.36144		TALE factors are broadly expressed embryonically and known to function in complexes with transcription factors (TFs) like Hox proteins at gastrula/segmentation stages, but it is unclear if such generally expressed factors act by the same mechanism throughout embryogenesis. We identify a TALE-dependent gene regulatory network (GRN) required for anterior development and detect TALE occupancy associated with this GRN throughout embryogenesis. At blastula stages, we uncover a novel functional mode for TALE factors, where they occupy genomic DECA motifs with nearby NF-Y sites. We demonstrate that TALE and NF-Y form complexes and regulate chromatin state at genes of this GRN. At segmentation stages, GRN-associated TALE occupancy expands to include HEXA motifs near PBX:HOX sites. Hence, TALE factors control a key GRN, but utilize distinct DNA motifs and protein partners at different stages - a strategy that may also explain their oncogenic potential and may be employed by other broadly expressed TFs.	2018-06-18	2024-03-06 19:56:12	2024-03-06T19:56:12Z		e36144			7		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29911973 PMCID: PMC6023610					Animals; Blastula; CCAAT-Binding Factor; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Essential; Homeodomain Proteins; Pbx; Prep; Protein Binding; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; chromatin; developmental biology; gene network; maternal regulation; pioneer factor; regenerative medicine; stem cells; zebrafish

RegenDbase: a comparative database of noncoding RNA regulation of tissue regeneration circuits across multiple taxa	NPJ Regenerative medicine		2057-3995	10.1038/s41536-018-0049-0		Regeneration is an endogenous process of tissue repair that culminates in complete restoration of tissue and organ function. While regenerative capacity in mammals is limited to select tissues, lower vertebrates like zebrafish and salamanders are endowed with the capacity to regenerate entire limbs and most adult tissues, including heart muscle. Numerous profiling studies have been conducted using these research models in an effort to identify the genetic circuits that accompany tissue regeneration. Most of these studies, however, are confined to an individual injury model and/or research organism and focused primarily on protein encoding transcripts. Here we describe RegenDbase, a new database with the functionality to compare and contrast gene regulatory pathways within and across tissues and research models. RegenDbase combines pipelines that integrate analysis of noncoding RNAs in combination with protein encoding transcripts. We created RegenDbase with a newly generated comprehensive dataset for adult zebrafish heart regeneration combined with existing microarray and RNA-sequencing studies on multiple injured tissues. In this current release, we detail microRNA-mRNA regulatory circuits and the biological processes these interactions control during the early stages of heart regeneration. Moreover, we identify known and putative novel lncRNAs and identify their potential target genes based on proximity searches. We postulate that these candidate factors underscore robust regenerative capacity in lower vertebrates. RegenDbase provides a systems-level analysis of tissue regeneration genetic circuits across injury and animal models and addresses the growing need to understand how noncoding RNAs influence these changes in gene expression.	2018	2024-03-06 19:56:12	2024-03-06T19:56:12Z		10			3		NPJ Regen Med	RegenDbase							eng					PubMed		PMID: 29872545 PMCID: PMC5973935

The Hippo pathway effector Wwtr1 regulates cardiac wall maturation in zebrafish	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.159210		Cardiac trabeculation is a highly regulated process that starts with the delamination of compact layer cardiomyocytes. The Hippo signaling pathway has been implicated in cardiac development but many questions remain. We have investigated the role of Wwtr1, a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway, in zebrafish and find that its loss leads to reduced cardiac trabeculation. However, in mosaic animals, wwtr1-/- cardiomyocytes contribute more frequently than wwtr1+/- cardiomyocytes to the trabecular layer of wild-type hearts. To investigate this paradox, we examined the myocardial wall at early stages and found that compact layer cardiomyocytes in wwtr1-/- hearts exhibit disorganized cortical actin structure and abnormal cell-cell junctions. Accordingly, wild-type cardiomyocytes in mosaic mutant hearts contribute less frequently to the trabecular layer than when present in mosaic wild-type hearts, indicating that wwtr1-/- hearts are not able to support trabeculation. We also found that Nrg/Erbb2 signaling, which is required for trabeculation, could promote Wwtr1 nuclear export in cardiomyocytes. Altogether, these data suggest that Wwtr1 establishes the compact wall architecture necessary for trabeculation, and that Nrg/Erbb2 signaling negatively regulates its nuclear localization and therefore its activity.	2018-05-17	2024-03-06 19:56:11	2024-03-06T19:56:11Z		dev159210		10	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29773645					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; Heart; Heart development; Hippo pathway; Intercellular Junctions; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Morpholinos; Myocytes, Cardiac; Myosin Heavy Chains; Neuregulins; Organogenesis; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Receptor, ErbB-2; Serine-Threonine Kinase 3; Signal Transduction; Taz; Trabeculation; Trans-Activators; Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins; Troponin T; Wwtr1; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Yap; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

But whereas neutrophil responses to microbes are generally protective, neutrophil recruitment into damaged tissues without infection is deleterious. Why neutrophils respond to tissue damage and not just to microbes is unknown. Is it a flaw of the innate immune system that persists because evolution did not select against it, or does it provide a selective advantage? Here we dissect the contribution of tissue damage signaling to antimicrobial immune responses in a live vertebrate. By intravital imaging of zebrafish larvae, a powerful model for innate immunity, we show that prevention of tissue damage signaling upon microbial ear infection abrogates leukocyte chemotaxis and reduces animal survival, at least in part, through suppression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPla2), which integrates tissue damage- and microbe-derived cues. Thus, microbial cues are insufficient, and damage signaling is essential for antimicrobial neutrophil responses in zebrafish.	2018-05-15	2024-03-06 19:56:11	2024-03-06T19:56:11Z		1006-1013.e6		5	48		Immunity								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29768163 PMCID: PMC6082643					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Fish Diseases; Immunity, Innate; Larva; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
VWZAXYA3	journalArticle	2018	Matern, Maggie S.; Beirl, Alisha; Ogawa, Yoko; Song, Yang; Paladugu, Nikhil; Kindt, Katie S.; Hertzano, Ronna	Transcriptomic Profiling of Zebrafish Hair Cells Using RiboTag	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2018.00047		The zebrafish inner ear organs and lateral line neuromasts are comprised of a variety of cell types, including mechanosensitive hair cells. Zebrafish hair cells are evolutionarily homologous to mammalian hair cells, and have been particularly useful for studying normal hair cell development and function. However, the relative scarcity of hair cells within these complex organs, as well as the difficulty of fine dissection at early developmental time points, makes hair cell-specific gene expression profiling technically challenging. Cell sorting methods, as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, have proved to be very informative in studying hair cell-specific gene expression. However, these methods require that tissues are dissociated, the processing for which can lead to changes in gene expression prior to RNA extraction. To bypass this problem, we have developed a transgenic zebrafish model to evaluate the translatome of the inner ear and lateral line hair cells in their native tissue environment; the Tg(myo6b:RiboTag) zebrafish. This model expresses both GFP and a hemagglutinin (HA) tagged rpl10a gene under control of the myo6b promoter (myo6b:GFP-2A-rpl10a-3xHA), resulting in HA-tagged ribosomes expressed specifically in hair cells. Consequently, intact zebrafish larvae can be used to enrich for actively translated hair cell mRNA via an immunoprecipitation protocol using an antibody for the HA-tag (similar to the RiboTag mice). We demonstrate that this model can be used to reliably enrich for actively translated zebrafish hair cell mRNA. Additionally, we perform a global hair cell translatome analysis using RNA-Seq and show enrichment of known hair cell expressed transcripts and depletion of non-hair cell expressed transcripts in the immunoprecipitated material compared with mRNA extracted from whole fish (input). Our results show that our model can identify novel hair cell expressed genes in intact zebrafish, without inducing changes to gene expression that result from tissue dissociation and delays during cell sorting. Overall, we believe that this model will be highly useful for studying changes in zebrafish hair cell-specific gene expression in response to developmental progression, mutations, as well as hair cell damage by noise or ototoxic drug exposure.	2018	2024-03-06 19:56:11	2024-03-06T19:56:11Z		47			6		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29765956 PMCID: PMC5939014					RNA-Seq; RiboTag; hair cells; inner ear; zebrafish

Complex processes of cell diversification and tissue morphogenesis allow the left and right cardiac compartments to become distinct but remain poorly understood. Here, we describe an unexpected laterality in the single zebrafish atrium analogous to that of the two atria in amniotes, including mammals. This laterality appears to derive from an embryonic antero-posterior asymmetry revealed by the expression of the transcription factor gene meis2b. In adult zebrafish hearts, meis2b expression is restricted to the left side of the atrium where it controls the expression of pitx2c, a regulator of left atrial identity in mammals. Altogether, our studies suggest that the multi-chambered atrium in amniotes arose from a molecular blueprint present before the evolutionary emergence of cardiac septation and provide insights into the establishment of atrial asymmetry.	2018-05-15	2024-03-06 19:56:10	2024-03-06T19:56:10Z		e32833			7		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29762122 PMCID: PMC5953537					Animals; Body Patterning; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart; Homeodomain Proteins; Organogenesis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; heart development; left-right asymmetry; meis2; morphogenesis; mouse; stem cells; zebrafish

This necessity for retina regeneration is often compromised in mammals. We explored the significance of developmentally inevitable Sonic hedgehog signaling and found its necessity in MG reprogramming during retina regeneration. We report on stringent translational regulation of sonic hedgehog, smoothened, and patched1 by let-7 microRNA, which is regulated by Lin28a, in Müller glia (MG)-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs). We also show Shh-signaling-mediated induction of Ascl1 in mouse and zebrafish retina. Moreover, Shh-signaling-dependent regulation of matrix metalloproteinase9, in turn, regulates Shha levels and genes essential for retina regeneration, such as lin28a, zic2b, and foxn4. These observations were further confirmed through whole-retina RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. This mechanistic gene expression network could lead to a better understanding of retina regeneration and, consequently, aid in designing strategies for therapeutic intervention in human retinal diseases.	2018-05-01	2024-03-06 19:56:10	2024-03-06T19:56:10Z		1409-1423		5	23		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29719254 PMCID: PMC5946716					Animals; Ascl1a; Ependymoglial Cells; Foxn4; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hedgehog Proteins; Humans; Lin28; MicroRNAs; Mmp9; Regeneration; Retina; Shh; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zic2b; let-7; regeneration; retina; zebrafish

Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to >92,000 cells from zebrafish embryos during the first day of development. Using a graph-based approach, we mapped a cell-state landscape that describes axis patterning, germ layer formation, and organogenesis. We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-based barcoding approach (TracerSeq) for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates. Cell fates remained restricted to this landscape in embryos lacking the chordin gene. We provide web-based resources for further analysis of the single-cell data.	2018-06-01	2024-03-06 19:56:09	2024-03-06T19:56:09Z		981-987		6392	360		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29700229 PMCID: PMC6083445					Animals; Clonal Evolution; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glycoproteins; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aar3131		During embryogenesis, cells acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional states. To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.	2018-06-01	2024-03-06 19:56:09	2024-03-06T19:56:09Z		eaar3131		6392	360		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29700225 PMCID: PMC6247916					Animals; Blastula; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Signal Transduction; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
QC3RAYPF	journalArticle	2018	Than-Trong, Emmanuel; Ortica-Gatti, Sara; Mella, Sébastien; Nepal, Chirag; Alunni, Alessandro; Bally-Cuif, Laure	Neural stem cell quiescence and stemness are molecularly distinct outputs of the Notch3 signalling cascade in the vertebrate adult brain	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.161034		Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult vertebrate brain are found in a quiescent state and can preserve long-lasting progenitor potential (stemness). Whether and how these two properties are linked, and to what extent they can be independently controlled by NSC maintenance pathways, is unresolved. We have previously identified Notch3 signalling as a major quiescence-promoting pathway in adult NSCs of the zebrafish pallium. We now show that Notch3 also controls NSC stemness. Using parallel transcriptomic characterizations of notch3 mutant NSCs and adult NSC physiological states, we demonstrate that a set of potentially direct Notch3 target genes distinguishes quiescence and stemness control. As a proof of principle, we focus on one 'stemness' target, encoding the bHLH transcription factor Hey1, that has not yet been analysed in adult NSCs. We show that abrogation of Hey1 function in adult pallial NSCs in vivo, including quiescent NSCs, leads to their differentiation without affecting their proliferation state. These results demonstrate that quiescence and stemness are molecularly distinct outputs of Notch3 signalling, and identify Hey1 as a major Notch3 effector controlling NSC stemness in the vertebrate adult brain.	2018-05-15	2024-03-06 19:56:09	2024-03-06T19:56:09Z		dev161034		10	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29695612 PMCID: PMC6001379					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Brain; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Hey1; Neural Stem Cells; Neural stem cell; Neurogenesis; Notch3; Pallium; Quiescence; Receptor, Notch3; Signal Transduction; Stemness; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, very little is known about the impact of toxicant-induced DNA methylation changes on gene expression patterns. The objective of this study was to determine the genome-wide changes in DNA methylation concomitant with altered gene expression patterns in response to 3, 3', 4, 4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) exposure. We used PCB126 as a model environmental chemical because the mechanism of action is well-characterized, involving activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor. Adult zebrafish were exposed to 10 nM PCB126 for 24 h (water-borne exposure) and brain and liver tissues were sampled at 7 days post-exposure in order to capture both primary and secondary changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. We used enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing and RNAseq to quantify DNA methylation and gene expression, respectively. Enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed 573 and 481 differentially methylated regions in the liver and brain, respectively. Most of the differentially methylated regions are located more than 10 kilobases upstream of transcriptional start sites of the nearest neighboring genes. Gene Ontology analysis of these genes showed that they belong to diverse physiological pathways including development, metabolic processes and regeneration. RNAseq results revealed differential expression of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress and energy metabolism in response to polychlorinated biphenyl exposure. There was very little correlation between differentially methylated regions and differentially expressed genes suggesting that the relationship between methylation and gene expression is dynamic and complex, involving multiple layers of regulation.	2018-01	2024-03-06 19:56:09	2024-03-06T19:56:09Z		dvy005		1	4		Environ Epigenet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29686887 PMCID: PMC5905506					PCBs; RNAseq; brain; enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (eRRBS); liver

Immune cells and their associated molecules are responsible for detecting and eliminating cancer cells as they establish themselves as the precursors of a tumour. By the time a patient has a detectable solid tumour, cancer cells have escaped the initial immune response mechanisms. Here, we describe the development of a double binary zebrafish model that enables regulatory programming of the myeloid cells as they respond to oncogene-activated melanocytes to be explored, focussing on the initial phase when cells become the precursors of cancer. A hormone-inducible binary system allows for temporal control of expression of different Ras oncogenes (NRasQ61K, HRasG12V and KRasG12V) in melanocytes, leading to proliferation and changes in morphology of the melanocytes. This model was coupled to binary cell-specific biotagging models allowing in vivo biotinylation and subsequent isolation of macrophage or neutrophil nuclei for regulatory profiling of their active transcriptomes. Nuclear transcriptional profiling of neutrophils, performed as they respond to the earliest precursors of melanoma in vivo, revealed an intricate landscape of regulatory factors that may promote progression to melanoma, including Serpinb1l4, Fgf1, Fgf6, Cathepsin H, Galectin 1 and Galectin 3. The model presented here provides a powerful platform to study the myeloid response to the earliest precursors of melanoma.	2018-04-06	2024-03-06 19:56:08	2024-03-06T19:56:08Z		dmm030056		4	11		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29666124 PMCID: PMC5963855					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Biotagging; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Proliferation; Cell Shape; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, ras; Macrophage; Melanocyte; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Mifepristone; Models, Animal; Myeloid Cells; Neutrophil; Neutrophils; Oncogene; Oncogenes; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly used to identify cell types in a tissue or organ. However, organizing the resulting taxonomy of cell types into lineage trees to understand the developmental origin of cells remains challenging. Here we present LINNAEUS (lineage tracing by nuclease-activated editing of ubiquitous sequences)-a strategy for simultaneous lineage tracing and transcriptome profiling in thousands of single cells. By combining scRNA-seq with computational analysis of lineage barcodes, generated by genome editing of transgenic reporter genes, we reconstruct developmental lineage trees in zebrafish larvae, and in heart, liver, pancreas, and telencephalon of adult fish. LINNAEUS provides a systematic approach for tracing the origin of novel cell types, or known cell types under different conditions.	2018-06	2024-03-06 19:56:08	2024-03-06T19:56:08Z		469-473		5	36		Nat Biotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29644996 PMCID: PMC5942543					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Lineage; Cell Tracking; Computational Biology; Gene Editing; Genetic Engineering; Heart; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Liver; Pancreas; Single-Cell Analysis; Telencephalon; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

The function and mechanism of action of most of these helicases in animal development and human disease remain largely unexplored. In a zebrafish mutagenesis screen to identify genes essential for heart development we identified a mutant that disrupts the gene encoding the RNA helicase DEAD-box 39ab (ddx39ab). Homozygous ddx39ab mutant embryos exhibit profound cardiac and trunk muscle dystrophy, along with lens abnormalities, caused by abrupt terminal differentiation of cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Loss of ddx39ab hindered splicing of mRNAs encoding epigenetic regulatory factors, including members of the KMT2 gene family, leading to misregulation of structural gene expression in cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Taken together, these results show that Ddx39ab plays an essential role in establishment of the proper epigenetic status during differentiation of multiple cell lineages.	2018-04-23	2024-03-06 19:56:07	2024-03-06T19:56:07Z		dev161018		8	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29636379					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Knockout Techniques; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Lens; Lens, Crystalline; Muscle Cells; Mutation; Myocyte; Phenotype; RNA Splicing; RNA helicase; RNA splicing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Although the cold responsive lncRNAs have been reported in plants, no data is available on screening and functional prediction of lncRNAs in cold acclimation in fish so far. Here we compared the expression profile of lncRNAs in cold acclimated zebrafish embryonic fibroblast cells (ZF4) cultured at 18°C for 30 days with that of cells cultured at 28°C as control by high-throughput sequencing. Totally 8,363 novel lncRNAs were identified. Including known and novel lncRNAs, there are 347 lncRNAs up-regulated and 342 lncRNAs down-regulated in cold acclimated cells. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 74 and 61 were detected only in control cells or cold-acclimated cells, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of adjacent genes to the differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that the enriched genes are involved in electron transport, cell adhesion, oxidation-reduction process, and so on. We also predicted the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs by looking for interactions between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and constructed an interaction network. In summary, our genome-wide systematic identification and functional prediction of cold responsive lncRNAs in zebrafish cells suggests a crucial role of lincRNAs in cold acclimation in fish.	2018	2024-03-06 19:56:07	2024-03-06T19:56:07Z		e0195468		4	13		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29634734 PMCID: PMC5892903					Acclimatization; Animals; Cold Temperature; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Profiling; RNA, Long Noncoding; Zebrafish

However, it remains largely unknown how maternal mRNA decay is triggered in early vertebrate embryos. Here, through genome-wide profiling of RNA abundance and 3' modification, we show that uridylation is induced at the onset of maternal mRNA clearance. The temporal control of uridylation is conserved in vertebrates. When the homologs of terminal uridylyltransferases TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) are depleted in zebrafish and Xenopus, maternal mRNA clearance is significantly delayed, leading to developmental defects during gastrulation. Short-tailed mRNAs are selectively uridylated by TUT4/7, with the highly uridylated transcripts degraded faster during the MZT than those with unmodified poly(A) tails. Our study demonstrates that uridylation plays a crucial role in timely mRNA degradation, thereby allowing the progression of early development.	2018-04-05	2024-03-06 19:56:06	2024-03-06T19:56:06Z		72-82.e7		1	70		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29625039					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gestational Age; Mice, Inbred ICR; Nucleotidyltransferases; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA Stability; RNA decay; RNA, Messenger; TAIL-seq; TUT4; TUT7; Transcriptome; U tail; Xenopus Proteins; Xenopus laevis; Zcchc11; Zcchc6; Zebrafish; maternal-to-zygotic transition; poly(A) tail; uridylation

However, only a handful of signals associated with aging have been identified. By comparing beta-cells from younger and older zebrafish, here we show that the aging islets exhibit signs of chronic inflammation. These include recruitment of tnfα-expressing macrophages and the activation of NF-kB signaling in beta-cells. Using a transgenic reporter, we show that NF-kB activity is undetectable in juvenile beta-cells, whereas cells from older fish exhibit heterogeneous NF-kB activity. We link this heterogeneity to differences in gene expression and proliferation. Beta-cells with high NF-kB signaling proliferate significantly less compared to their neighbors with low activity. The NF-kB signalinghi cells also exhibit premature upregulation of socs2, an age-related gene that inhibits beta-cell proliferation. Together, our results show that NF-kB activity marks the asynchronous decline in beta-cell proliferation with advancing age.	2018-04-06	2024-03-06 19:56:06	2024-03-06T19:56:06Z		e32965			7		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29624168 PMCID: PMC5943033					Aging; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Diabetes; Gene Expression Profiling; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Insulin-Secreting Cells; NF-kB; NF-kappa B; Signal Transduction; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish; beta-cells; cell biology; pancreas; zebrafish

Here we define a role for the conserved chromatin factor Gon4l, encoded by ugly duckling (udu), in coordinating tissue patterning and axis extension during zebrafish gastrulation through direct positive and negative regulation of gene expression. Although identified as a recessive enhancer of impaired axis extension in planar cell polarity (PCP) mutants, udu functions in a genetically independent, partially overlapping fashion with PCP signaling to regulate mediolateral cell polarity underlying axis extension in part by promoting notochord boundary formation. Gon4l limits expression of the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules EpCAM and Integrinα3b, excesses of which perturb the notochord boundary via tension-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. By promoting formation of this AP-aligned boundary and associated cell polarity, Gon4l cooperates with PCP signaling to coordinate morphogenesis along the AP embryonic axis.	2018-04-03	2024-03-06 19:56:06	2024-03-06T19:56:06Z		1319		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29615614 PMCID: PMC5882663					Animals; Body Patterning; Cell Adhesion; Cell Communication; Chromatin; Crosses, Genetic; Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mutation; Notochord; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Xenopus; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Upon cardiac cryoinjury, collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins accumulate at the injury site. However, in contrast to the situation in mammals, fibrosis is transient in zebrafish and its regression is concomitant with regrowth of the myocardial wall. Little is known about the cells producing this fibrotic tissue or how it resolves. Using novel genetic tools to mark periostin b- and collagen 1alpha2 (col1a2)-expressing cells in combination with transcriptome analysis, we explored the sources of activated fibroblasts and traced their fate. We describe that during fibrosis regression, fibroblasts are not fully eliminated but become inactivated. Unexpectedly, limiting the fibrotic response by genetic ablation of col1a2-expressing cells impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation. We conclude that ECM-producing cells are key players in the regenerative process and suggest that antifibrotic therapies might be less efficient than strategies targeting fibroblast inactivation.	2018-04-17	2024-03-06 19:56:05	2024-03-06T19:56:05Z		4188-4193		16	115		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29610343 PMCID: PMC5910827					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Base Sequence; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Lineage; Cold Temperature; Collagen Type XII; Endocardium; Extracellular Matrix; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Heart; Heart Injuries; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; RNA, Messenger; Regeneration; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiomyocyte proliferation; fibroblast inactivation; fibrosis; heart regeneration; zebrafish

Simultaneous single-cell profiling of lineages and cell types in the vertebrate brain	Nature Biotechnology		1546-1696	10.1038/nbt.4103		The lineage relationships among the hundreds of cell types generated during development are difficult to reconstruct. A recent method, GESTALT, used CRISPR-Cas9 barcode editing for large-scale lineage tracing, but was restricted to early development and did not identify cell types. Here we present scGESTALT, which combines the lineage recording capabilities of GESTALT with cell-type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing. The method relies on an inducible system that enables barcodes to be edited at multiple time points, capturing lineage information from later stages of development. Sequencing of ∼60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain identified >100 cell types and marker genes. Using these data, we generate lineage trees with hundreds of branches that help uncover restrictions at the level of cell types, brain regions, and gene expression cascades during differentiation. scGESTALT can be applied to other multicellular organisms to simultaneously characterize molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease.	2018-06	2024-03-06 19:56:05	2024-03-06T19:56:05Z		442-450		5	36		Nat Biotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29608178 PMCID: PMC5938111					Animals; Brain; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Lineage; Gene Editing; Humans; Mice; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
APMWX4QB	journalArticle	2018	Alemany, Anna; Florescu, Maria; Baron, Chloé S.; Peterson-Maduro, Josi; van Oudenaarden, Alexander	Whole-organism clone tracing using single-cell sequencing	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/nature25969		Embryonic development is a crucial period in the life of a multicellular organism, during which limited sets of embryonic progenitors produce all cells in the adult body. Determining which fate these progenitors acquire in adult tissues requires the simultaneous measurement of clonal history and cell identity at single-cell resolution, which has been a major challenge. Clonal history has traditionally been investigated by microscopically tracking cells during development, monitoring the heritable expression of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and, more recently, using next-generation sequencing technologies that exploit somatic mutations, microsatellite instability, transposon tagging, viral barcoding, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and Cre-loxP recombination. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here we present ScarTrace, a single-cell sequencing strategy that enables the simultaneous quantification of clonal history and cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs of the adult zebrafish. Using ScarTrace, we show that a small set of multipotent embryonic progenitors generate all haematopoietic cells in the kidney marrow, and that many progenitors produce specific cell types in the eyes and brain. In addition, we study when embryonic progenitors commit to the left or right eye. ScarTrace reveals that epidermal and mesenchymal cells in the caudal fin arise from the same progenitors, and that osteoblast-restricted precursors can produce mesenchymal cells during regeneration. Furthermore, we identify resident immune cells in the fin with a distinct clonal origin from other blood cell types. We envision that similar approaches will have major applications in other experimental systems, in which the matching of embryonic clonal origin to adult cell type will ultimately allow reconstruction of how the adult body is built from a single cell.	2018-04-05	2024-03-06 19:56:05	2024-03-06T19:56:05Z		108-112		7699	556		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29590089					Animal Fins; Animals; Brain; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Lineage; Cell Tracking; Clone Cells; Embryonic Stem Cells; Eye; Female; Genes, Reporter; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Male; Multipotent Stem Cells; Organ Specificity; Regeneration; Sequence Analysis; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Whole Body Imaging; Zebrafish

A parental requirement for dual-specificity phosphatase 6 in zebrafish	BMC developmental biology		1471-213X	10.1186/s12861-018-0164-6		BACKGROUND: Signaling cascades, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, play vital roles in early vertebrate development. Signals through these pathways are initiated by a growth factor or hormone, are transduced through a kinase cascade, and result in the expression of specific downstream genes that promote cellular proliferation, growth, or differentiation. Tight regulation of these signals is provided by positive or negative modulators at varying levels in the pathway, and is required for proper development and function. Two members of the dual-specificity phosphatase (Dusp) family, dusp6 and dusp2, are believed to be negative regulators of the ERK pathway and are expressed in both embryonic and adult zebrafish, but their specific roles in embryogenesis remain to be fully understood. RESULTS: Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, we generated zebrafish lines harboring germ line deletions in dusp6 and dusp2. We do not detect any overt defects in dusp2 mutants, but we find that approximately 50% of offspring from homozygous dusp6 mutants do not proceed through embryonic development. These embryos are fertilized, but are unable to proceed past the first zygotic mitosis and stall at the 1-cell stage for several hours before dying by 10 h post fertilization. We demonstrate that dusp6 is expressed in gonads of both male and female zebrafish, suggesting that loss of dusp6 causes defects in germ cell production. Notably, the 50% of homozygous dusp6 mutants that complete the first cell division appear to progress through embryogenesis normally and give rise to fertile adults. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that offspring of homozygous dusp6 mutants stall prior to activation of the zygotic genome, suggests that loss of dusp6 affects gametogenesis and/or parentally-directed early development. Further, since only approximately 50% of homozygous dusp6 mutants are affected, we postulate that ERK signaling is tightly regulated and that dusp6 is required to keep ERK signaling within a range that is permissive for proper embryogenesis. Lastly, since dusp6 is expressed throughout zebrafish embryogenesis, but dusp6 mutants do not exhibit defects after the first cell division, it is possible that other regulators of the ERK pathway compensate for loss of dusp6 at later stages.	2018-03-15	2024-03-06 19:56:04	2024-03-06T19:56:04Z		6		1	18		BMC Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29544468 PMCID: PMC5856328					Alleles; Animals; Base Sequence; CRISPR; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Division; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6; Dual-specific phosphatase; ERK signaling; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Female; Gastrulation; Gene Editing; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Germ Cells; Germ cell development; Homozygote; MAP kinase phosphatase; Male; Morpholinos; Mutation; Ovary; Phenotype; Rhombencephalon; Testis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zebrafish embryonic patterning

Comprehensive Identification and Spatial Mapping of Habenular Neuronal Types Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq	Current biology: CB		1879-0445	10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.040		The identification of cell types and marker genes is critical for dissecting neural development and function, but the size and complexity of the brain has hindered the comprehensive discovery of cell types. We combined single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with anatomical brain registration to create a comprehensive map of the zebrafish habenula, a conserved forebrain hub involved in pain processing and learning. Single-cell transcriptomes of ∼13,000 habenular cells with 4× cellular coverage identified 18 neuronal types and dozens of marker genes. Registration of marker genes onto a reference atlas created a resource for anatomical and functional studies and enabled the mapping of active neurons onto neuronal types following aversive stimuli. Strikingly, despite brain growth and functional maturation, cell types were retained between the larval and adult habenula. This study provides a gene expression atlas to dissect habenular development and function and offers a general framework for the comprehensive characterization of other brain regions.	2018-04-02	2024-03-06 19:56:04	2024-03-06T19:56:04Z		1052-1065.e7		7	28		Curr Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29576475 PMCID: PMC6042852					Animals; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Habenula; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Larva; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; adult; habenula; in situ atlas; larva; neuronal types; single-cell RNA-seq; transcriptomes; zebrafish

Low incubation temperature during early development negatively affects survival and related innate immune processes in zebrafish larvae exposed to lipopolysaccharide	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-018-22288-8		In many fish species, the immune system is significantly constrained by water temperature. In spite of its critical importance in protecting the host against pathogens, little is known about the influence of embryonic incubation temperature on the innate immunity of fish larvae. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were incubated at 24, 28 or 32 °C until first feeding. Larvae originating from each of these three temperature regimes were further distributed into three challenge temperatures and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a full factorial design (3 incubation × 3 challenge temperatures). At 24 h post LPS challenge, mortality of larvae incubated at 24 °C was 1.2 to 2.6-fold higher than those kept at 28 or 32 °C, regardless of the challenge temperature. LPS challenge at 24 °C stimulated similar immune-related processes but at different levels in larvae incubated at 24 or 32 °C, concomitantly with the down-regulation of some chemokine and lysozyme transcripts in the former group. Larvae incubated at 24 °C and LPS-challenged at 32 °C exhibited a limited immune response with up-regulation of hypoxia and oxidative stress processes. Annexin A2a, S100 calcium binding protein A10b and lymphocyte antigen-6, epidermis were identified as promising candidates for LPS recognition and signal transduction.	2018-03-07	2024-03-06 19:56:04	2024-03-06T19:56:04Z		4142		1	8		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29515182 PMCID: PMC5841277					Animals; Cold Temperature; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Immunity, Innate; Lipopolysaccharides; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Identification of transcripts potentially involved in neural tube closure using RNA sequencing	Genesis (New York, N.Y.: 2000)		1526-968X	10.1002/dvg.23096		Anencephaly is a fatal human neural tube defect (NTD) in which the anterior neural tube remains open. Zebrafish embryos with reduced Nodal signaling display an open anterior neural tube phenotype that is analogous to anencephaly. Previous work from our laboratory suggests that Nodal signaling acts through induction of the head mesendoderm and mesoderm. Head mesendoderm/mesoderm then, through an unknown mechanism, promotes formation of the polarized neuroepithelium that is capable of undergoing the movements required for closure. We compared the transcriptome of embryos treated with a Nodal signaling inhibitor at sphere stage, which causes NTDs, to embryos treated at 30% epiboly, which does not cause NTDs. This screen identified over 3,000 transcripts with potential roles in anterior neurulation. Expression of several genes encoding components of tight and adherens junctions was significantly reduced, supporting the model that Nodal signaling regulates formation of the neuroepithelium. mRNAs involved in Wnt, FGF, and BMP signaling were also differentially expressed, suggesting these pathways might regulate anterior neurulation. In support of this, we found that pharmacological inhibition of FGF-receptor function causes an open anterior NTD as well as loss of mesodermal derivatives. This suggests that Nodal and FGF signaling both promote anterior neurulation through induction of head mesoderm.	2018-03	2024-03-06 19:56:03	2024-03-06T19:56:03Z		e23096		3	56		Genesis								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29488319 PMCID: PMC6616371					Animals; Biomarkers; Body Patterning; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Models, Biological; Neural Tube; Neural Tube Defects; Phenotype; RNA sequencing; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; neural tube defects; neurulation; nodal; zebrafish

By contrast, highly complementary miRNA-binding sites within viral and artificially engineered transcripts induce miRNA degradation in vitro and in cell lines. Here, we show that a genome-encoded transcript harboring a near-perfect and deeply conserved miRNA-binding site for miR-29 controls zebrafish and mouse behavior. This transcript originated in basal vertebrates as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and evolved to the protein-coding gene NREP in mammals, where the miR-29-binding site is located within the 3' UTR. We show that the near-perfect miRNA site selectively triggers miR-29b destabilization through 3' trimming and restricts its spatial expression in the cerebellum. Genetic disruption of the miR-29 site within mouse Nrep results in ectopic expression of cerebellar miR-29b and impaired coordination and motor learning. Thus, we demonstrate an endogenous target-RNA-directed miRNA degradation event and its requirement for animal behavior.	2018-03	2024-03-06 19:56:03	2024-03-06T19:56:03Z		244-251		3	25		Nat Struct Mol Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29483647					Animals; Anxiety; Behavior, Animal; Binding Sites; Brain; Cerebellum; Mice; MicroRNAs; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Zebrafish

Here, we show that, prior to centra formation, the outer epithelial cell layer of the zebrafish notochord, the sheath, segments into alternating domains corresponding to the prospective centra and IVD areas. This process occurs sequentially in an anteroposterior direction via the activation of Notch signaling in alternating segments of the sheath, which transition from cartilaginous to mineralizing domains. Subsequently, osteoblasts are recruited to the mineralized domains of the notochord sheath to form mature centra. Tissue-specific manipulation of Notch signaling in sheath cells produces notochord segmentation defects that are mirrored in the spine. Together, our findings demonstrate that notochord sheath segmentation provides a template for vertebral patterning in the zebrafish spine.	2018-02-20	2024-03-06 19:56:02	2024-03-06T19:56:02Z		2026-2038		8	22		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29466731 PMCID: PMC5860813					Animals; Body Patterning; Cartilage; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Morphogenesis; Notch; Notochord; Osteoblasts; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Somites; Spine; Zebrafish; and zebrafish; intervertebral disc; notochord sheath; segmentation; spine; vertebrae

Much less, however, is known about how Ezh2 acts in live zebrafish. Here, we show that zebrafish ezh2 is regulated directly by the circadian clock via both E-box and RORE motif, while core circadian clock genes per1a, per1b, cry1aa and cry1ab are down-regulated in ezh2 null mutant and ezh2 morphant zebrafish, and either knockdown or overexpression of ezh2 alters locomotor rhythms, indicating that Ezh2 is required for zebrafish circadian regulation. In contrast to its canonical silencing function, zebrafish Ezh2 up-regulates these key circadian clock genes independent of histone methyltransferase activity by directly binding to key circadian clock proteins. Similarly, Ezh2 contributes to hematopoiesis by enhancing expression of hematopoietic genes such as cmyb and lck. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Ezh2 acts in both circadian regulation and hematopoiesis independent of silencing PRC2.	2018-04-20	2024-03-06 19:56:02	2024-03-06T19:56:02Z		3382-3399		7	46		Nucleic Acids Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29447387 PMCID: PMC5909462					Animals; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins; E-Box Elements; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck); Period Circadian Proteins; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Placeholder Nucleosomes Underlie Germline-to-Embryo DNA Methylation Reprogramming	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.022		The fate and function of epigenetic marks during the germline-to-embryo transition is a key issue in developmental biology, with relevance to stem cell programming and transgenerational inheritance. In zebrafish, DNA methylation patterns are programmed in transcriptionally quiescent cleavage embryos; paternally inherited patterns are maintained, whereas maternal patterns are reprogrammed to match the paternal. Here, we provide the mechanism by demonstrating that "Placeholder" nucleosomes, containing histone H2A variant H2A.Z(FV) and H3K4me1, virtually occupy all regions lacking DNA methylation in both sperm and cleavage embryos and reside at promoters encoding housekeeping and early embryonic transcription factors. Upon genome-wide transcriptional onset, genes with Placeholder become either active (H3K4me3) or silent (H3K4me3/K27me3). Notably, perturbations causing Placeholder loss confer DNA methylation accumulation, whereas acquisition/expansion of Placeholder confers DNA hypomethylation and improper gene activation. Thus, during transcriptionally quiescent gametic and embryonic stages, an H2A.Z(FV)/H3K4me1-containing Placeholder nucleosome deters DNA methylation, poising parental genes for either gene-specific activation or facultative repression.	2018-02-22	2024-03-06 19:56:02	2024-03-06T19:56:02Z		993-1006.e13		5	172		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29456083					Animals; Cellular Reprogramming; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Germ Cells; H2A.Z; Histones; Male; Mutation; Nucleosomes; Spermatozoa; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; germline-to-embryo transition; zebrafish; zygotic genome activation

Disruptions in these pathways can cause severe congenital cardiac malformations or functional defects. To better understand these pathways and how they regulate cardiac development we used tomo-seq, combining high-throughput RNA-sequencing with tissue-sectioning, to establish a genome-wide expression dataset with high spatial resolution for the developing zebrafish heart. Analysis of the dataset revealed over 1100 genes differentially expressed in sub-compartments. Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial region induce heart contractions, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying their development. Using our transcriptome map, we identified spatially restricted Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in pacemaker cells, which was controlled by Islet-1 activity. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls heart rate by regulating pacemaker cellular response to parasympathetic stimuli. Thus, this high-resolution transcriptome map incorporating all cell types in the embryonic heart can expose spatially restricted molecular pathways critical for specific cardiac functions.	2018-02-05	2024-03-06 19:56:01	2024-03-06T19:56:01Z		e31515			7		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29400650 PMCID: PMC5815850					Animals; Heart; Heart Rate; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Islet-1; RNA-seq; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; beta Catenin; developmental biology; heart; pacemaker; stem cells; wnt; zebrafish

Secreted growth factors such as FGFs, IGF, PDGFs and Neuregulin play essential roles in stimulating cardiomyocyte proliferation. These factors activate the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is tightly controlled by the feedback attenuator Dual specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6), an ERK phosphatase. Here, we show that suppressing Dusp6 function enhances cardiac regeneration. Inactivation of Dusp6 by small molecules or by gene inactivation increased cardiomyocyte proliferation, coronary angiogenesis, and reduced fibrosis after ventricular resection. Inhibition of Erbb or PDGF receptor signaling suppressed cardiac regeneration in wild-type zebrafish, but had a milder effect on regeneration in dusp6 mutants. Moreover, in rat primary cardiomyocytes, NRG1-stimulated proliferation can be enhanced upon chemical inhibition of Dusp6 with BCI. Our results suggest that Dusp6 attenuates Ras/MAPK signaling during regeneration and that suppressing Dusp6 can enhance cardiac repair.	2018-03-06	2024-03-06 19:56:01	2024-03-06T19:56:01Z		dev157206		5	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29444893 PMCID: PMC5868992					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cardiac repair; Cardiomyocyte proliferation; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6; Dual specificity phosphatase 6; Heart; Heart regeneration; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Myocytes, Cardiac; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Ras/MAPK signaling; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcripts within rod photoreceptors of the Zebrafish retina	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-018-4499-y		BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify transcripts of retinal rod photoreceptors of the zebrafish. The zebrafish is an important animal model for vision science due to rapid and tractable development, persistent neurogenesis of rods throughout the lifespan, and capacity for functional retinal regeneration. RESULTS: Zebrafish rods, and non-rod retinal cells of the xops:eGFP transgenic line, were separated by cell dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by RNA-seq. At a false discovery rate of < 0.01, 597 transcripts were upregulated ("enriched") in rods vs. other retinal cells, and 1032 were downregulated ("depleted"). Thirteen thousand three hundred twenty four total transcripts were detected in rods, including many not previously known to be expressed by rods. Forty five transcripts were validated by qPCR in FACS-sorted rods vs. other retinal cells. Transcripts enriched in rods from adult retinas were also enriched in rods from larval and juvenile retinas, and were also enriched in rods sorted from retinas subjected to a neurotoxic lesion and allowed to regenerate.

RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of adult zebrafish inner ear hair cells	Scientific Data		2052-4463	10.1038/sdata.2018.5		Although hair cells are the sensory receptors of the auditory and vestibular systems in the ears of all vertebrates, hair cell properties are different between non-mammalian vertebrates and mammals. To understand the basic biological properties of hair cells from non-mammalian vertebrates, we examined the transcriptome of adult zebrafish auditory and vestibular hair cells. GFP-labeled hair cells were isolated from inner-ear sensory epithelia of a pou4f3 promoter-driven GAP-GFP line of transgenic zebrafish. One thousand hair cells and 1,000 non-sensory surrounding cells (nsSCs) were separately collected for each biological replicate, using the suction pipette technique. RNA sequencing of three biological replicates for the two cell types was performed and analyzed. Comparisons between hair cells and nsSCs allow identification of enriched genes in hair cells, which may underlie hair cell specialization. Our dataset provides an extensive resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying morphology, function, and pathology of adult zebrafish hair cells. It also establishes a framework for future characterization of genes expressed in hair cells and the study of hair cell evolution.	2018-02-06	2024-03-06 19:56:01	2024-03-06T19:56:01Z		180005			5		Sci Data								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29406519 PMCID: PMC5800389					Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner; RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Coordination of olfactory receptor choice with guidance receptor expression and function in olfactory sensory neurons	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007164		Olfactory sensory neurons choose to express a single odorant receptor (OR) from a large gene repertoire and extend axons to reproducible, OR-specific locations within the olfactory bulb. This developmental process produces a topographically organized map of odorant experience in the brain. The axon guidance mechanisms that generate this pattern of connectivity, as well as those that coordinate OR choice and axonal guidance receptor expression, are incompletely understood. We applied the powerful approach of single-cell RNA-seq on newly born olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in young zebrafish larvae to address these issues. Expression profiles were generated for 56 individual Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP) positive sensory neurons by single-cell (SC) RNA-seq. We show that just as in mouse OSNs, mature zebrafish OSNs typically express a single predominant OR transcript. Our previous work suggests that OSN targeting is related to the OR clade from which a sensory neuron chooses to express its odorant receptor. We categorized each of the mature cells based on the clade of their predominantly expressed OR. Transcripts expressed at higher levels in each of three clade-related categories were identified using Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). A genome-wide approach was used to identify membrane-associated proteins that are most likely to have guidance-related activity. We found that OSNs that choose to express an OR from a particular clade also express specific subsets of potential axon guidance genes and transcription factors. We validated our identification of candidate axon guidance genes for one clade of OSNs using bulk RNA-seq from a subset of transgene-labeled neurons that project to a single protoglomerulus. The differential expression patterns of selected candidate guidance genes were confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Most importantly, we observed axonal mistargeting in knockouts of three candidate axonal guidance genes identified in this analysis: nrp1a, nrp1b, and robo2. In each case, targeting errors were detected in the subset of axons that normally express these transcripts at high levels, and not in the axons that express them at low levels. Our findings demonstrate that specific, functional, axonal guidance related genes are expressed in subsets of OSNs that that can be categorized by their patterns of OR expression.	2018-01	2024-03-06 19:56:00	2024-03-06T19:56:00Z		e1007164		1	14		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29385124 PMCID: PMC5809090					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Axons; Cell Differentiation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Developmental; Nerve Net; Neurogenesis; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Marker Protein; Olfactory Mucosa; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Receptors, Odorant; Sensory Receptor Cells; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

DEHP, along with other phthalates causes endocrine disruption in males. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals has been linked to the development of several adverse health outcomes with apical end points including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This study examined the adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) transcriptome after exposure to environmental levels of DEHP and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) using both DNA microarray and RNA-sequencing technologies. Our results show that exposure to DEHP is associated with differentially expressed (DE) transcripts associated with the disruption of metabolic processes in the liver, including perturbation of five biological pathways: 'FOXA2 and FOXA3 transcription factor networks', 'Metabolic pathways', 'metabolism of amino acids and derivatives', 'metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins', and 'fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism'. DE transcripts unique to DEHP exposure, not observed with EE2 (i.e. non-estrogenic effects) exhibited a signature related to the regulation of transcription and translation, and ruffle assembly and organization. Collectively our results indicate that exposure to low DEHP levels modulates the expression of liver genes related to fatty acid metabolism and the development of NAFLD.	2018-02-01	2024-03-06 19:56:00	2024-03-06T19:56:00Z		2118		1	8		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29391432 PMCID: PMC5794889					Animals; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Gene Expression Regulation; Liver; Male; Plasticizers; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The contribution of FHF and SHF progenitors to the adult zebrafish heart has not been studied to date. Here we find, using genetic tbx5a lineage tracing tools, that the ventricular myocardium in the adult zebrafish is mainly derived from tbx5a+ cells, with a small contribution from tbx5a- SHF progenitors. Notably, ablation of ventricular tbx5a+-derived cardiomyocytes in the embryo is compensated by expansion of SHF-derived cells. In the adult, tbx5a expression is restricted to the trabeculae and excluded from the outer cortical layer. tbx5a-lineage tracing revealed that trabecular cardiomyocytes can switch their fate and differentiate into cortical myocardium during adult heart regeneration. We conclude that a high degree of cardiomyocyte cell fate plasticity contributes to efficient regeneration.	2018-01-30	2024-03-06 19:55:59	2024-03-06T19:55:59Z		428		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29382818 PMCID: PMC5789846					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Tracking; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Heart Ventricles; Luminescent Proteins; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Myosin Light Chains; Organogenesis; Red Fluorescent Protein; Regeneration; Stem Cells; T-Box Domain Proteins; Zebrafish

Nevertheless, it has remained unclear to what extent molecular signatures of ageing reflect this phenomenon. Here we report on the identification of a conserved transcriptomic signature of ageing based on gene expression data from four vertebrate species across four tissues. We find that ageing-associated transcriptomic changes follow trajectories similar to the transcriptional alterations observed in degenerative ageing diseases but are in opposite direction to the transcriptomic alterations observed in cancer. We confirm the existence of a similar antagonism on the genomic level, where a majority of shared risk alleles which increase the risk of cancer decrease the risk of chronic degenerative disorders and vice versa. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between cancer and degenerative ageing diseases that sheds light on the pronounced shift in their epidemiology during ageing.	2018-01-30	2024-03-06 19:55:59	2024-03-06T19:55:59Z		327		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29382830 PMCID: PMC5790807					Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Animals; Brain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Diabetes Mellitus; Fundulidae; Gene Ontology; Genome, Human; Humans; Infant; Liver; Mice; Middle Aged; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Neoplasms; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Skin; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Inorganic arsenic causes fatty liver and interacts with ethanol to cause alcoholic liver disease in zebrafish	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.031575		The rapid increase in fatty liver disease (FLD) incidence is attributed largely to genetic and lifestyle factors; however, environmental toxicants are a frequently overlooked factor that can modify the effects of more common causes of FLD. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is associated with liver disease in humans and animal models, but neither the mechanism of action nor the combinatorial interaction with other disease-causing factors has been fully investigated. Here, we examined the contribution of iAs to FLD using zebrafish and tested the interaction with ethanol to cause alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We report that zebrafish exposed to iAs throughout development developed specific phenotypes beginning at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf), including the development of FLD in over 50% of larvae by 5 dpf. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of livers from larvae exposed to either iAs or ethanol revealed the oxidative stress response and the unfolded protein response (UPR) caused by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as common pathways in both these models of FLD, suggesting that they target similar cellular processes. This was confirmed by our finding that arsenic is synthetically lethal with both ethanol and a well-characterized ER-stress-inducing agent (tunicamycin), suggesting that these exposures work together through UPR activation to cause iAs toxicity. Most significantly, combined exposure to sub-toxic concentrations of iAs and ethanol potentiated the expression of UPR-associated genes, cooperated to induce FLD, reduced the expression of as3mt, which encodes an arsenic-metabolizing enzyme, and significantly increased the concentration of iAs in the liver. This demonstrates that iAs exposure is sufficient to cause FLD and that low doses of iAs can potentiate the effects of ethanol to cause liver disease.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.	2018-02-26	2024-03-06 19:55:58	2024-03-06T19:55:58Z		dmm031575		2	11		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29361514 PMCID: PMC5894941					Animals; Arsenic; Disease Susceptibility; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Environmental exposure; Ethanol; Fatty Liver; Fatty liver disease; Larva; Liver; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Models, Biological; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

The bones of the lower but not upper jaw form around an early-developing cartilage template. Whereas Endothelin1 patterns the lower jaw, the factors that specify upper-jaw morphology remain elusive. Here, we identify Nuclear Receptor 2f genes (Nr2fs) as enriched in and required for upper-jaw formation in zebrafish. Combinatorial loss of Nr2fs transforms maxillary components of the upper jaw into lower-jaw-like structures. Conversely, nr2f5 misexpression disrupts lower-jaw development. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Nr2fs repress mandibular gene expression and early chondrogenesis in maxillary precursors. Rescue of lower-jaw defects in endothelin1 mutants by reducing Nr2f dosage further demonstrates that Nr2f expression must be suppressed for normal lower-jaw development. We propose that Nr2fs shape the upper jaw by protecting maxillary progenitors from early chondrogenesis, thus preserving cells for later osteogenesis.	2018-02-05	2024-03-06 19:55:58	2024-03-06T19:55:58Z		337-347.e5		3	44		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29358039 PMCID: PMC5801120					Animals; Body Patterning; COUP-TF; Chondrogenesis; DNA-Binding Proteins; Endothelin-1; Endothelin1; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Jaw; Maxilla; Mutation; Nr2f1; Nr2f2; Nr2f5; Odontogenesis; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; bone; cartilage; jaw; nuclear receptor; pharyngeal arches

Complement Receptor C5aR1 Plays an Evolutionarily Conserved Role in Successful Cardiac Regeneration	Circulation		1524-4539	10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030801		BACKGROUND: Defining conserved molecular pathways in animal models of successful cardiac regeneration could yield insight into why adult mammals have inadequate cardiac regeneration after injury. Insight into the transcriptomic landscape of early cardiac regeneration from model organisms will shed light on evolutionarily conserved pathways in successful cardiac regeneration. METHODS: Here we describe a cross-species transcriptomic screen in 3 model organisms for cardiac regeneration: axolotl, neonatal mice, and zebrafish. Apical resection to remove ≈10% to 20% of ventricular mass was carried out in these model organisms. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on the hearts harvested at 3 time points: 12, 24, and 48 hours after resection. Sham surgery was used as internal control. RESULTS: Genes associated with inflammatory processes were found to be upregulated in a conserved manner. Complement receptors (activated by complement components, part of the innate immune system) were found to be highly upregulated in all 3 species. This approach revealed induction of gene expression for complement 5a receptor 1 in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and mice. Inhibition of complement 5a receptor 1 significantly attenuated the cardiomyocyte proliferative response to heart injury in all 3 species. Furthermore, after left ventricular apical resection, the cardiomyocyte proliferative response was diminished in mice with genetic deletion of complement 5a receptor 1. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that activation of complement 5a receptor 1 mediates an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation after cardiac injury and identify complement pathway activation as a common pathway of successful heart regeneration.	2018-05-15	2024-03-06 19:55:57	2024-03-06T19:55:57Z		2152-2165		20	137		Circulation								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29348261 PMCID: PMC5953786					Ambystoma mexicanum; Animals; Animals, Newborn; C5aR1; Cell Proliferation; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Heart; Mice; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Peptides, Cyclic; RNA; Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a; Regeneration; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Troponin T; Zebrafish; axolotl; cardiac regeneration; complement system; cross-species; mice; zebrafish

Thomas	MYC Drives a Subset of High-Risk Pediatric Neuroblastomas and Is Activated through Mechanisms Including Enhancer Hijacking and Focal Enhancer Amplification	Cancer Discovery		2159-8290	10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-0993		The amplified MYCN gene serves as an oncogenic driver in approximately 20% of high-risk pediatric neuroblastomas. Here, we show that the family member MYC is a potent transforming gene in a separate subset of high-risk neuroblastoma cases (∼10%), based on (i) its upregulation by focal enhancer amplification or genomic rearrangements leading to enhancer hijacking, and (ii) its ability to transform neuroblastoma precursor cells in a transgenic animal model. The aberrant regulatory elements associated with oncogenic MYC activation include focally amplified distal enhancers and translocation of highly active enhancers from other genes to within topologically associating domains containing the MYC gene locus. The clinical outcome for patients with high levels of MYC expression is virtually identical to that of patients with amplification of the MYCN gene, a known high-risk feature of this disease. Together, these findings establish MYC as a bona fide oncogene in a clinically significant group of high-risk childhood neuroblastomas.Significance: Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is a recognized hallmark of high-risk pediatric neuroblastoma. Here, we demonstrate that MYC is also activated as a potent oncogene in a distinct subset of neuroblastoma cases through either focal amplification of distal enhancers or enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocation.

The molecular mechanisms regulating these complex processes are still largely unknown. We show that the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators Yap1 and Wwtr1 are specifically localized to the presumptive epidermis and notochord, and play a critical and unexpected role in posterior body extension by regulating Fibronectin assembly underneath the presumptive epidermis and surrounding the notochord. We further find that Yap1 and Wwtr1, also via Fibronectin, have an essential role in the epidermal morphogenesis necessary to form the initial dorsal and ventral fins, a process previously thought to involve bending of an epithelial sheet, but which we now show involves concerted active cell movement. Our results reveal how the Hippo pathway transcriptional program, localized to two specific tissues, acts to control essential morphological events in the vertebrate embryo.	2017-12-28	2024-03-06 19:55:56	2024-03-06T19:55:56Z		e31065			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29283341 PMCID: PMC5773182					Animals; Epidermis; Fibronectin; Fibronectins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hippo pathway; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Morphogenesis; Notochord; Trans-Activators; Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; fin formation; morphogenesis; stem cells; vertebrate embryo elongation; zebrafish

This is especially critical during embryogenesis, when extensive cell proliferation, patterning, and migration events take place. Here we show that vertebrate primordial germ cells (PGCs) are protected from reprogramming into other cell types by the RNA-binding protein Dead end (Dnd). PGCs knocked down for Dnd lose their characteristic morphology and adopt various somatic cell fates. Concomitantly, they gain a gene expression profile reflecting differentiation into cells of different germ layers, in a process that we could direct by expression of specific cell-fate determinants. Importantly, we visualized these events within live zebrafish embryos, which provide temporal information regarding cell reprogramming. Our results shed light on the mechanisms controlling germ cell fate maintenance and are relevant for the formation of teratoma, a tumor class composed of cells from more than one germ layer.	2017-12-18	2024-03-06 19:55:55	2024-03-06T19:55:55Z		704-715.e5		6	43		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29257950					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cellular Reprogramming Techniques; Dead end; Endoderm; Germ Cells; In Situ Hybridization; PGC; RNA-Binding Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; differentiation; germ cell; nanos; pluripotency; reprogramming; teratoma; zebrafish

Female reproductive impacts of dietary methylmercury in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)	Chemosphere		1879-1298	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.029		The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of environmentally relevant dietary MeHg exposures on adult female yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovarian development and reproduction. Yellow perch were used in the study for their socioeconomic and ecological importance within the Great Lakes basin, and the use of zebrafish allowed for a detailed analysis of the molecular effects of MeHg following a whole life-cycle exposure. Chronic whole life dietary exposure of F1 zebrafish to MeHg mimics realistic wildlife exposure scenarios, and the twenty-week adult yellow perch exposure (where whole life-cycle exposures are difficult) captures early seasonal ovarian development. For both species, target dietary accumulation values were achieved prior to analyses. In zebrafish, several genes involved in reproductive processes were shown to be dysregulated by RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), but no significant phenotypic changes were observed regarding ovarian staging, fecundity, or embryo mortality. Yellow perch were exposed to dietary MeHg for 12, 16, or 20 weeks. In this species, a set of eight genes were assessed by QPCR in the pituitary, liver, and ovary, and no exposure-related changes were observed. The lack of genomic resources in yellow perch hinders the characterization of subtle molecular impacts. The ovarian somatic index, circulating estradiol and testosterone, and ovarian staging were not significantly altered by MeHg exposure in yellow perch. These results suggest that environmentally relevant MeHg exposures do not drastically reduce the reproductively important endpoints in these fish, but to capture realistic exposure scenarios, whole life-cycle yellow perch exposures are needed.	2018-03	2024-03-06 19:55:55	2024-03-06T19:55:55Z		301-311			195		Chemosphere								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29272799 PMCID: PMC8846966					Animals; Aquatic toxicology; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Female; Lakes; Liver; Methylmercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Ovary; Perches; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproduction; Reproductive toxicity; Transcriptomics; Yellow perch; Zebrafish

Mammalian Rfx4 controls neural tube morphogenesis via both mechanisms. RESULTS: We set out to identify conserved aspects of rfx4 gene function during vertebrate development and to establish a new genetic model in which to analyze these mechanisms further. To this end, we have generated frame-shift alleles in the zebrafish rfx4 locus using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. Using RNAseq-based transcriptome analysis, in situ hybridization and immunostaining we identified a requirement for zebrafish rfx4 in the forming midlines of the caudal neural tube. These functions are mediated, least in part, through transcriptional regulation of several zic genes in the dorsal hindbrain and of foxa2 in the ventral hindbrain and spinal cord (floor plate). CONCLUSIONS: The midline patterning functions of rfx4 are conserved, because rfx4 regulates transcription of foxa2 and zic2 in zebrafish and in mouse. In contrast, zebrafish rfx4 function is dispensable for forebrain morphogenesis, while mouse rfx4 is required for normal formation of forebrain ventricles in a ciliogenesis-dependent manner. Collectively, this report identifies conserved aspects of rfx4 function and establishes a robust new genetic model for in-depth dissection of these mechanisms.

These maternal mRNAs undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation (CPA), suggesting translational control of their activation. To elucidate the biological role of CPA during embryogenesis, we performed genome-wide polysome profiling at several stages of zebrafish development. Our analysis revealed a correlation between CPA and polysome-association dynamics, demonstrating a coupling of translation to the CPA of maternal mRNAs. Pan-embryonic CPA inhibition disrupted the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), causing a failure of developmental progression beyond the mid-blastula transition and changes in global gene expression that indicated a failure of ZGA and maternal mRNA clearance. Among the genes that were differentially expressed were those encoding chromatin modifiers and key transcription factors involved in ZGA, including nanog, pou5f3 and sox19b, which have distinct CPA dynamics. Our results establish the necessity of CPA for ensuring progression of the MZT. The RNA-seq data generated in this study represent a valuable zebrafish resource for the discovery of novel elements of the early embryonic transcriptome.	2018-01-08	2024-03-06 19:53:51	2024-03-06T19:53:51Z		dev159566		1	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29229769					Animals; Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic polyadenylation; Female; Maternal mRNA; Maternal-to-zygotic transition; Polyadenylation; Polysome profiling; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Translational regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote																																																																																																																																				
YAQYQLN7	journalArticle	2017	Zhang, Liyun; Zhang, Xinlian; Zhang, Gaonan; Pang, Chi Pui; Leung, Yuk Fai; Zhang, Mingzhi; Zhong, Wenxuan	Expression profiling of the retina of pde6c, a zebrafish model of retinal degeneration	Scientific Data		2052-4463	10.1038/sdata.2017.182		Retinal degeneration often affects the whole retina even though the disease-causing gene is specifically expressed in the light-sensitive photoreceptors. The molecular basis of the retinal defect can potentially be determined by gene-expression profiling of the whole retina. In this study, we measured the gene-expression profile of retinas microdissected from a zebrafish pde6cw59 (pde6c) mutant. This retinal-degeneration model not only displays cone degeneration caused by a cone-specific mutation, but also other secondary cellular changes starting from 4 days postfertilization (dpf). To capture the underlying molecular changes, we subjected pde6c and wild-type (WT) retinas at 5 dpf/ 120 h postfertilization (hpf) to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the Illumina HiSeq 2,000 platform. We also validated the RNA-Seq results by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) of seven phototransduction genes. Our analyses indicate that the RNA-Seq dataset was of high quality, and effectively captured the molecular changes in the whole pde6c retina. This dataset will facilitate the characterization of the molecular defects in the pde6c retina at the initial stage of retinal degeneration.	2017-12-12	2024-03-06 19:53:51	2024-03-06T19:53:51Z		170182			4		Sci Data								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29231925 PMCID: PMC5726315					Animals; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6; Microarray Analysis; Retina; Retinal Degeneration; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the molecular mechanisms that control follicle development, particularly the early phase of follicle activation or recruitment, still remain poorly understood. In an attempt to decipher the gene networks and signaling pathways involved in such transition, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) on zebrafish primary growth (PG, stage I; inactive) and previtellogenic (PV, stage II; activated) follicles. A total of 118 unique microRNAs (miRNAs) (11 downregulated and 83 upregulated during PG/PV transition) and 56711 unique messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1839 downregulated and 7243 upregulated during PG/PV transition) were identified. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed differential expression of 46 miRNAs from 66 candidates (66.67%). Among which, we chose to focus on 13 miRNAs (let-7a, -7b, -7c-5p, -7d-5p, -7h, -7i; miR-21, -23a-3p, -27c-3p, -107a-3p, -125b-5p, -145-3p, and -202-5p) that exhibited significant differential expression between PG and PV follicles (P ≤ 0.045*). With this 13-miRNA expression signature alone, PG follicles can be well differentiated from PV follicles by hierarchical clustering, suggesting their functional relevance during PG-to-PV transition. By overlaying predicted target genes and the differentially expressed mRNAs revealed by the RNA-seq analysis, especially those showing reciprocal miRNA-mRNA expression patterns, we shortlisted a panel of miRNA downstream targets for luciferase reporter validation. The reporter assay confirmed the interactions of let-7i:: atg4a (P = 0.01*), miR-202-5p::c23h20orf24 (P = 0.0004***), and miR-144-5p::ybx1 (P = 0.003**), implicating these potential miRNA-mRNA gene pairs in follicle activation during folliculogenesis. Our transcriptomic data analyses suggest that miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control may represent an important mechanism underlying follicle activation.	2018-01-01	2024-03-06 19:53:50	2024-03-06T19:53:50Z		42-53		1	98		Biol Reprod								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29228146					Animals; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; HEK293 Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Ovarian Follicle; RNA, Messenger; Zebrafish; folliculogenesis; microRNA; ovary; zebrafish

A Massively Parallel Reporter Assay of 3' UTR Sequences Identifies In Vivo Rules for mRNA Degradation	Molecular Cell		1097-4164	10.1016/j.molcel.2017.11.014		The stability of mRNAs is regulated by signals within their sequences, but a systematic and predictive understanding of the underlying sequence rules remains elusive. Here we introduce UTR-seq, a combination of massively parallel reporter assays and regression models, to survey the dynamics of tens of thousands of 3' UTR sequences during early zebrafish embryogenesis. UTR-seq revealed two temporal degradation programs: a maternally encoded early-onset program and a late-onset program that accelerated degradation after zygotic genome activation. Three signals regulated early-onset rates: stabilizing poly-U and UUAG sequences and destabilizing GC-rich signals. Three signals explained late-onset degradation: miR-430 seeds, AU-rich sequences, and Pumilio recognition sites. Sequence-based regression models translated 3' UTRs into their unique decay patterns and predicted the in vivo effect of sequence signals on mRNA stability. Their application led to the successful design of artificial 3' UTRs that conferred specific mRNA dynamics. UTR-seq provides a general strategy to uncover the rules of RNA cis regulation.	2017-12-21	2024-03-06 19:53:50	2024-03-06T19:53:50Z		1083-1094.e5		6	68		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29225039 PMCID: PMC5994907					3' Untranslated Regions; 3′; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; MicroRNAs; RNA Stability; RNA degradation; RNA stability regulation; RNA, Messenger; UTR; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote; massively parallel reporter assay; maternal to zygotic transition

Here, we investigated its age-associated cardiac function. We observed oxidative stress accumulation and an engagement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the aging heart. MiRNA-sequencing of 5 week (young), 12-21 week (adult) and 28-40 week (old) Nfu hearts revealed 23 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated miRNAs with age. MiR-29 family turned out as one of the most up-regulated miRNAs during aging. MiR-29 family increase induces a decrease of known targets like collagens and DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) paralleled by 5´methyl-cytosine (5mC) level decrease. To further investigate miR-29 family role in the fish heart we generated a transgenic zebrafish model where miR-29 was knocked-down. In this model we found significant morphological and functional cardiac alterations and an impairment of oxygen dependent pathways by transcriptome analysis leading to hypoxic marker up-regulation. To get insights the possible hypoxic regulation of miR-29 family, we exposed human cardiac fibroblasts to 1% O2 levels. In hypoxic condition we found miR-29 down-modulation responsible for the accumulation of collagens and 5mC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-29 family up-regulation might represent an endogenous mechanism aimed at ameliorating the age-dependent cardiac damage leading to hypertrophy and fibrosis.	2017-12-04	2024-03-06 19:53:49	2024-03-06T19:53:49Z		16839		1	7		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29203887 PMCID: PMC5715159					5-Methylcytosine; Aging; Animals; Antagomirs; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line; Collagen; DNA Methylation; Echocardiography; Fibroblasts; Fishes; Heart; Humans; MicroRNAs; Myocardium; Oxidative Stress; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish

Ligand-activated BMP signaling inhibits cell differentiation and death to promote melanoma	The Journal of Clinical Investigation		1558-8238	10.1172/JCI92513		Oncogenomic studies indicate that copy number variation (CNV) alters genes involved in tumor progression; however, identification of specific driver genes affected by CNV has been difficult, as these rearrangements are often contained in large chromosomal intervals among several bystander genes. Here, we addressed this problem and identified a CNV-targeted oncogene by performing comparative oncogenomics of human and zebrafish melanomas. We determined that the gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), which is the ligand for the BMP family, is recurrently amplified and transcriptionally upregulated in melanoma. GDF6-induced BMP signaling maintained a trunk neural crest gene signature in melanomas. Additionally, GDF6 repressed the melanocyte differentiation gene MITF and the proapoptotic factor SOX9, thereby preventing differentiation, inhibiting cell death, and promoting tumor growth. GDF6 was specifically expressed in melanomas but not melanocytes. Moreover, GDF6 expression levels in melanomas were inversely correlated with patient survival. Our study has identified a fundamental role for GDF6 and BMP signaling in governing an embryonic cell gene signature to promote melanoma progression, thus providing potential opportunities for targeted therapy to treat GDF6-positive cancers.	2018-01-02	2024-03-06 19:53:49	2024-03-06T19:53:49Z		294-308		1	128		J Clin Invest								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29202482 PMCID: PMC5749509					Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cancer; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Development; Female; Growth Differentiation Factor 6; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Ligands; Melanoma; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Neoplasm Proteins; Oncology; Signal Transduction

Thus, unraveling how molecular tools are recruited in different lineages to control interplays between these tissues is key to understanding morphogenetic evolution. Here, we study Esrp genes, which regulate extensive splicing programs and are essential for mammalian organogenesis. We find that Esrp homologs have been independently recruited for the development of multiple structures across deuterostomes. Although Esrp is involved in a wide variety of ontogenetic processes, our results suggest ancient roles in non-neural ectoderm and regulating specific mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions in deuterostome ancestors. However, consistent with the extensive rewiring of Esrp-dependent splicing programs between phyla, most developmental defects observed in vertebrate mutants are related to other types of morphogenetic processes. This is likely connected to the origin of an event in Fgfr, which was recruited as an Esrp target in stem chordates and subsequently co-opted into the development of many novel traits in vertebrates.	2017-11-27	2024-03-06 19:53:48	2024-03-06T19:53:48Z		1799		1	8		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29180615 PMCID: PMC5703972					Animals; Biological Evolution; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Embryonic Development; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Exons; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Lancelets; Male; Mutation; RNA Splicing; RNA-Binding Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Signal Transduction; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; Urochordata; Zebrafish

The primary role of zebrafish nanog is in extra-embryonic tissue	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.147793		The role of the zebrafish transcription factor Nanog has been controversial. It has been suggested that Nanog is primarily required for the proper formation of the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL) and only indirectly regulates gene expression in embryonic cells. In an alternative scenario, Nanog has been proposed to directly regulate transcription in embryonic cells during zygotic genome activation. To clarify the roles of Nanog, we performed a detailed analysis of zebrafish nanog mutants. Whereas zygotic nanog mutants survive to adulthood, maternal-zygotic (MZnanog) and maternal mutants exhibit developmental arrest at the blastula stage. In the absence of Nanog, YSL formation and epiboly are abnormal, embryonic tissue detaches from the yolk, and the expression of dozens of YSL and embryonic genes is reduced. Epiboly defects can be rescued by generating chimeric embryos of MZnanog embryonic tissue with wild-type vegetal tissue that includes the YSL and yolk cell. Notably, cells lacking Nanog readily respond to Nodal signals and when transplanted into wild-type hosts proliferate and contribute to embryonic tissues and adult organs from all germ layers. These results indicate that zebrafish Nanog is necessary for proper YSL development but is not directly required for embryonic cell differentiation.	2018-01-09	2024-03-06 19:53:48	2024-03-06T19:53:48Z		dev147793		1	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29180571 PMCID: PMC5825865					Animals; Cell Differentiation; GESTALT; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Lineage tracing; MZT; Maternal-to-zygotic transition; Mutation; Nanog; Nanog Homeobox Protein; YSL; Yolk Sac; Yolk syncytial layer; ZGA; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygotic genome activation

Cohesin facilitates zygotic genome activation in zebrafish	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.156521		At zygotic genome activation (ZGA), changes in chromatin structure are associated with new transcription immediately following the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The nuclear architectural proteins cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) contribute to chromatin structure and gene regulation. We show here that normal cohesin function is important for ZGA in zebrafish. Depletion of the cohesin subunit Rad21 delays ZGA without affecting cell cycle progression. In contrast, CTCF depletion has little effect on ZGA, whereas complete abrogation is lethal. Genome-wide analysis of Rad21 binding reveals a change in distribution from pericentromeric satellite DNA and other locations, including the miR-430 locus (the products of which are responsible for maternal transcript degradation), to genes, as embryos progress through the MZT. After MZT, a subset of Rad21 binding overlaps the pioneer factor Pou5f3, which activates early expressed genes. Rad21 depletion disrupts the formation of nucleoli and RNA polymerase II foci, suggestive of global defects in chromosome architecture. We propose that Rad21/cohesin redistribution to active areas of the genome is key to the establishment of chromosome organization and the embryonic developmental program.	2018-01-03	2024-03-06 19:53:47	2024-03-06T19:53:47Z		dev156521		1	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29158440					Animals; CCCTC-Binding Factor; CTCF; Cell Cycle Proteins; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Cohesin; Cohesins; Genome; Genome-Wide Association Study; MicroRNAs; Mid-blastula transition; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote; Zygotic genome activation

Temporal regulation of these steps lies at the heart of the regenerative process, yet its basis is not well understood. The ability of zebrafish to dedifferentiate mature "post-mitotic" myocytes into proliferating myoblasts that in turn regenerate lost muscle tissue provides an opportunity to probe the molecular mechanisms of regeneration. RESULTS: Following subtotal excision of adult zebrafish lateral rectus muscle, dedifferentiating residual myocytes were collected at two time points prior to cell cycle reentry and compared to uninjured muscles using RNA-seq. Functional annotation (GAGE or K-means clustering followed by GO enrichment) revealed a coordinated response encompassing epigenetic regulation of transcription, RNA processing, and DNA replication and repair, along with protein degradation and translation that would rewire the cellular proteome and metabolome. Selected candidate genes were phenotypically validated in vivo by morpholino knockdown. Rapidly induced gene products, such as the Polycomb group factors Ezh2 and Suz12a, were necessary for both efficient dedifferentiation (i.e. cell reprogramming leading to cell cycle reentry) and complete anatomic regeneration. In contrast, the late activated gene fibronectin was important for efficient anatomic muscle regeneration but not for the early step of myocyte cell cycle reentry. CONCLUSIONS: Reprogramming of a "post-mitotic" myocyte into a dedifferentiated myoblast requires a complex coordinated effort that reshapes the cellular proteome and rewires metabolic pathways mediated by heritable yet nuanced epigenetic alterations and molecular switches, including transcription factors and non-coding RNAs. Our studies show that temporal regulation of gene expression is programmatically linked to distinct steps in the regeneration process, with immediate early expression driving dedifferentiation and reprogramming, and later expression facilitating anatomical regeneration.	2017-11-09	2024-03-06 19:53:47	2024-03-06T19:53:47Z		854		1	18		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29121865 PMCID: PMC5680785					Animals; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell reprogramming; Chromatin; Epigenetic; Fibronectin; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Muscle Cells; Muscle Development; Muscles; Polycomb; RNA-sequencing; Regeneration; Stem cell; Time Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Toddler signaling regulates mesodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.22626		Toddler/Apela/Elabela is a conserved secreted peptide that regulates mesendoderm development during zebrafish gastrulation. Two non-exclusive models have been proposed to explain Toddler function. The 'specification model' postulates that Toddler signaling enhances Nodal signaling to properly specify endoderm, whereas the 'migration model' posits that Toddler signaling regulates mesendodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling. Here, we test key predictions of both models. We find that in toddler mutants Nodal signaling is initially normal and increasing endoderm specification does not rescue mesendodermal cell migration. Mesodermal cell migration defects in toddler mutants result from a decrease in animal pole-directed migration and are independent of endoderm. Conversely, endodermal cell migration defects are dependent on a Cxcr4a-regulated tether of the endoderm to mesoderm. These results suggest that Toddler signaling regulates mesodermal cell migration downstream of Nodal signaling and indirectly affects endodermal cell migration via Cxcr4a-signaling.	2017-11-09	2024-03-06 19:53:47	2024-03-06T19:53:47Z		e22626			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29117894 PMCID: PMC5679751					Animals; Apela; Cell Movement; Cxcr4a; Elabela; Gastrulation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Mesoderm; Nodal; Nodal Signaling Ligands; Receptors, CXCR4; Signal Transduction; Toddler; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; stem cells; zebrafish

Epigenetic factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are key regulators of gene expression during cancer. The effect of BPA exposure on the zebrafish epigenome remains poorly characterized. Zebrafish represents an excellent model to study cancer as the organism develops a disease that resembles human cancer. Using zebrafish as a systems toxicology model, we hypothesized that chronic BPA-exposure impacts the miRNome in adult zebrafish and establishes an epigenome more susceptible to cancer development. After a 3 week exposure to 100 nM BPA, RNA from the liver was extracted to perform high throughput mRNA and miRNA sequencing. Differential expression (DE) analyses comparing BPA-exposed to control specimens were performed using established bioinformatics pipelines. In the BPA-exposed liver, 6188 mRNAs and 15 miRNAs were differently expressed (q ≤ 0.1). By analyzing human orthologs of the DE zebrafish genes, signatures associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell cycle were uncovered. Chronic exposure to BPA has a significant impact on the liver miRNome and transcriptome in adult zebrafish with the potential to cause adverse health outcomes including cancer.	2017-10-13	2024-03-06 19:53:46	2024-03-06T19:53:46Z		269		10	8		Genes (Basel)	The Plasticizer Bisphenol A Perturbs the Hepatic Epigenome							eng					PubMed		PMID: 29027980 PMCID: PMC5664119					bioinformatics; bisphenol A; epigenome; microRNAs; toxicology; zebrafish

We examined the link between the cardiac phenotypes associated with hace1 loss of function to the expression of the Rho small family GTPase, rac1, which is a known target of HACE1 and promotes ROS production via its interaction with NADPH oxidase holoenzymes. RESULTS: We demonstrate that loss of hace1 in zebrafish via morpholino knockdown results in cardiac deformities, specifically a looping defect, where the heart is either tubular or "inverted". Whole-mount in situ hybridization of cardiac markers shows distinct abnormalities in ventricular morphology and atrioventricular valve formation in the hearts of these morphants, as well as increased expression of rac1. Importantly, this phenotype appears to be directly related to Nox enzyme-dependent ROS production, as both genetic inhibition by nox1 and nox2 morpholinos or pharmacologic rescue using ROS scavenging agents restores normal cardiac structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that HACE1 is critical in the normal development and proper function of the vertebrate heart via a ROS-dependent mechanism.

Olfactory sensory axons target specific protoglomeruli in the olfactory bulb of zebrafish	Neural Development		1749-8104	10.1186/s13064-017-0095-0		BACKGROUND: The axons of Olfactory Sensory Neurons (OSNs) project to reproducible target locations within the Olfactory Bulb (OB), converting odorant experience into a spatial map of neural activity. We characterized the initial targeting of OSN axons in the zebrafish, a model system suitable for studying axonal targeting early in development. In this system the initial targets of OSN axons are a small number of distinct, individually identifiable neuropilar regions called protoglomeruli. Previously, Olfactory Marker Protein-expressing and TRPC2-expressing classes of OSNs were shown to project to specific, non-overlapping sets of protoglomeruli, indicating that particular subsets of OSNs project to specific protoglomerular targets. We set out to map the relationship between the classical Odorant Receptor (OR) an OSN chooses to express and the protoglomerulus its axon targets. METHODS: A panel of BACs were recombineered so that the axons of OSNs choosing to express modified ORs were fluorescently labeled. Axon projections were followed into the olfactory bulb to determine the protoglomeruli in which they terminated. RESULTS: RNA-seq demonstrates that OSNs express a surprisingly wide variety of ORs and Trace Amine Associated Receptors (TAARs) very early when sensory axons are arriving in the bulb. Only a single OR is expressed in any given OSN even at these early developmental times. We used a BAC expression technique to map the trajectories of OSNs expressing specific odorant receptors. ORs can be divided into three clades based upon their sequence similarities. OSNs expressing ORs from two of these clades project to the CZ protoglomerulus, while OSNs expressing ORs from the third clade project to the DZ protoglomerulus. In contrast, OSNs expressing a particular TAAR project to multiple protoglomeruli. Neither OR choice nor axonal targeting are related to the position an OSN occupies within the olfactory pit. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that it is not the choice of a particular OR, but of one from a category of ORs, that is related to initial OSN target location within the olfactory bulb. These choices are not related to OSN position within the olfactory epithelium.	2017-10-11	2024-03-06 19:53:45	2024-03-06T19:53:45Z		18		1	12		Neural Dev								eng					PubMed		PMID: 29020985 PMCID: PMC5637265					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Axon guidance; Axons; Neurogenesis; OSN targeting; Odorant map; Odorant receptor; Olfaction; Olfactory; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Olfactory bulb; Olfactory sensory neuron; Protoglomerulus; Zebrafish

Mecp2 regulates tnfa during zebrafish embryonic development and acute inflammation	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.026922		Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome, a severe neurological disorder with autism-like features. Duplication of MECP2 also causes severe neuropathology. Both diseases display immunological abnormalities that suggest a role for MECP2 in controlling immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we used mecp2-null zebrafish to study the potential function of Mecp2 as an immunological regulator. Mecp2 deficiency resulted in an increase in neutrophil infiltration and upregulated expression of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines Il1b and Il10 as a secondary response to disturbances in tissue homeostasis. By contrast, expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) was consistently downregulated in mecp2-null animals during development, representing the earliest developmental phenotype described for MECP2 deficiency to date. Expression of tnfa was unresponsive to inflammatory stimulation, and was partially restored by re-expression of functional mecp2 Thus, Mecp2 is required for tnfa expression during zebrafish development and inflammation. Finally, RNA sequencing of mecp2-null embryos revealed dysregulated processes predictive for Rett syndrome phenotypes.	2017-12-19	2024-03-06 19:53:45	2024-03-06T19:53:45Z		1439-1451		12	10		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28993314 PMCID: PMC5769600					Animals; Embryonic Development; Gastrointestinal Tract; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Larva; Leukocyte Count; Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2; Neutrophils; Phenotype; Rett Syndrome; Rett syndrome; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Zebrafish; mecp2; tnfa

We recently demonstrated that developmental exposure of zebrafish to low, nonembryotoxic levels of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) did not affect larval behavior, but caused changes in adult behavior. The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying molecular basis for adult behavioral phenotypes resulting from early life exposure to PCB126. We exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 during early development and measured transcriptional profiles in whole embryos, larvae and adult male brains using RNA-sequencing. Early life exposure to 0.3 nM PCB126 induced cyp1a transcript levels in 2-dpf embryos, but not in 5-dpf larvae, suggesting transient activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor with this treatment. No significant induction of cyp1a was observed in the brains of adults exposed as embryos to PCB126. However, a total of 2209 and 1628 genes were differentially expressed in 0.3 and 1.2 nM PCB126-exposed groups, respectively. KEGG pathway analyses of upregulated genes in the brain suggest enrichment of calcium signaling, MAPK and notch signaling, and lysine degradation pathways. Calcium is an important signaling molecule in the brain and altered calcium homeostasis could affect neurobehavior. The downregulated genes in the brain were enriched with oxidative phosphorylation and various metabolic pathways, suggesting that the metabolic capacity of the brain is impaired. Overall, our results suggest that PCB exposure during sensitive periods of early development alters normal development of the brain by reprogramming gene expression patterns, which may result in alterations in adult behavior.	2017-12-01	2024-03-06 19:53:44	2024-03-06T19:53:44Z		386-397		2	160		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28973690 PMCID: PMC5837202					Age Factors; Animals; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Cellular Reprogramming; DOHaD; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Environmental Pollutants; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; RNAseq; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Time Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; brain; latent effects; males; zebrafish

Characterization of Triptolide-Induced Hepatotoxicity by Imaging and Transcriptomics in a Novel Zebrafish Model	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfx144		Triptolide is a vine extract used in traditional Chinese medicines and associated with hepatotoxicity. In vitro data suggest that inhibition of RNA synthesis may be the mechanism of toxicity. For studying drug-induced liver injury the zebrafish has experimental, practical and financial advantages compared with rodents. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of triptolide toxicity using zebrafish as the model system. The effect of triptolide exposure on zebrafish larvae was determined with regard to mortality, histology, expression of liver specific microRNA-122 and liver volume. Fluorescent microscopy was used to track toxicity in the Tg(-2.8lfabp:GFP)as3 zebrafish line. Informed by microscopy, RNA-sequencing was used to explore the mechanism of toxicity. Triptolide exposure resulted in dose-dependent mortality, a reduction in the number of copies of microRNA-122 per larva, hepatocyte vacuolation, disarray and oncotic necrosis, and a reduction in liver volume. These findings were consistent across replicate experiments. Time-lapse imaging indicated the onset of injury was 6 h after the start of exposure, at which point, RNA-sequencing revealed that 88% of genes were down-regulated. Immune response associated genes were up-regulated in the triptolide-treated larvae including nitric oxide synthase. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase increased mortality. Triptolide induces hepatotoxicity in zebrafish larvae. This represents a new model of drug-induced liver injury that complements rodents. RNA sequencing, guided by time-lapse microscopy, revealed early down-regulation of genes consistent with previous invitro studies, and facilitated the discovery of mechanistic inflammatory pathways.	2017-10-01	2024-03-06 19:53:44	2024-03-06T19:53:44Z		380-391		2	159		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28962522 PMCID: PMC5837554					Animals; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Disease Models, Animal; Diterpenes; Epoxy Compounds; Larva; Liver; MicroRNAs; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Phenanthrenes; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; hepatotoxicity; imaging; microRNA-122; nitric oxide synthase; triptolide; zebrafish

We, therefore, elected to take advantage of the zebrafish model organism to study the SR genes' functions using the splicing morpholino (sMO) microinjection and the programmable site-specific nucleases. Consistent with previous research, we revealed discrepancies between the mutant and morphant phenotypes and we show that these inconsistencies may result from a large number of unsuspected inadvertent morpholino RNA targets. While microinjection of MOs directed against srsf5a (sMOsrsf5a) led to developmental defects, the corresponding homozygous mutants did not display any phenotypic traits. Furthermore, microinjection of sMOsrsf5a into srsf5a-/- led to the previously observed morphant phenotype. Similar findings were observed for other SR genes. sMOsrsf5a alternative target genes were identified using deep mRNA sequencing. We uncovered that only 11 consecutive bases complementary to sMOsrsf5a are sufficient for binding and subsequent blocking of splice sites. In addition, we observed that sMOsrsf5a secondary targets can be reduced by increasing embryos growth temperature after microinjection. Our data contribute to the debate about MO specificity, efficacy and the number of unknown targeted sequences.	2017-09-19	2024-03-06 19:53:43	2024-03-06T19:53:43Z		9547-9557		16	45		Nucleic Acids Res	Number of inadvertent RNA targets for morpholino knockdown in Danio rerio is largely underestimated							eng					PubMed		PMID: 28934490 PMCID: PMC5766196					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Microinjections; Morpholinos; RNA Splice Sites; Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Primary Spinal OPC Culture System from Adult Zebrafish to Study Oligodendrocyte Differentiation In Vitro	Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience		1662-5102	10.3389/fncel.2017.00284		Endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are a promising target to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) by remyelinating denuded, and therefore vulnerable, axons. Demyelination is the result of a primary insult and secondary injury, leading to conduction blocks and long-term degeneration of the axons, which subsequently can lead to the loss of their neurons. In response to SCI, dormant OPCs can be activated and subsequently start to proliferate and differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). Therefore, researchers strive to control OPC responses, and utilize small molecule screening approaches in order to identify mechanisms of OPC activation, proliferation, migration and differentiation. In zebrafish, OPCs remyelinate axons of the optic tract after lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced demyelination back to full thickness myelin sheaths. In contrast to zebrafish, mammalian OPCs are highly vulnerable to excitotoxic stress, a cause of secondary injury, and remyelination remains insufficient. Generally, injury induced remyelination leads to shorter internodes and thinner myelin sheaths in mammals. In this study, we show that myelin sheaths are lost early after a complete spinal transection injury, but are re-established within 14 days after lesion. We introduce a novel, easy-to-use, inexpensive and highly reproducible OPC culture system based on dormant spinal OPCs from adult zebrafish that enables in vitro analysis. Zebrafish OPCs are robust, can easily be purified with high viability and taken into cell culture. This method enables to examine why zebrafish OPCs remyelinate better than their mammalian counterparts, identify cell intrinsic responses, which could lead to pro-proliferating or pro-differentiating strategies, and to test small molecule approaches. In this methodology paper, we show efficient isolation of OPCs from adult zebrafish spinal cord and describe culture conditions that enable analysis up to 10 days in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that zebrafish OPCs differentiate into Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-expressing OLs when co-cultured with human motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This shows that the basic mechanisms of oligodendrocyte differentiation are conserved across species and that understanding the regulation of zebrafish OPCs can contribute to the development of new treatments to human diseases.	2017	2024-03-06 19:53:43	2024-03-06T19:53:43Z		284			11		Front Cell Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28959189 PMCID: PMC5603699					OL; OPC; adult zebrafish; human motor neuron; oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; primary OPC culture; remyelination; spinal cord injury

Removal of the vegetal yolk in the zebrafish fertilised egg before the completion of the first cleavage results in embryonic ventralisation, but removal of this part at the two-cell stage leads to embryonic dorsalisation. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we report a novel mode of maternal regulation of BMP signalling during dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish. We identify Vrtn as a novel vegetally localised maternal factor with dorsalising activity and rapid transport towards the animal pole region after fertilisation. Co-injection of vrtn mRNA with vegetal RNAs from different cleavage stages suggests the presence of putative vegetally localised Vrtn antagonists with slower animal pole transport. Thus, vegetal ablation at the two-cell stage could remove most of the Vrtn antagonists, and allows Vrtn to produce the dorsalising effect. Mechanistically, Vrtn binds a bmp2b regulatory sequence and acts as a repressor to inhibit its zygotic transcription. Analysis of maternal-zygotic vrtn mutants further shows that Vrtn is required to constrain excessive bmp2b expression in the margin. Our work unveils a novel maternal mechanism regulating zygotic BMP gradient in dorsoventral patterning.	2017-09-15	2024-03-06 19:53:42	2024-03-06T19:53:42Z		3361-3374		18	144		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28928283					Animals; BMP signalling; Base Sequence; Bmp2b; Body Patterning; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; COS Cells; Chlorocebus aethiops; Dorsoventral patterning; Egg Yolk; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Models, Biological; Mutation; Protein Binding; RNA, Messenger; Repressor Proteins; Transcription, Genetic; Vegetal maternal determinants; Vrtn; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

Tet-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation regulates retinal neurogenesis by modulating cell-extrinsic signaling pathways	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006987		DNA hydroxymethylation has recently been shown to play critical roles in regulating gene expression and terminal differentiation events in a variety of developmental contexts. However, little is known about its function during eye development. Methylcytosine dioxygenases of the Tet family convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an epigenetic mark thought to serve as a precursor for DNA demethylation and as a stable mark in neurons. Here, we report a requirement for Tet activity during zebrafish retinal neurogenesis. In tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutants, retinal neurons are specified but most fail to terminally differentiate. While differentiation of the first born retinal neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is less affected in tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutants than other retinal cell types, the majority of RGCs do not undergo terminal morphogenesis and form axons. Moreover, the few photoreceptors that differentiate in tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutants fail to form outer segments, suggesting that Tet function is also required for terminal morphogenesis of differentiated retinal neurons. Mosaic analyses revealed a surprising cell non-autonomous requirement for tet2 and tet3 activity in facilitating retinal neurogenesis. Through a combination of candidate gene analysis, transcriptomics and pharmacological manipulations, we identified the Notch and Wnt pathways as cell-extrinsic pathways regulated by tet2 and tet3 activity during RGC differentiation and morphogenesis. Transcriptome analyses also revealed the ectopic expression of non-retinal genes in tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutant retinae, and this correlated with locus-specific reduction in 5hmC. These data provide the first evidence that Tet-dependent regulation of 5hmC formation is critical for retinal neurogenesis, and highlight an additional layer of complexity in the progression from retinal progenitor cell to differentiated retinal neuron during development of the vertebrate retina.	2017-09	2024-03-06 19:53:42	2024-03-06T19:53:42Z		e1006987		9	13		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28926578 PMCID: PMC5621703					5-Methylcytosine; Animals; Axons; Cell Differentiation; DNA Methylation; Dioxygenases; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Receptors, Notch; Retina; Transcriptome; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In this study, we developed somatically mutated tumor models using TALEN-mediated somatic gene inactivation of cdkn2a/b or rb1 tumor suppressor genes in zebrafish. One-cell stage injection of cdkn2a/b-TALEN mRNA resulted in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with high frequency (about 39%) and early onset (about 35 weeks of age) in F0 tp53e7/e7 mutant zebrafish. Injection of rb1-TALEN mRNA also led to the formation of brain tumors at high frequency (58%, 31 weeks of age) in F0 tp53e7/e7 mutant zebrafish. Analysis of each tumor induced by somatic inactivation showed that the targeted genes had bi-allelic mutations. Tumors induced by rb1 somatic inactivation were characterized as medulloblastoma-like primitive neuroectodermal tumors based on incidence location, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical tests. In addition, 3' mRNA Quanti-Seq analysis showed differential activation of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, and protein synthesis; especially, genes involved in neuronal development were up-regulated.	2017-08-15	2024-03-06 19:53:42	2024-03-06T19:53:42Z		55280-55297		33	8		Oncotarget								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28903419 PMCID: PMC5589658					MPNST; PNET; TALEN; medulloblastoma; somatic inactivation

Dissecting hematopoietic and renal cell heterogeneity in adult zebrafish at single-cell resolution using RNA sequencing	The Journal of Experimental Medicine		1540-9538	10.1084/jem.20170976		Recent advances in single-cell, transcriptomic profiling have provided unprecedented access to investigate cell heterogeneity during tissue and organ development. In this study, we used massively parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and functionally distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful in characterizing immune-cell deficiencies within DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit (prkdc), interleukin-2 receptor γ a (il2rga), and double-homozygous-mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants. Our analysis also uncovered novel cell types, including two classes of natural killer immune cells, classically defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mucin-secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor cells. In total, our work provides the first, comprehensive, single-cell, transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish.	2017-10-02	2024-03-06 19:53:41	2024-03-06T19:53:41Z		2875-2887		10	214		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28878000 PMCID: PMC5626406					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Lineage; Gene Expression Profiling; Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Kidney; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Although the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled insight into the biological functions of m6A modification, the function of m6A during vertebrate embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we show that m6A determines cell fate during the endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) to specify the earliest haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) during zebrafish embryogenesis. m6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with sequencing (miCLIP-seq) analyses reveal conserved features on zebrafish m6A methylome and preferential distribution of m6A peaks near the stop codon with a consensus RRACH motif. In mettl3-deficient embryos, levels of m6A are significantly decreased and emergence of HSPCs is blocked. Mechanistically, we identify that the delayed YTHDF2-mediated mRNA decay of the arterial endothelial genes notch1a and rhoca contributes to this deleterious effect. The continuous activation of Notch signalling in arterial endothelial cells of mettl3-deficient embryos blocks EHT, thereby repressing the generation of the earliest HSPCs. Furthermore, knockdown of Mettl3 in mice confers a similar phenotype. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the critical function of m6A modification in the fate determination of HSPCs during vertebrate embryogenesis.	2017-09-14	2024-03-06 19:53:41	2024-03-06T19:53:41Z		273-276		7671	549		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28869969					Adenosine; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Codon, Terminator; Consensus Sequence; Endothelial Cells; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Homeodomain Proteins; Immunoprecipitation; Methylation; Methyltransferases; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Receptor, Notch1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Myofibril structure and function have been extensively studied, but the molecular processes regulating its formation within the differentiating muscle cell remain largely unknown. Here we show in zebrafish that genetic interference with the Quaking RNA-binding proteins disrupts the initial steps of myofibril assembly without affecting early muscle differentiation. Using RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that Quaking is required for accumulation of the muscle-specific tropomyosin-3 transcript, tpm3.12. Further functional analyses reveal that Tpm3.12 mediates Quaking control of myofibril formation. Moreover, we identified a Quaking-binding site in the 3' UTR of tpm3.12 transcript, which is required in vivo for tpm3.12 accumulation and myofibril formation. Our work uncovers a Quaking/Tpm3 pathway controlling de novo myofibril assembly. This unexpected developmental role for Tpm3 could be at the origin of muscle defects observed in human congenital myopathies associated with tpm3 mutation.	2017-09-11	2024-03-06 19:53:40	2024-03-06T19:53:40Z		527-541.e4		5	42		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28867488					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Binding Sites; Cell Differentiation; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Muscle Cells; Muscle Development; Myofibrils; Myosins; Quaking; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; RNA-binding protein; Sarcomeres; Somites; Tropomyosin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; embryo; muscle; myofibril; tropomyosin; zebrafish

Genomic dissection of conserved transcriptional regulation in intestinal epithelial cells	PLoS biology		1545-7885	10.1371/journal.pbio.2002054		The intestinal epithelium serves critical physiologic functions that are shared among all vertebrates. However, it is unknown how the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying these functions have changed over the course of vertebrate evolution. We generated genome-wide mRNA and accessible chromatin data from adult intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human species to determine if conserved IEC functions are achieved through common transcriptional regulation. We found evidence for substantial common regulation and conservation of gene expression regionally along the length of the intestine from fish to mammals and identified a core set of genes comprising a vertebrate IEC signature. We also identified transcriptional start sites and other putative regulatory regions that are differentially accessible in IECs in all 4 species. Although these sites rarely showed sequence conservation from fish to mammals, surprisingly, they drove highly conserved IEC expression in a zebrafish reporter assay. Common putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) found at these sites in multiple species indicate that sequence conservation alone is insufficient to identify much of the functionally conserved IEC regulatory information. Among the rare, highly sequence-conserved, IEC-specific regulatory regions, we discovered an ancient enhancer upstream from her6/HES1 that is active in a distinct population of Notch-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium. Together, these results show how combining accessible chromatin and mRNA datasets with TFBS prediction and in vivo reporter assays can reveal tissue-specific regulatory information conserved across 420 million years of vertebrate evolution. We define an IEC transcriptional regulatory network that is shared between fish and mammals and establish an experimental platform for studying how evolutionarily distilled regulatory information commonly controls IEC development and physiology.	2017-08	2024-03-06 19:53:40	2024-03-06T19:53:40Z		e2002054		8	15		PLoS Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28850571 PMCID: PMC5574553					Animals; California; Colon; Duodenum; Female; Fish Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genomics; Humans; Ileum; Intestinal Mucosa; Jejunum; Larva; Male; Mice; Organ Specificity; RNA, Messenger; Rivers; Smegmamorpha; Species Specificity; Zebrafish

Ikk2 is one of the two critical kinases that regulate the NFκB signaling pathway. While the role of Ikk2 in immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis has received attention, an understanding of the role of Ikk2 in vertebrate development has been compounded by the embryonic lethality seen in mice lacking Ikk2. We find that despite abnormal angiogenesis in IKK2 zygotic mutants of zebrafish, the maternal activity of Ikk2 supports embryogenesis and maturation of fertile animals and allows to study the role of IKK2 in development. Maternal-zygotic ikk2 mutants represent the first vertebrates globally devoid of maternal and zygotic Ikk2 activity. They are defective in cell proliferation as evidenced by abnormal cytokinesis, nuclear enlargement and syncytialisation of a significant portion of blastoderm. We further document that reduced phosphorylation of Aurora A by Ikk2 could underlie the basis of these defects in cell division.	2017-08-14	2024-03-06 19:53:39	2024-03-06T19:53:39Z		8094		1	7		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28808254 PMCID: PMC5556003					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Division; Cell Proliferation; Cytokinesis; Embryonic Development; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; I-kappa B Kinase; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Vertebrates; Zebrafish

Here, we characterize zebrafish caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) and identify an important cellular and molecular mechanism of HSPC expansion. Time-lapse imaging showed that HSPCs localize adjacent to vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and their migration and expansion display caudal vein-specific orientation in the CHT. RNA sequencing and functional analysis identified that an EC-expressed transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 6a (Klf6a), is essential for the CHT niche. We further demonstrated that Klf6a directly regulates the expression of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 25b to modulate HSPC lodgment and proliferation. Ex vivo culture results support the conserved role of Ccl21/Ccr7 signaling in promoting HSPC expansion in mammals. Together, we identify the Klf6a-Ccl25b/Ccr7 axis in controlling the complex HSPC-CHT niche interaction, which may be applicable to in vitro expansion or engraftment of HSPCs after transplantation.	2017-08-21	2024-03-06 19:53:39	2024-03-06T19:53:39Z		349-362.e4		4	42		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28803829					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chemokines, CC; Endothelial Cells; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Receptors, CCR7; Stem Cell Niche; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; caudal hematopoietic tissue; ccl25b; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; klf6a; niche

Lef1-dependent hypothalamic neurogenesis inhibits anxiety	PLoS biology		1545-7885	10.1371/journal.pbio.2002257		While innate behaviors are conserved throughout the animal kingdom, it is unknown whether common signaling pathways regulate the development of neuronal populations mediating these behaviors in diverse organisms. Here, we demonstrate that the Wnt/ß-catenin effector Lef1 is required for the differentiation of anxiolytic hypothalamic neurons in zebrafish and mice, although the identity of Lef1-dependent genes and neurons differ between these 2 species. We further show that zebrafish and Drosophila have common Lef1-dependent gene expression in their respective neuroendocrine organs, consistent with a conserved pathway that has diverged in the mouse. Finally, orthologs of Lef1-dependent genes from both zebrafish and mouse show highly correlated hypothalamic expression in marmosets and humans, suggesting co-regulation of 2 parallel anxiolytic pathways in primates. These findings demonstrate that during evolution, a transcription factor can act through multiple mechanisms to generate a common behavioral output, and that Lef1 regulates circuit development that is fundamentally important for mediating anxiety in a wide variety of animal species.	2017-08	2024-03-06 19:53:39	2024-03-06T19:53:39Z		e2002257		8	15		PLoS Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28837622 PMCID: PMC5570277					Animals; Anxiety; Behavior, Animal; Biomarkers; Drosophila Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Hypothalamus; Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1; Male; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Species Specificity; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Robust Identification of Developmentally Active Endothelial Enhancers in Zebrafish Using FANS-Assisted ATAC-Seq	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2017.06.070		Identification of tissue-specific and developmentally active enhancers provides insights into mechanisms that control gene expression during embryogenesis. However, robust detection of these regulatory elements remains challenging, especially in vertebrate genomes. Here, we apply fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) followed by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to identify developmentally active endothelial enhancers in the zebrafish genome. ATAC-seq of nuclei from Tg(fli1a:egfp)y1 transgenic embryos revealed expected patterns of nucleosomal positioning at transcriptional start sites throughout the genome and association with active histone modifications. Comparison of ATAC-seq from GFP-positive and -negative nuclei identified more than 5,000 open elements specific to endothelial cells. These elements flanked genes functionally important for vascular development and that displayed endothelial-specific gene expression. Importantly, a majority of tested elements drove endothelial gene expression in zebrafish embryos. Thus, FANS-assisted ATAC-seq using transgenic zebrafish embryos provides a robust approach for genome-wide identification of active tissue-specific enhancer elements.	2017-07-18	2024-03-06 19:53:38	2024-03-06T19:53:38Z		709-720		3	20		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28723572 PMCID: PMC5562042					ATAC-seq; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Nucleus; Endothelium; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Zebrafish; endothelial; enhancer; zebrafish

In this study we utilise biotagging, a novel genome-wide profiling approach based on cell type-specific in vivo biotinylation in zebrafish to analyse the initial response of neutrophils to Mycobacterium marinum, a close genetic relative of M. tuberculosis used to model tuberculosis. Differential expression analysis following nuclear RNA-seq of neutrophil active transcriptomes reveals a significant upregulation in both damage-sensing and effector components of the inflammasome, including caspase b, NLRC3 ortholog (wu: fb15h11) and il1β. Crispr/Cas9-mediated knockout of caspase b, which acts by proteolytic processing of il1β, results in increased bacterial burden and less infiltration of macrophages to sites of mycobacterial infection, thus impairing granuloma development. We also show that a number of immediate early response genes (IEGs) are responsible for orchestrating the initial neutrophil response to mycobacterial infection. Further perturbation of the IEGs exposes egr3 as a key transcriptional regulator controlling il1β transcription.	2017-07-26	2024-03-06 19:53:38	2024-03-06T19:53:38Z		6505		1	7		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28747644 PMCID: PMC5529371					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Immunity, Innate; Inflammasomes; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Neutrophils; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Histological and transcriptomic effects of 17α-methyltestosterone on zebrafish gonad development	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-017-3915-z		BACKGROUND: Sex hormones play important roles in teleost ovarian and testicular development. In zebrafish, ovarian differentiation appears to be dictated by an oocyte-derived signal via Cyp19a1a aromatase-mediated estrogen production. Androgens and aromatase inhibitors can induce female-to-male sex reversal, however, the mechanisms underlying gonadal masculinisation are poorly understood. We used histological analyses together with RNA sequencing to characterise zebrafish gonadal transcriptomes and investigate the effects of 17α-methyltestosterone on gonadal differentiation. RESULTS: At a morphological level, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) masculinised gonads and accelerated spermatogenesis, and these changes were paralleled in masculinisation and de-feminisation of gonadal transcriptomes. MT treatment upregulated expression of genes involved in male sex determination and differentiation (amh, dmrt1, gsdf and wt1a) and those involved in 11-oxygenated androgen production (cyp11c1 and hsd11b2). It also repressed expression of ovarian development and folliculogenesis genes (bmp15, gdf9, figla, zp2.1 and zp3b). Furthermore, MT treatment altered epigenetic modification of histones in zebrafish gonads. Contrary to expectations, higher levels of cyp19a1a or foxl2 expression in control ovaries compared to MT-treated testes and control testes were not statistically significant during early gonad development (40 dpf). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both androgen production and aromatase inhibition are important for androgen-induced gonadal masculinisation and natural testicular differentiation in zebrafish.	2017-07-24	2024-03-06 19:53:38	2024-03-06T19:53:38Z		557		1	18		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28738802 PMCID: PMC5523153					Androgens; Animals; Female; Gonad differentiation; Male; Methyltestosterone; Ovary; Sex Characteristics; Sex Ratio; Sex differentiation; Spermatogenesis; Testis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Pathway analysis of systemic transcriptome responses to injected polystyrene particles in zebrafish larvae	Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)		1879-1514	10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.014		Microplastics are a contaminant of emergent concern in the environment, however, to date there is a limited understanding on their movement within organisms and the response of organisms. In the current study zebrafish embryos at different development stages were exposed to 700nm fluorescent polystyrene (PS) particles and the response pathway after exposure was investigated using imaging and transcriptomics. Our results show limited spreading of particles within the larvae after injection during the blastula stage. This is in contrast to injection of PS particles in the yolk of 2-day old embryos, which resulted in redistribution of the PS particles throughout the bloodstream, and accumulation in the heart region. Although injection was local, the transcriptome profiling showed strong responses of zebrafish embryos exposed to PS particle, indicating a systemic response. We found several biological pathways activated which are related to an immune response in the PS exposed zebrafish larvae. Most notably the complement system was enriched as indicated by upregulation of genes in the alternative complement pathway (e.g. cfhl3, cfhl4, cfb and c9). The fact that complement pathway is activated indicates that plastic microparticles are integrated in immunological recognition processes. This was supported by fluorescence microscopy results, in which we observed co-localisation of neutrophils and macrophages around the PS particles. Identifying these key events can be a first building block to the development of an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). These data subsequently can be used within ecological and human risk assessment.	2017-09	2024-03-06 19:53:37	2024-03-06T19:53:37Z		112-120			190		Aquat Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28704660					Adverse outcome pathway; Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Key event; Larva; Microplastic; Particle Size; Polystyrenes; RNA sequencing; Tissue Distribution; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish embryo

Loss of DNA methylation in zebrafish embryos activates retrotransposons to trigger antiviral signaling	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.147629		Complex cytoplasmic nucleotide-sensing mechanisms can recognize foreign DNA based on a lack of methylation and initiate an immune response to clear the infection. Zebrafish embryos with global DNA hypomethylation caused by mutations in the ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (uhrf1) or DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) genes exhibit a robust interferon induction characteristic of the first line of defense against viral infection. We found that this interferon induction occurred in non-immune cells and examined whether intracellular viral sensing pathways in these cells were the trigger. RNA-seq analysis of uhrf1 and dnmt1 mutants revealed widespread induction of Class I retrotransposons and activation of cytoplasmic DNA viral sensors. Attenuating Sting, phosphorylated Tbk1 and, importantly, blocking reverse transcriptase activity suppressed the expression of interferon genes in uhrf1 mutants. Thus, activation of transposons in cells with global DNA hypomethylation mimics a viral infection by activating cytoplasmic DNA sensors. This suggests that antiviral pathways serve as surveillance of cells that have derepressed intragenomic parasites due to DNA hypomethylation.	2017-08-15	2024-03-06 19:53:37	2024-03-06T19:53:37Z		2925-2939		16	144		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28698226 PMCID: PMC5592811					Animals; Antiviral; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Interferon; Retroelements; Signal Transduction; Trans-Activators; Transposon; Uhrf1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Gage	Genome-wide analysis of facial skeletal regionalization in zebrafish	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.151712		Patterning of the facial skeleton involves the precise deployment of thousands of genes in distinct regions of the pharyngeal arches. Despite the significance for craniofacial development, how genetic programs drive this regionalization remains incompletely understood. Here we use combinatorial labeling of zebrafish cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCCs) to define global gene expression along the dorsoventral axis of the developing arches. Intersection of region-specific transcriptomes with expression changes in response to signaling perturbations demonstrates complex roles for Endothelin 1 (Edn1) signaling in the intermediate joint-forming region, yet a surprisingly minor role in ventralmost regions. Analysis of co-variance across multiple sequencing experiments further reveals clusters of co-regulated genes, with in situ hybridization confirming the domain-specific expression of novel genes. We then created loss-of-function alleles for 12 genes and uncovered antagonistic functions of two new Edn1 targets, follistatin a (fsta) and emx2, in regulating cartilaginous joints in the hyoid arch. Our unbiased discovery and functional analysis of genes with regional expression in zebrafish arch CNCCs reveals complex regulation by Edn1 and points to novel candidates for craniofacial disorders.	2017-08-15	2024-03-06 19:53:37	2024-03-06T19:53:37Z		2994-3005		16	144		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28705894 PMCID: PMC5592815					Animals; Body Patterning; Bone; Branchial Region; Cartilage; Cranial neural crest; Craniofacial; Dlx5a; Dorsoventral patterning; Edn1; Emx2; Endothelin; Endothelin-1; Flow Cytometry; Fsta; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hand2; In Situ Hybridization; Jagged-Notch; Jaw; Mrrf; Skeleton; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Coloboma, a congenital eye malformation, is associated with aberrant forebrain development (holoprosencephaly) and with craniofacial defects (frontonasal dysplasia) in humans, suggesting a critical role for cross-lineage interactions during retinal morphogenesis. ZIC2, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is linked to human holoprosencephaly. We have previously used morpholino assays to show zebrafish zic2 functions in the developing forebrain, retina and craniofacial cartilage. We now report that zebrafish with genetic lesions in zebrafish zic2 orthologs, zic2a and zic2b, develop with retinal coloboma and craniofacial anomalies. We demonstrate a requirement for zic2 in restricting pax2a expression and show evidence that zic2 function limits Hh signaling. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified an early requirement for zic2 in periocular neural crest as an activator of alx1, a transcription factor with essential roles in craniofacial and ocular morphogenesis in human and zebrafish. Collectively, these data establish zic2 mutant zebrafish as a powerful new genetic model for in-depth dissection of cell interactions and genetic controls during craniofacial complex development.	2017-09-01	2024-03-06 19:53:36	2024-03-06T19:53:36Z		92-104		1	429		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28689736 PMCID: PMC5603172					Alx1; Animals; Cartilage; Cell Lineage; Choroid; Coloboma; Face; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hedgehog signaling; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Neural Crest; PAX2 Transcription Factor; Retina; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Skull; Transcription Factors; Veratrum Alkaloids; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zic2

In this study, we aimed to identify evolutionarily conserved critical players in the function of the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) by a comparative transcriptomic approach. We generated a transgenic zebrafish line with expression of the red fluorescent mCherry protein under the control of the zebrafish DCT-specific promoter of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). The mCherry expression was then used to isolate from the zebrafish mesonephric kidneys the distal late (DL) segments, the equivalent of the mammalian DCT, for subsequent RNA-seq analysis. We next compared this zebrafish DL transcriptome to the previously established mouse DCT transcriptome and identified a subset of gene products significantly enriched in both the teleost DL and the mammalian DCT, including SLCs and nuclear transcription factors. Surprisingly, several of the previously described regulators of NCC (e.g., SPAK, KLHL3, ppp1r1a) in the mouse were not found enriched in the zebrafish DL. Nevertheless, the zebrafish DL expressed enriched levels of related homologues. Functional knockdown of one of these genes, ppp1r1b, reduced the phosphorylation of NCC in the zebrafish pronephros, similar to what was seen previously in knockout mice for its homologue, Ppp1r1a. The present work is the first report on global gene expression profiling in a specific nephron portion of the zebrafish kidney, an increasingly used model system for kidney research. Our study suggests that comparative analysis of gene expression between phylogenetically distant species may be an effective approach to identify novel regulators of renal function.	2017-08	2024-03-06 19:53:36	2024-03-06T19:53:36Z		859-867		7-8	469		Pflugers Arch								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28656378					Animals; Comparative transcriptomics; Conserved Sequence; Distal convoluted tubule; Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32; Evolution, Molecular; Kidney; Kidney Tubules, Distal; Mice; NaCl cotransporter; Receptors, Drug; Sodium Chloride Symporters; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Antagonistic regulation of spermatogonial differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by Igf3 and Amh	Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology		1872-8057	10.1016/j.mce.2017.06.017		Fsh-mediated regulation of zebrafish spermatogenesis includes modulating the expression of testicular growth factors. Here, we study if and how two Sertoli cell-derived Fsh-responsive growth factors, anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh; inhibiting steroidogenesis and germ cell differentiation) and insulin-like growth factor 3 (Igf3; stimulating germ cell differentiation), cooperate in regulating spermatogonial development. In dose response and time course experiments with primary testis tissue cultures, Fsh up-regulated igf3 transcript levels and down-regulated amh transcript levels; igf3 transcript levels were more rapidly up-regulated and responded to lower Fsh concentrations than were required to decrease amh mRNA levels. Quantification of immunoreactive Amh and Igf3 on testis sections showed that Fsh increased slightly Igf3 staining but decreased clearly Amh staining. Studying the direct interaction of the two growth factors showed that Amh compromised Igf3-stimulated proliferation of type A (both undifferentiated [Aund] and differentiating [Adiff]) spermatogonia. Also the proliferation of those Sertoli cells associated with Aund spermatogonia was reduced by Amh. To gain more insight into how Amh inhibits germ cell development, we examined Amh-induced changes in testicular gene expression by RNA sequencing. The majority (69%) of the differentially expressed genes was down-regulated by Amh, including several stimulators of spermatogenesis, such as igf3 and steroidogenesis-related genes. At the same time, Amh increased the expression of inhibitory signals, such as inha and id3, or facilitated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. Evaluating one of the potentially inhibitory signals, we indeed found in tissue culture experiments that PGE2 promoted the accumulation of Aund at the expense of Adiff and B spermatogonia. Our data suggest that an important aspect of Fsh bioactivity in stimulating spermatogenesis is implemented by restricting the different inhibitory effects of Amh and by counterbalancing them with stimulatory signals, such as Igf3.	2017-10-15	2024-03-06 19:53:35	2024-03-06T19:53:35Z		112-124			454		Mol Cell Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28645700					Androgens; Animals; Anti-Mullerian Hormone; Anti-müllerian hormone; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Dinoprostone; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Follicle-stimulating hormone; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Insulin-like growth factor; Male; RNA sequencing; Somatomedins; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Testis; Time Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, this ability is not shared by another teleost, the medaka. In order to identify cellular and molecular bases for this difference, we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses following cardiac cryoinjury. This comparison points to major differences in immune cell dynamics between these models. Upon closer examination, we observed delayed and reduced macrophage recruitment in medaka, along with delayed neutrophil clearance. To investigate the role of immune responses in cardiac regeneration, we delayed macrophage recruitment in zebrafish and observed compromised neovascularization, neutrophil clearance, cardiomyocyte proliferation and scar resolution. In contrast, stimulating Toll-like receptor signaling in medaka enhanced immune cell dynamics and promoted neovascularization, neutrophil clearance, cardiomyocyte proliferation and scar resolution. Altogether, these data provide further insight into the complex role of the immune response during regeneration, and serve as a platform to identify and test additional regulators of cardiac repair.	2017-06-20	2024-03-06 19:53:35	2024-03-06T19:53:35Z		e25605			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28632131 PMCID: PMC5498136					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Danio Rerio; Gene Expression Profiling; Heart Injuries; Immunity, Cellular; Macrophages; Myocytes, Cardiac; Neutrophils; Oryzias; Oryzias latipes; Regeneration; Zebrafish; developmental biology; medaka; stem cells; zebrafish

During maternal-to-zygotic transition of animal development, thousands of maternal mRNAs are degraded by multiple mechanisms including microRNAs and codon-mediated decay. Enzymatic requirements for maternal mRNA clearance, however, are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed a contribution of the decapping enzyme Dcp2 to maternal mRNA clearance in zebrafish by over-expressing catalytically inactive Dcp2 and performing RNA-seq analysis. As expected, Dcp2 had a widespread role in maternal mRNA clearance. Interestingly, each mRNA showed differential dependency on Dcp2-mediated decapping and Cnot7-mediated deadenylation for degradation. Correlation analysis identified several mRNA features that were associated with the observed differential dependency. Our results show pervasive yet nonuniform contributions of the decapping enzyme Dcp2 and the deadenylase Cnot7 to maternal mRNA clearance.	2017-07	2024-03-06 19:53:35	2024-03-06T19:53:35Z		670-678		7	22		Genes Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28557307					Animals; Endoribonucleases; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Many of the known mutations that alter the pattern act cell-autonomously in pigment cells, and our knowledge about external regulators is limited. Here, we describe novel zebrafish mau mutants, which encompass several dominant missense mutations in Aquaporin 3a (Aqp3a) that lead to broken stripes and short fins. A loss-of-function aqp3a allele, generated by CRISPR-Cas9, has no phenotypic consequences, demonstrating that Aqp3a is dispensable for normal development. Strikingly, the pigment cells from dominant mau mutants are capable of forming a wild-type pattern when developing in a wild-type environment, but the surrounding tissues in the mutants influence pigment cell behaviour and interfere with the patterning process.

KWVK44C5	journalArticle	2017	Wang, Lei; Ma, Xiao; Xu, Xiaolei; Zhang, Yuji	Systematic identification and characterization of cardiac long intergenic noncoding RNAs in zebrafish	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-017-00823-3		Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are increasingly recognized as potential key regulators of heart development and related diseases, but their identities and functions remain elusive. In this study, we sought to identify and characterize the cardiac lincRNA transcriptome in the experimentally accessible zebrafish model by integrating bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation. By conducting genome-wide RNA sequencing profiling of zebrafish embryonic hearts, adult hearts, and adult muscle, we generated a high-confidence set of 813 cardiac lincRNA transcripts, 423 of which are novel. Among these lincRNAs, 564 are expressed in the embryonic heart, and 730 are expressed in the adult heart, including 2 novel lincRNAs, TCONS_00000891 and TCONS_00028686, which exhibit cardiac-enriched expression patterns in adult heart. Using a method similar to a fetal gene program, we identified 51 lincRNAs with differential expression patterns between embryonic and adult hearts, among which TCONS_00009015 responded to doxorubicin-induced cardiac stress. In summary, our genome-wide systematic identification and characterization of cardiac lincRNAs lays the foundation for future studies in this vertebrate model to elucidate crucial roles for cardiac lincRNAs during heart development and cardiac diseases.	2017-04-28	2024-03-06 19:53:34	2024-03-06T19:53:34Z		1250		1	7		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28455512 PMCID: PMC5430783					Animals; Computational Biology; DNA, Intergenic; Gene Expression Profiling; Heart; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Mural lymphatic endothelial cells regulate meningeal angiogenesis in the zebrafish	Nature Neuroscience		1546-1726	10.1038/nn.4558		Mural cells of the vertebrate brain maintain vascular integrity and function, play roles in stroke and are involved in maintenance of neural stem cells. However, the origins, diversity and roles of mural cells remain to be fully understood. Using transgenic zebrafish, we identified a population of isolated mural lymphatic endothelial cells surrounding meningeal blood vessels. These meningeal mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs) express lymphatic endothelial cell markers and form by sprouting from blood vessels. In larvae, muLECs develop from a lymphatic endothelial loop in the midbrain into a dispersed, nonlumenized mural lineage. muLEC development requires normal signaling through the Vegfc-Vegfd-Ccbe1-Vegfr3 pathway. Mature muLECs produce vascular growth factors and accumulate low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. We find that muLECs are essential for normal meningeal vascularization. Together, these data identify an unexpected lymphatic lineage and developmental mechanism necessary for establishing normal meningeal blood vasculature.	2017-06	2024-03-06 19:53:34	2024-03-06T19:53:34Z		774-783		6	20		Nat Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28459441					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Endothelial Cells; Female; Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Meninges; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Distinct Roles for Matrix Metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in Embryonic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Emergence, Migration, and Niche Colonization	Stem Cell Reports		2213-6711	10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.03.016		Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are formed during ontogeny from hemogenic endothelium in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VDA). Critically, the cellular mechanism(s) allowing HSPC egress and migration to secondary niches are incompletely understood. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are inflammation-responsive proteins that regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cellular interactions, and signaling. Here, inhibition of vascular-associated Mmp2 function caused accumulation of fibronectin-rich ECM, retention of runx1/cmyb+ HSPCs in the VDA, and delayed caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) colonization; these defects were absent in fibronectin mutants, indicating that Mmp2 facilitates endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition via ECM remodeling. In contrast, Mmp9 was dispensable for HSPC budding, being instead required for proper colonization of secondary niches. Significantly, these migration defects were mimicked by overexpression and blocked by knockdown of C-X-C motif chemokine-12 (cxcl12), suggesting that Mmp9 controls CHT homeostasis through chemokine regulation. Our findings indicate Mmp2 and Mmp9 play distinct but complementary roles in developmental HSPC production and migration.	2017-05-09	2024-03-06 19:53:33	2024-03-06T19:53:33Z		1226-1241		5	8		Stem Cell Reports								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28416284 PMCID: PMC5425629					Animals; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Chemokine CXCL12; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Cxcl12; Embryonic Stem Cells; Extracellular Matrix; Fibronectins; HSC/HSPC; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mmp2; Mmp9; PGE(2); Stem Cell Niche; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; extracellular matrix; fibronectin; inflammation; zebrafish

EpCAM controls morphogenetic programs during zebrafish pronephros development	Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications		1090-2104	10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.035		Epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is dynamically expressed in human and murine renal epithelia during development. The levels of EpCAM in the renal epithelium are upregulated both during regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion injury and in renal-derived carcinomas. The role of EpCAM in early kidney development, however, has remained unclear. The zebrafish pronephros shows a similar segmentation pattern to the mammalian metanephric nephron, and has recently emerged as a tractable model to study the regulatory programs governing early nephrogenesis. Since EpCAM shows persistent expression in the pronephros throughout early development, we developed a method to study the global changes in gene expression in specific pronephric segments of wild type and EpCAM-deficient zebrafish embryos. In epcam mutants, we found 379 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that EpCAM controls various developmental programs, including uretric bud development, morphogenesis of branching epithelium, regulation of cell differentiation and cilium morphogenesis.	2017-05-27	2024-03-06 19:53:33	2024-03-06T19:53:33Z		209-215		2	487		Biochem Biophys Res Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28411024					Animals; Distal tubule; Epcam; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Laser-capture microdissection; Membrane Glycoproteins; Morphogenesis; Pronephros; Pronephros development; RNA-seq; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Defining the transcriptomic landscape of the developing enteric nervous system and its cellular environment	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-017-3653-2		BACKGROUND: Motility and the coordination of moving food through the gastrointestinal tract rely on a complex network of neurons known as the enteric nervous system (ENS). Despite its critical function, many of the molecular mechanisms that direct the development of the ENS and the elaboration of neural network connections remain unknown. The goal of this study was to transcriptionally identify molecular pathways and candidate genes that drive specification, differentiation and the neural circuitry of specific neural progenitors, the phox2b expressing ENS cell lineage, during normal enteric nervous system development. Because ENS development is tightly linked to its environment, the transcriptional landscape of the cellular environment of the intestine was also analyzed. RESULTS: Thousands of zebrafish intestines were manually dissected from a transgenic line expressing green fluorescent protein under the phox2b regulatory elements [Tg(phox2b:EGFP) w37 ]. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to separate GFP-positive phox2b expressing ENS progenitor and derivatives from GFP-negative intestinal cells. RNA-seq was performed to obtain accurate, reproducible transcriptional profiles and the unbiased detection of low level transcripts. Analysis revealed genes and pathways that may function in ENS cell determination, genes that may be identifiers of different ENS subtypes, and genes that define the non-neural cellular microenvironment of the ENS. Differential expression analysis between the two cell populations revealed the expected neuronal nature of the phox2b expressing lineage including the enrichment for genes required for neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and identified many novel genes not previously associated with ENS development. Pathway analysis pointed to a high level of G-protein coupled pathway activation, and identified novel roles for candidate pathways such as the Nogo/Reticulon axon guidance pathway in ENS development. CONCLUSION: We report the comprehensive gene expression profiles of a lineage-specific population of enteric progenitors, their derivatives, and their microenvironment during normal enteric nervous system development. Our results confirm previously implicated genes and pathways required for ENS development, and also identify scores of novel candidate genes and pathways. Thus, our dataset suggests various potential mechanisms that drive ENS development facilitating characterization and discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to improve gastrointestinal disorders.	2017-04-12	2024-03-06 19:53:33	2024-03-06T19:53:33Z		290		1	18		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28403821 PMCID: PMC5389105					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Movement; Cellular Microenvironment; Enteric Nervous System; Enteric nervous system; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hirschsprungs; Homeodomain Proteins; Neural crest; Neurogenesis; RNA-sequencing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; phox2b

We have developed a versatile, tissue-specific binary in vivo biotinylation system in zebrafish termed biotagging that uses genetically encoded components to biotinylate target proteins, enabling in-depth genome-wide analyses of their molecular interactions. Using tissue-specific drivers and cell-compartment-specific effector lines, we demonstrate the specificity of the biotagging toolkit at the biochemical, cellular, and transcriptional levels. We use biotagging to characterize the in vivo transcriptional landscape of migratory neural crest and myocardial cells in different cellular compartments (ribosomes and nucleus). These analyses reveal a comprehensive network of coding and non-coding RNAs and cis-regulatory modules, demonstrating that tissue-specific identity is embedded in the nuclear transcriptomes. By eliminating background inherent to complex embryonic environments, biotagging allows analyses of molecular interactions at high resolution.	2017-04-11	2024-03-06 19:53:32	2024-03-06T19:53:32Z		425-440		2	19		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28402863 PMCID: PMC5400779					Animals; Cell Compartmentation; Cell Lineage; Conserved Sequence; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Neural Crest; Organ Specificity; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; bi-directional transcription; cis-regulation; enhancers; in vivo biotinylation; myocardium; neural crest; nuclear transcriptome

A novel perivascular cell population in the zebrafish brain	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.24369		The blood-brain barrier is essential for the proper homeostasis and function of the CNS, but its mechanism of function is poorly understood. Perivascular cells surrounding brain blood vessels are thought to be important for blood-brain barrier establishment, but their roles are not well defined. Here, we describe a novel perivascular cell population closely associated with blood vessels on the zebrafish brain. Based on similarities in their morphology, location, and scavenger behavior, these cells appear to be the zebrafish equivalent of cells variably characterized as Fluorescent Granular Perithelial cells (FGPs), perivascular macrophages, or 'Mato Cells' in mammals. Despite their macrophage-like morphology and perivascular location, zebrafish FGPs appear molecularly most similar to lymphatic endothelium, and our imaging studies suggest that these cells emerge by differentiation from endothelium of the optic choroidal vascular plexus. Our findings provide the first report of a perivascular cell population in the brain derived from vascular endothelium.	2017-04-11	2024-03-06 19:53:32	2024-03-06T19:53:32Z		e24369			6		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28395729 PMCID: PMC5423774					Animals; Blood Vessels; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Cell Differentiation; Endothelial Cells; Fluorescent Granular Periendothelial cells; Mato Cells; Perivascular macrophages; Zebrafish; developmental biology; lymphatics; mouse; neuroscience; stem cells; vessels; zebrafish; zebrafish brain																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

Infection and RNA-seq analysis of a zebrafish tlr2 mutant shows a broad function of this toll-like receptor in transcriptional and metabolic control and defense to Mycobacterium marinum infection	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-019-6265-1		BACKGROUND: The function of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in host defense against pathogens, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is poorly understood. To investigate the role of TLR2 during mycobacterial infection, we analyzed the response of tlr2 zebrafish mutant larvae to infection with Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a close relative to Mtb, as a model for tuberculosis. We measured infection phenotypes and transcriptome responses using RNA deep sequencing in mutant and control larvae. RESULTS: tlr2 mutant embryos at 2 dpf do not show differences in numbers of macrophages and neutrophils compared to control embryos. However, we found substantial changes in gene expression in these mutants, particularly in metabolic pathways, when compared with the heterozygote tlr2+/- control. At 4 days after Mm infection, the total bacterial burden and the presence of extracellular bacteria were higher in tlr2-/- larvae than in tlr2+/-, or tlr2+/+ larvae, whereas granuloma numbers were reduced, showing a function of Tlr2 in zebrafish host defense. RNAseq analysis of infected tlr2-/- versus tlr2+/- shows that the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in response to infection was greatly diminished in tlr2 mutants by at least 2 fold and 10 fold, respectively. Analysis of the transcriptome data and qPCR validation shows that Mm infection of tlr2 mutants leads to decreased mRNA levels of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses, including il1b, tnfb, cxcl11aa/ac, fosl1a, and cebpb. Furthermore, RNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of genes for Maf family transcription factors, vitamin D receptors, and Dicps proteins is altered in tlr2 mutants with or without infection. In addition, the data indicate a function of Tlr2 in the control of induction of cytokines and chemokines, such as the CXCR3-CXCL11 signaling axis. CONCLUSION: The transcriptome and infection burden analyses show a function of Tlr2 as a protective factor against mycobacteria. Transcriptome analysis revealed tlr2-specific pathways involved in Mm infection, which are related to responses to Mtb infection in human macrophages. Considering its dominant function in control of transcriptional processes that govern defense responses and metabolism, the TLR2 protein can be expected to be also of importance for other infectious diseases and interactions with the microbiome.	2019-11-20	2024-03-06 20:00:19	2024-03-06T20:00:19Z		878		1	20		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31747871 PMCID: PMC6869251					Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta; Chemokine CXCL11; Disease Resistance; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fish Diseases; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Interleukin-1beta; Larva; Lymphotoxin-alpha; Macrophages; Maf Transcription Factors; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Neutrophils; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; RNA deep sequencing; RNAseq; Receptors, CXCR3; Receptors, Immunologic; TLR2; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Ewa	A NF-ĸB-Activin A signaling axis enhances prostate cancer metastasis	Oncogene		1476-5594	10.1038/s41388-019-1103-0		Metastasis is a main cause of death in prostate cancer (PCa). To dissect the molecular cues from cancer cell-microenvironment interaction that drive metastatic cascade, bone metastatic PCa cells were intravenously implanted into zebrafish embryos and mice tibia forming metastatic lesions. Transcriptomic analysis showed an elevated expression of stemness genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β family member Activin A in the cancer cells at metastatic onset in both animal models. Consistently, analysis of clinical datasets revealed that the expression of Activin A is specifically elevated in metastases and correlates with poor prognosis in stratified high-risk PCa patients. It is further unveiled that the microenvironment induced Activin A expression by NF-κB activation. The elevated level of Activin A enhanced the invasive ALDHhi CSC-like phenotypes and PCa proliferation by activation of Smad and ERK1/2 signaling driving metastasis. Suppression of Activin A or Activin receptor significantly reduced the CSC-like subpopulation, invasion, metastatic growth, and bone lesion formation in zebrafish and mice xenografts, suggesting a functional role of NF-κB-dependent Activin A in PCa metastasis. Overall, our study demonstrates that human PCa cells can display a comparable response with the microenvironment in zebrafish and mice xenografts. Combining both animal models, we uncovered the microenvironment-dependent activin signaling as an essential driver in PCa metastasis with therapeutic potential.	2020-02	2024-03-06 20:00:18	2024-03-06T20:00:18Z		1634-1651		8	39		Oncogene								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31740783					Activins; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Male; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; NF-kappa B; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplastic Stem Cells; PC-3 Cells; Prostatic Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Smad Proteins; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish

Therefore, transgenic etv2 reporter lines provide a valuable tool to study vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis. However, previously generated zebrafish reporter lines do not fully recapitulate the endogenous pattern of etv2 expression. RESULTS: Here we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-independent DNA repair approach to knock-in a Gal4 transcriptional activator into the zebrafish etv2 genomic locus, thus generating etv2 ci32Gt gene trap line. etv2 ci32Gt ; UAS:GFP embryos show GFP expression in vascular endothelial, myeloid and red blood cells. Because gal4 insertion interrupts the etv2 locus, homozygous etv2 ci32Gt embryos display defects in vasculogenesis and myelopoiesis, and enable visualizing etv2-deficient hematovascular progenitors in live embryos. Furthermore, we performed differential transcriptome analysis of sorted GFP-positive cells from heterozygous and homozygous etv2 ci32Gt embryos. Approximately 500 downregulated genes were identified in etv2 ci32Gt homozygous embryos, which include multiple genes expressed in vascular endothelial and myeloid cells. CONCLUSIONS: The etv2 ci32Gt gene trap line and the data sets of misregulated genes will be valuable resources to study hematopoietic and vascular development.	2020-02	2024-03-06 20:00:18	2024-03-06T20:00:18Z		245-261		2	249		Dev Dyn								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31705559 PMCID: PMC7181369					Animals; CRISPR; CRISPR-Associated Protein 9; Cas9; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; RNA-seq; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; myeloid; red blood cell; transcriptome; vascular endothelial; zebrafish

Early sarcomere and metabolic defects in a zebrafish pitx2c cardiac arrhythmia model	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1913905116		Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. The major AF susceptibility locus 4q25 establishes long-range interactions with the promoter of PITX2, a transcription factor gene with critical functions during cardiac development. While many AF-linked loci have been identified in genome-wide association studies, mechanistic understanding into how genetic variants, including those at the 4q25 locus, increase vulnerability to AF is mostly lacking. Here, we show that loss of pitx2c in zebrafish leads to adult cardiac phenotypes with substantial similarities to pathologies observed in AF patients, including arrhythmia, atrial conduction defects, sarcomere disassembly, and altered cardiac metabolism. These phenotypes are also observed in a subset of pitx2c+/- fish, mimicking the situation in humans. Most notably, the onset of these phenotypes occurs at an early developmental stage. Detailed analyses of pitx2c loss- and gain-of-function embryonic hearts reveal changes in sarcomeric and metabolic gene expression and function that precede the onset of cardiac arrhythmia first observed at larval stages. We further find that antioxidant treatment of pitx2c-/- larvae significantly reduces the incidence and severity of cardiac arrhythmia, suggesting that metabolic dysfunction is an important driver of conduction defects. We propose that these early sarcomere and metabolic defects alter cardiac function and contribute to the electrical instability and structural remodeling observed in adult fish. Overall, these data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the development and pathophysiology of some cardiac arrhythmias and importantly, increase our understanding of how developmental perturbations can predispose to functional defects in the adult heart.	2019-11-26	2024-03-06 20:00:18	2024-03-06T20:00:18Z		24115-24121		48	116		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31704768 PMCID: PMC6883774					Acetylcysteine; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antioxidants; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiac Conduction System Disease; Cardiomyopathies; Disease Models, Animal; Electrocardiography; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeodomain Proteins; Larva; Mitochondria, Heart; Sarcomeres; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiac development; cardiac metabolism; cardiomyopathy; transcriptional profiling

It is unclear whether the heart is composed of several cardiomyocyte populations bearing different capacity to replace lost myocardium. Here, using sox10 genetic fate mapping, we identify a subset of preexistent cardiomyocytes in the adult zebrafish heart with a distinct gene expression profile that expanded after cryoinjury. Genetic ablation of sox10+ cardiomyocytes impairs cardiac regeneration, revealing that these cells play a role in heart regeneration.	2019-10-22	2024-03-06 20:00:17	2024-03-06T20:00:17Z		1041-1054.e5		4	29		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31644901 PMCID: PMC6856760					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Heart; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; SOXE Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiomyocyte proliferation; heart regeneration; sox10; zebrafish

To gain information about genes important for defense against tuberculosis, we used a well-established tuberculosis model; Mycobacterium marinum infection in adult zebrafish. To characterize the immunological response to mycobacterial infection at 14 days post infection, we performed a whole-genome level transcriptome analysis using cells from kidney, the main hematopoietic organ of adult zebrafish. Among the upregulated genes, those associated with immune signaling and regulation formed the largest category, whereas the largest group of downregulated genes had a metabolic role. We also performed a forward genetic screen in adult zebrafish and identified a fish line with severely impaired survival during chronic mycobacterial infection.

However, developing tissues also undergo dynamic morphogenesis, which may produce cells with unfit morphogen signalling and consequent noisy morphogen gradients. Here we show that a cell competition-related system corrects such noisy morphogen gradients. Zebrafish imaging analyses of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling gradient, which acts as a morphogen to establish embryonic anterior-posterior patterning, identify that unfit cells with abnormal Wnt/β-catenin activity spontaneously appear and produce noise in the gradient. Communication between unfit and neighbouring fit cells via cadherin proteins stimulates apoptosis of the unfit cells by activating Smad signalling and reactive oxygen species production. This unfit cell elimination is required for proper Wnt/β-catenin gradient formation and consequent anterior-posterior patterning. Because this gradient controls patterning not only in the embryo but also in adult tissues, this system may support tissue robustness and disease prevention.	2019-10-17	2024-03-06 20:00:16	2024-03-06T20:00:16Z		4710		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31624259 PMCID: PMC6797755					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Body Patterning; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Morphogenesis; Time-Lapse Imaging; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; beta Catenin

Epilepsy has been found to have numerous etiologies and, although about two-thirds of epilepsies were classically considered idiopathic, the majority of those are now believed to be of genetic origin. Mutations in genes involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission have been associated with a broad range of epilepsy syndromes. Mutations in the GABA-A receptor gamma 2 subunit gene (GABRG2), for example, have been associated with absence epilepsy and febrile seizures in humans. Several rodent models of GABRG2 loss of function depict clinical features of the disease; however, alternative genetic models more amenable for the study of ictogenesis and for high-throughput screening purposes are still needed. In this context, we generated a gabrg2 knockout (KO) zebrafish model (which we called R23X) that displayed light/dark-induced reflex seizures. Through high-resolution in vivo calcium imaging of the brain, we showed that this phenotype is associated with widespread increases in neuronal activity that can be effectively alleviated by the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Moreover, these seizures only occur at the larval stages but disappear after 1 week of age. Interestingly, our whole-transcriptome analysis showed that gabrg2 KO does not alter the expression of genes in the larval brain. As a result, the gabrg2-/- zebrafish is a novel in vivo genetic model of early epilepsies that opens new doors to investigate ictogenesis and for further drug-screening assays.	2019-11-11	2024-03-06 20:00:16	2024-03-06T20:00:16Z		dmm040782		11	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31582559 PMCID: PMC6899022					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Epilepsy; GABA; GABA receptor; Gene Knockout Techniques; Larva; Light; Neurological; Protein Subunits; Receptors, GABA-A; Reflex; Seizures; Transcriptome; Valproic Acid; Zebrafish

FACS typically relies on the ability to label cell types of interest with antibodies or fluorescent transgenic constructs. However, antibody availability is often limited, and genetic manipulation is labor intensive or impossible in the case of primary human tissue. To date, no systematic method exists to enrich for cell types without a priori knowledge of cell-type markers. Here, we propose GateID, a computational method that combines single-cell transcriptomics with FACS index sorting to purify cell types of choice using only native cellular properties such as cell size, granularity, and mitochondrial content. We validate GateID by purifying various cell types from zebrafish kidney marrow and the human pancreas to high purity without resorting to specific antibodies or transgenes.	2019-10-03	2024-03-06 20:00:16	2024-03-06T20:00:16Z		527-542.e19		2	179		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31585086 PMCID: PMC6863042					Animals; Cell Separation; FACS gate prediction and normalization; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Kidney; Pancreas; Single-Cell Analysis; Software; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; bisulphite sequencing; cell type purification; flow cytometry; human pancreas; machine learning; optimization algorithm; single-cell transcriptomics; zebrafish hematopoiesis

Elizabeth	Zebrafish MITF-Low Melanoma Subtype Models Reveal Transcriptional Subclusters and MITF-Independent Residual Disease	Cancer Research		1538-7445	10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0037		The melanocyte-inducing transcription factor (MITF)-low melanoma transcriptional signature is predictive of poor outcomes for patients, but little is known about its biological significance, and animal models are lacking. Here, we used zebrafish genetic models with low activity of Mitfa (MITF-low) and established that the MITF-low state is causal of melanoma progression and a predictor of melanoma biological subtype. MITF-low zebrafish melanomas resembled human MITF-low melanomas and were enriched for stem and invasive (mesenchymal) gene signatures. MITF-low activity coupled with a p53 mutation was sufficient to promote superficial growth melanomas, whereas BRAFV600E accelerated MITF-low melanoma onset and further promoted the development of MITF-high nodular growth melanomas. Genetic inhibition of MITF activity led to rapid regression; recurrence occurred following reactivation of MITF. At the regression site, there was minimal residual disease that was resistant to loss of MITF activity (termed MITF-independent cells) with very low-to-no MITF activity or protein. Transcriptomic analysis of MITF-independent residual disease showed enrichment of mesenchymal and neural crest stem cell signatures similar to human therapy-resistant melanomas. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MITF-independent residual disease was heterogeneous depending on melanoma subtype. Further, there was a shared subpopulation of residual disease cells that was enriched for a neural crest G0-like state that preexisted in the primary tumor and remained present in recurring melanomas. These findings suggest that invasive and stem-like programs coupled with cellular heterogeneity contribute to poor outcomes for MITF-low melanoma patients and that MITF-independent subpopulations are an important therapeutic target to achieve long-term survival outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a useful model for MITF-low melanomas and MITF-independent cell populations that can be used to study the mechanisms that drive these tumors as well as identify potential therapeutic options.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/22/5769/F1.large.jpg.	2019-11-15	2024-03-06 20:00:15	2024-03-06T20:00:15Z		5769-5784		22	79		Cancer Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31582381 PMCID: PMC7116150					Animals; Drug Resistance; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm, Residual; Neural Crest; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Stem Cells; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Prospective isolation of highly purified HSCs is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of HSCs. The zebrafish is an elegant genetic model for the study of hematopoiesis due to its many unique advantages. It has not yet been possible, however, to purify HSCs in adult zebrafish due to a lack of specific HSC markers. Here we show the enrichment of zebrafish HSCs by a combination of two HSC-related transgenes, gata2a:GFP and runx1:mCherry. The double-positive fraction of gata2a:GFP and runx1:mCherry (gata2a+ runx1+) was detected at approximately 0.16% in the kidney, the main hematopoietic organ in teleosts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that gata2a+ runx1+ cells showed typical molecular signatures of HSCs, including upregulation of gata2b, gfi1aa, runx1t1, pbx1b, and meis1b. Transplantation assays demonstrated that long-term repopulating HSCs were highly enriched within the gata2a+ runx1+ fraction. In contrast, colony-forming assays showed that gata2a- runx1+ cells abundantly contain erythroid- and/or myeloid-primed progenitors. Thus, our purification method of HSCs in the zebrafish kidney is useful to identify molecular cues needed to regulate self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs.	2019-10-02	2024-03-06 20:00:15	2024-03-06T20:00:15Z		14205		1	9		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31578390 PMCID: PMC6775131					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; DNA-Binding Proteins; Flow Cytometry; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Kidney; Stem Cells; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Heterogeneous beta-catenin activation is sufficient to cause hepatocellular carcinoma in zebrafish	Biology Open		2046-6390	10.1242/bio.047829		Up to 41% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) result from activating mutations in the CTNNB1 gene encoding β-catenin. HCC-associated CTNNB1 mutations stabilize the β-catenin protein, leading to nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization of β-catenin and downstream activation of Wnt target genes. In patient HCC samples, β-catenin nuclear and cytoplasmic localization are typically patchy, even among HCC with highly active CTNNB1 mutations. The functional and clinical relevance of this heterogeneity in β-catenin activation are not well understood. To define mechanisms of β-catenin-driven HCC initiation, we generated a Cre-lox system that enabled switching on activated β-catenin in (1) a small number of hepatocytes in early development; or (2) the majority of hepatocytes in later development or adulthood. We discovered that switching on activated β-catenin in a subset of larval hepatocytes was sufficient to drive HCC initiation. To determine the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling heterogeneity later in hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed RNA-seq analysis of zebrafish β-catenin-driven HCC. At the single-cell level, 2.9% to 15.2% of hepatocytes from zebrafish β-catenin-driven HCC expressed two or more of the Wnt target genes axin2, mtor, glula, myca and wif1, indicating focal activation of Wnt signaling in established tumors. Thus, heterogeneous β-catenin activation drives HCC initiation and persists throughout hepatocarcinogenesis.	2019-10-17	2024-03-06 20:00:14	2024-03-06T20:00:14Z		bio047829		10	8		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31575545 PMCID: PMC6826293					Beta-catenin; CreLox; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Single-cell RNAseq; Zebrafish

However, the studies concerning their toxicity towards aquatic species are based on individual chemicals, and the combined toxicity of PAEs to aquatic organisms remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the potential toxicity mechanisms associated with combined exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) in adult female zebrafish ovaries. Zebrafish were exposed to DBP, DiBP and their mixtures for 30 days, and their effects on ovarian histology, plasma sex hormones and ovarian transcriptomics were investigated. Plasma estradiol (E2) levels were significantly decreased by 38.9% in the DBP-1133 exposure group and 41.0% in the DiBP-1038 exposure group. The percentage of late/mature oocytes was also significantly decreased by 17.3% under DBP-1133 exposure and 16.2% under DiBP-1038 exposure, while that under combined exposure was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, transcriptome sequencing revealed 2564 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in zebrafish ovaries after exposure to the mixtures. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, GnRH, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis and steroid hormone biosynthesis signaling pathways. These results revealed that combined exposure exerts potential reproductive toxicity at the molecular level.	2019-11	2024-03-06 20:00:14	2024-03-06T20:00:14Z		105290			216		Aquat Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31518775					Animals; Combined toxicity; Dibutyl Phthalate; Environmental Exposure; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Ovary; Phthalate esters; Reproducibility of Results; Reproduction; Toxicity mechanism; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish ovarian

However, myeloid-derived professional phagocytes have not yet colonized the trunk region during early neurogenesis. How apoptotic cells are removed from this region during these stages remains largely unknown. Using live imaging in zebrafish, we demonstrate that neural crest cells (NCCs) respond rapidly to dying cells and phagocytose cellular debris around the neural tube. Additionally, NCCs have the ability to enter the CNS through motor exit point transition zones and clear debris in the spinal cord. Surprisingly, NCCs phagocytosis mechanistically resembles macrophage phagocytosis and their recruitment toward cellular debris is mediated by interleukin-1β. Taken together, our results reveal a role for NCCs in phagocytosis of debris in the developing nervous system before the presence of professional phagocytes.	2019-09-19	2024-03-06 20:00:13	2024-03-06T20:00:13Z		74-89.e10		1	179		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31495570 PMCID: PMC6754278					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Interleukin-1beta; Neural Crest; Neurogenesis; Peripheral Nervous System; Phagocytes; Phagocytosis; Phagosomes; Spinal Cord; Zebrafish; interleukin-1β; macrophages; neural crest cells; neural development; neurogenesis; phagocytosis; zebrafish

While regulation of the formation of this structure by major signaling pathways has been described, the transcriptional control of LRO formation is poorly understood. Using the zebrafish model, we show that the transcription factors and cofactors mediating or regulating the transcriptional outcome of the Hippo signaling pathway play a pivotal role in controlling the expression of genes essential to the formation of the LRO including ligands and receptors of signaling pathways involved in this process and most genes required for motile ciliogenesis. Moreover, the transcription cofactor, Vgll4l regulates epigenetic programming in LRO progenitors by controlling the expression of writers and readers of DNA methylation marks. Altogether, our study uncovers a novel and essential role for the transcriptional effectors and regulators of the Hippo pathway in establishing LR asymmetry.	2019-09-12	2024-03-06 20:00:13	2024-03-06T20:00:13Z		e45241			8		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31513014 PMCID: PMC6759317					Animals; Body Patterning; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hippo pathway; Left-Right Organizer; Left-Right asymmetry; Signal Transduction; Taz; Transcription Factors; Vgll4; Yap; Zebrafish; developmental biology; zebrafish

Here, we generated and characterized an inherited DCM model in adult zebrafish and used this model to search for therapeutic strategies. We employed transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) genome editing technology to generate frame-shift mutants for the zebrafish ortholog of human BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), an established DCM-causative gene. As in mammals, the zebrafish bag3 homozygous mutant (bag3e2/e2 ) exhibited aberrant proteostasis, as indicated by impaired autophagy flux and elevated ubiquitinated protein aggregation. Through comprehensive phenotyping analysis of the mutant, we identified phenotypic traits that resembled DCM phenotypes in mammals, including cardiac chamber enlargement, reduced ejection fraction characterized by increased end-systolic volume/body weight (ESV/BW), and reduced contractile myofibril activation kinetics. Nonbiased transcriptome analysis identified the hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in bag3e2/e2 mutant hearts. Further genetic studies showed that mtorxu015/+ , an mTOR haploinsufficiency mutant, repaired abnormal proteostasis, improved cardiac function and rescued the survival of the bag3e2/e2 mutant. This study established the bag3e2/e2 mutant as a DCM model in adult zebrafish and suggested mtor as a candidate therapeutic target gene for BAG3 cardiomyopathy.	2019-10-01	2024-03-06 20:00:12	2024-03-06T20:00:12Z		dmm040154		10	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31492659 PMCID: PMC6826022					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; BCL2-associated athanogene 3; Base Sequence; Cardiomyopathies; Danio rerio; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Gene Expression Profiling; Haploinsufficiency; Mutation; Myocardium; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; mTOR

Maintenance of spatial gene expression by Polycomb-mediated repression after formation of a vertebrate body plan	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.178590		Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that are important regulators of cell fate during embryonic development. Among them, Ezh2 is responsible for catalyzing the epigenetic repressive mark H3K27me3 and is essential for animal development. The ability of zebrafish embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic ezh2 to form a normal body plan provides a unique model for comprehensively studying Ezh2 function during early development in vertebrates. By using a multi-omics approach, we found that Ezh2 is required for the deposition of H3K27me3 and is essential for proper recruitment of Polycomb group protein Rnf2. However, despite the complete absence of PcG-associated epigenetic mark and proteins, only minor changes in H3K4me3 deposition and gene and protein expression occur. These changes were mainly due to local dysregulation of transcription factors outside their normal expression boundaries. Altogether, our results in zebrafish show that Polycomb-mediated gene repression is important immediately after the body plan is formed to maintain spatially restricted expression profiles of transcription factors, and we highlight the differences that exist in the timing of PcG protein action between vertebrate species.	2019-09-30	2024-03-06 20:00:12	2024-03-06T20:00:12Z		dev178590		19	146		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31488564 PMCID: PMC6803366					Animals; Body Patterning; ChIP-seq; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Epigenesis, Genetic; Ezh2; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Histones; Lysine; Methylation; Mutation; Polycomb; Polycomb-Group Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; RNA, Messenger; Repressor Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; Vertebrates; Zebrafish; Zygote

Vegfc/d-dependent regulation of the lymphatic vasculature during cardiac regeneration is influenced by injury context	NPJ Regenerative medicine		2057-3995	10.1038/s41536-019-0079-2		The lymphatic vasculature mediates essential physiological functions including fluid homeostasis, lipid and hormone transport, and immune cell trafficking. Recent studies have suggested that promoting lymphangiogenesis enhances cardiac repair following injury, but it is unknown whether lymphangiogenesis is required for cardiac regeneration. Here, we describe the anatomical distribution, regulation, and function of the cardiac lymphatic network in a highly regenerative zebrafish model system using transgenic reporter lines and loss-of-function approaches. We show that zebrafish lacking functional vegfc and vegfd signaling are devoid of a cardiac lymphatic network and display cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of injury, suggesting a role for these vessels in cardiac tissue homeostasis. Using two different cardiac injury models, we report a robust lymphangiogenic response following cryoinjury, but not following apical resection injury. Although the majority of mutants lacking functional vegfc and vegfd signaling were able to mount a full regenerative response even in the complete absence of a cardiac lymphatic vasculature, cardiac regeneration was severely impaired in a subset of mutants, which was associated with heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. These findings reveal a context-dependent requirement for the lymphatic vasculature during cardiac growth and regeneration.	2019	2024-03-06 20:00:11	2024-03-06T20:00:11Z		18			4		NPJ Regen Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31452940 PMCID: PMC6706389					Angiogenesis; Cardiac regeneration

However, how dietary protein is absorbed during critical developmental stages when the gut is still immature is unknown. Here, we show that specialized intestinal cells, which we call lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs), internalize dietary protein via receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis for intracellular digestion and trans-cellular transport. In LREs, we identify a conserved endocytic machinery, composed of the scavenger receptor complex Cubilin/Amnionless and Dab2, that is required for protein uptake by LREs and for growth and survival of larval zebrafish. Moreover, impairing LRE function in suckling mice, via conditional deletion of Dab2, leads to stunted growth and severe protein malnutrition reminiscent of kwashiorkor, a devastating human malnutrition syndrome. These findings identify digestive functions and conserved molecular mechanisms in LREs that are crucial for vertebrate growth and survival.	2019-10-07	2024-03-06 20:00:11	2024-03-06T20:00:11Z		7-20.e6		1	51		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31474562 PMCID: PMC6783362					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; Animals; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Cubilin; Dab2; Dietary Proteins; Disease Models, Animal; Enterocytes; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Ileum; Intestinal Absorption; Intestines; Kwashiorkor; Ligands; Lysosomes; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Receptors, Cell Surface; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; inter-organ transport; intestine; kwashiorkor; lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs); malnutrition; mouse; protein absorption; zebrafish

The vertebrate skin initially consists of two epithelial layers, the outer periderm and inner basal cell layers, which have distinct properties, functions, and fates. The embryonic periderm ultimately disappears during development, whereas basal cells proliferate to form the mature, stratified epidermis. Although much is known about mechanisms of homeostasis in mature skin, relatively little is known about the two cell types in pre-stratification skin. To define the similarities and distinctions between periderm and basal skin epithelial cells, we purified them from zebrafish at early development stages and deeply profiled their gene expression. These analyses identified groups of genes whose tissue enrichment changed at each stage, defining gene flow dynamics of maturing vertebrate epithelia. At each of 52 and 72 hr post-fertilization (hpf), more than 60% of genes enriched in skin cells were similarly expressed in both layers, indicating that they were common epithelial genes, but many others were enriched in one layer or the other. Both expected and novel genes were enriched in periderm and basal cell layers. Genes encoding extracellular matrix, junctional, cytoskeletal, and signaling proteins were prominent among those distinguishing the two epithelial cell types. In situ hybridization and BAC transgenes confirmed our expression data and provided new tools to study zebrafish skin. Collectively, these data provide a resource for studying common and distinguishing features of maturing epithelia.	2019-10-07	2024-03-06 20:00:10	2024-03-06T20:00:10Z		3439-3452		10	9		G3 (Bethesda)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31431477 PMCID: PMC6778804					Animals; Embryonic Development; Epithelium; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Organogenesis; Phenotype; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; epithelia; keratin; skin development; transcriptome; zebrafish

To discover novel therapeutic targets that modulate neutrophil migration, we performed a neutrophil-specific microRNA (miRNA) overexpression screen in zebrafish and identified 8 miRNAs as potent suppressors of neutrophil migration. Among those, miR-199 decreases neutrophil chemotaxis in zebrafish and human neutrophil-like cells. Intriguingly, in terminally differentiated neutrophils, miR-199 alters the cell cycle-related pathways and directly suppresses cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), whose known activity is restricted to cell cycle progression and cell differentiation. Inhibiting Cdk2, but not DNA replication, disrupts cell polarity and chemotaxis of zebrafish neutrophils without inducing cell death. Human neutrophil-like cells deficient in CDK2 fail to polarize and display altered signaling downstream of the formyl peptide receptor. Chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils is also reduced upon CDK2 inhibition. Furthermore, miR-199 overexpression or CDK2 inhibition significantly improves the outcome of lethal systemic inflammation challenges in zebrafish. Our results therefore reveal previously unknown functions of miR-199 and CDK2 in regulating neutrophil migration and provide directions in alleviating systemic inflammation.	2019-09-10	2024-03-06 20:00:10	2024-03-06T20:00:10Z		18561-18570		37	116		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31451657 PMCID: PMC6744913					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2; Disease Models, Animal; Down-Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Larva; MicroRNAs; Neutrophils; Primary Cell Culture; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome; Zebrafish; chemotaxis; cyclin-dependent kinase 2; innate immunity; microRNA; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
FX9BZNG9	journalArticle	2019	Zayed, Yara; Qi, Xin; Peng, Chun	Identification of Novel MicroRNAs and Characterization of MicroRNA Expression Profiles in Zebrafish Ovarian Follicular Cells	Frontiers in Endocrinology		1664-2392	10.3389/fendo.2019.00518		MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression primarily at the post-transcriptional levels and thereby play important roles in regulating many physiological and developmental processes. Oocyte maturation in fish is induced by hormones produced from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn, induces the secretion of maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) from the ovary. It is documented that small early vitellogenic (or stage IIIa) follicles are unable to undergo oocyte maturation whereas oocytes in mid- to late vitellogenic (stage IIIb) follicles can be induced by LH and MIH to become mature. To determine whether miRNAs may be involved in the growth and acquisition of maturational competency of ovarian follicles, we determined the miRNA expression profiles in follicular cells collected from stage IIIa and IIIb follicles using next-generation sequencing. It was found that miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the follicular cells from both stages IIIa and IIIb follicles. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of 214 known, 31 conserved novel and 44 novel miRNAs in zebrafish vitellogenic ovarian follicular cells. Most mature miRNAs in follicular cells were found to be in the length of 22 nucleotides. Differential expression analysis revealed that 11 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and 13 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in the stage IIIb follicular cells as compared with stage IIIa follicular cells. The expression of four of the significantly regulated miRNAs, dre-miR-22a-3p, dre-miR-16a, dre-miR-181a-3p, and dre-miR-29a, was validated by real-time PCR. Finally, gene enrichment and pathway analyses of the predicted targets of the significantly regulated miRNAs supported the involvement of several key signaling pathways in regulating ovarian function, including oocyte maturation. Taken together, this study identifies novel zebrafish miRNAs and characterizes miRNA expression profiles in somatic cells within the zebrafish ovarian follicles. The differential expression of miRNAs between stage IIIa and IIIb follicular cells suggests that these miRNAs are important regulators of zebrafish ovarian follicle development and/or oocyte maturation.	2019	2024-03-06 20:00:09	2024-03-06T20:00:09Z		518			10		Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31417497 PMCID: PMC6684945					RNA-seq; follicle development; microRNAs; oocyte maturation; ovarian follicles; zebrafish

H3K27me3-mediated silencing of structural genes is required for zebrafish heart regeneration	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.178632		Deciphering the genetic and epigenetic regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation in organisms that are capable of robust cardiac renewal, such as zebrafish, represents an attractive inroad towards regenerating the human heart. Using integrated high-throughput transcriptional and chromatin analyses, we have identified a strong association between H3K27me3 deposition and reduced sarcomere and cytoskeletal gene expression in proliferative cardiomyocytes following cardiac injury in zebrafish. To move beyond an association, we generated an inducible transgenic strain expressing a mutant version of histone 3, H3.3K27M, that inhibits H3K27me3 catalysis in cardiomyocytes during the regenerative window. Hearts comprising H3.3K27M-expressing cardiomyocytes fail to regenerate, with wound edge cells showing heightened expression of structural genes and prominent sarcomeres. Although cell cycle re-entry was unperturbed, cytokinesis and wound invasion were significantly compromised. Collectively, our study identifies H3K27me3-mediated silencing of structural genes as requisite for zebrafish heart regeneration and suggests that repression of similar structural components in the border zone of an infarcted human heart might improve its regenerative capacity.	2019-10-09	2024-03-06 20:00:09	2024-03-06T20:00:09Z		dev178632		19	146		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31427288 PMCID: PMC6803378					Animals; Cardiomyocyte; Cardiovascular; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin; Cytokinesis; Cytoskeleton; Epigenetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Silencing; H3K27me3; Heart; Heart regeneration; Histones; Lysine; Methylation; Myocytes, Cardiac; Proliferation; Regeneration; Sarcomeres; Zebrafish

The emerging contaminant 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB-11) impedes Ahr activation and Cyp1a activity to modify embryotoxicity of Ahr ligands in the zebrafish embryo model (Danio rerio)	Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex: 1987)		1873-6424	10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113027		3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB-11) is an emerging PCB congener widely detected in environmental samples and human serum, but its toxicity potential is poorly understood. We assessed the effects of three concentrations of PCB-11 on embryotoxicity and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) pathway interactions in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Wildtype AB or transgenic Tg(gut:GFP) strain zebrafish embryos were exposed to static concentrations of PCB-11 (0, 0.2, 2, or 20 μM) from 24 to 96 h post fertilization (hpf), and gross morphology, Cytochrome P4501a (Cyp1a) activity, and liver development were assessed via microscopy. Ahr interactions were probed via co-exposures with PCB-126 or beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). Embryos exposed to 20 μM PCB-11 were also collected for PCB-11 body burden, qRT-PCR, RNAseq, and histology. Zebrafish exposed to 20 μM PCB-11 absorbed 0.18% PCB-11 per embryo at 28 hpf and 0.61% by 96 hpf, and their media retained 1.36% PCB-11 at 28 hpf and 0.84% at 96 hpf. This concentration did not affect gross morphology, but altered the transcription of xenobiotic metabolism and liver development genes, impeded liver development, and increased hepatocyte vacuole formation. In co-exposures, 20 μM PCB-11 prevented deformities caused by PCB-126 but exacerbated deformities in co-exposures with BNF. This study suggests that PCB-11 can affect liver development, act as a partial agonist/antagonist of the Ahr pathway, and act as an antagonist of Cyp1a activity to modify the toxicity of compounds that interact with the Ahr pathway.	2019-11	2024-03-06 20:00:09	2024-03-06T20:00:09Z		113027		Pt A	254		Environ Pollut								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31421573 PMCID: PMC7027435					3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) pathway; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Danio rerio; Developmental toxicity; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Ligands; Mixtures; PCB-11; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Toxicity Tests; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Approximately 10% of cases exhibit familial predisposition, but causative genes are not known in most families2. We perform whole-genome sequence analysis in a family with multiple cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and identify a germline truncating mutation in the member of the RAS oncogene family-like 3 (RABL3) gene. Heterozygous rabl3 mutant zebrafish show increased susceptibility to cancer formation. Transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches implicate RABL3 in RAS pathway regulation and identify an interaction with RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), a chaperone regulating prenylation of RAS GTPases3. Indeed, the truncated mutant RABL3 protein accelerates KRAS prenylation and requires RAS proteins to promote cell proliferation. Finally, evidence in patient cohorts with developmental disorders implicates germline RABL3 mutations in RASopathy syndromes. Our studies identify RABL3 mutations as a target for genetic testing in cancer families and uncover a mechanism for dysregulated RAS activity in development and cancer.	2019-09	2024-03-06 20:00:08	2024-03-06T20:00:08Z		1308-1314		9	51		Nat Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31406347 PMCID: PMC7159804					Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Carcinoma; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cell Proliferation; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pedigree; Prenylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Sequence Homology; Zebrafish; rab GTP-Binding Proteins

A Hormone That Lost Its Receptor: Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) in Zebrafish Gonad Development and Sex Determination	Genetics		1943-2631	10.1534/genetics.119.302365		Fetal mammalian testes secrete Anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh), which inhibits female reproductive tract (Müllerian duct) development. Amh also derives from mature mammalian ovarian follicles, which marks oocyte reserve and characterizes polycystic ovarian syndrome. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) lacks Müllerian ducts and the Amh receptor gene amhr2 but, curiously, retains amh To discover the roles of Amh in the absence of Müllerian ducts and the ancestral receptor gene, we made amh null alleles in zebrafish. Results showed that normal amh prevents female-biased sex ratios. Adult male amh mutants had enormous testes, half of which contained immature oocytes, demonstrating that Amh regulates male germ cell accumulation and inhibits oocyte development or survival. Mutant males formed sperm ducts and some produced a few offspring. Young female mutants laid a few fertile eggs, so they also had functional sex ducts. Older amh mutants accumulated nonvitellogenic follicles in exceedingly large but sterile ovaries, showing that Amh helps control ovarian follicle maturation and proliferation. RNA-sequencing data partitioned juveniles at 21 days postfertilization (dpf) into two groups that each contained mutant and wild-type fish. Group21-1 upregulated ovary genes compared to Group21-2, which were likely developing as males. By 35 dpf, transcriptomes distinguished males from females and, within each sex, mutants from wild types. In adult mutants, ovaries greatly underexpressed granulosa and theca genes, and testes underexpressed Leydig cell genes. These results show that ancestral Amh functions included development of the gonadal soma in ovaries and testes and regulation of gamete proliferation and maturation. A major gap in our understanding is the identity of the gene encoding a zebrafish Amh receptor; we show here that the loss of amhr2 is associated with the breakpoint of a chromosome rearrangement shared among cyprinid fishes.	2019-10	2024-03-06 20:00:07	2024-03-06T20:00:07Z		529-553		2	213		Genetics	A Hormone That Lost Its Receptor							eng					PubMed		PMID: 31399485 PMCID: PMC6781894					Animals; Anti-Mullerian Hormone; Female; Genetics of Sex; Genitalia, Female; Gonads; Mullerian Ducts; Ovarian Follicle; Ovary; PGC; RNA-Seq; Receptors, Peptide; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Sex Determination Processes; Zebrafish; female fertility; germ cells; gonad development; male fertility

Despite being integral to arteries, it is controversial whether HE and arterial endothelium share a common lineage. Here, we present a transgenic zebrafish runx1 reporter line to isolate HE and aortic roof endothelium (ARE)s, excluding non-aortic endothelium. Transcriptomic analysis of these populations identifies Runx1-regulated genes and shows that HE initially expresses arterial markers at similar levels to ARE. Furthermore, runx1 expression depends on prior arterial programming by the Notch ligand dll4. Runx1-/- mutants fail to downregulate arterial genes in the HE, which remains integrated within the DA, suggesting that Runx1 represses the pre-existing arterial programme in HE to allow progression towards the haematopoietic fate. These findings strongly suggest that, in zebrafish, aortic endothelium is a precursor to HE, with potential implications for pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols for the generation of transplantable HSCs.	2019-08-08	2024-03-06 20:00:07	2024-03-06T20:00:07Z		3577		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31395869 PMCID: PMC6687740					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Arteries; Cell Lineage; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Endothelium, Vascular; Gene Knockout Techniques; Hemangioblasts; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, we studied macrophage subtypes during organ regeneration in the zebrafish, an animal model with a high regenerative capacity. We identified a macrophage subpopulation expressing Wilms tumor 1b (wt1b), which accumulates within regenerating tissues. This wt1b+ macrophage population exhibited an overall pro-regenerative gene expression profile and different migratory behavior compared to the remainder of the macrophages. Functional studies showed that wt1b regulates macrophage migration and retention at the injury area. Furthermore, wt1b-null mutant zebrafish presented signs of impaired macrophage differentiation, delayed fin growth upon caudal fin amputation, and reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation following cardiac injury that correlated with altered macrophage recruitment to the regenerating areas. We describe a pro-regenerative macrophage subtype in the zebrafish and a role for wt1b in organ regeneration.	2019-07-30	2024-03-06 20:00:06	2024-03-06T20:00:06Z		1296-1306.e6		5	28		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31365871 PMCID: PMC6685527					Animal Fins; Animals; Heart; Macrophages; Regeneration; WT1 Proteins; Wilms tumor 1b; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; fin regeneration; heart regeneration; macrophages; zebrafish

However, it is currently unclear how evolutionarily conserved these processes are. Here we characterise the DNA methylomes of zebrafish PGCs at four developmental stages and identify retention of paternal epigenetic memory, in stark contrast to the findings in mammals. Gene expression profiling of zebrafish PGCs at the same developmental stages revealed that the embryonic germline is defined by a small number of markers that display strong developmental stage-specificity and that are independent of DNA methylation-mediated regulation. We identified promoters that are specifically targeted by DNA methylation in somatic and germline tissues during vertebrate embryogenesis and that are frequently misregulated in human cancers. Together, these detailed methylome and transcriptome maps of the zebrafish germline provide insight into vertebrate DNA methylation reprogramming and enhance our understanding of the relationships between germline fate acquisition and oncogenesis.	2019-07-11	2024-03-06 20:00:05	2024-03-06T20:00:05Z		3054		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31296860 PMCID: PMC6624265					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; DNA Methylation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Germ Cells; Paternal Inheritance; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Whole Genome Sequencing; Zebrafish

Here, we report a genome-wide analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in sub-Saharan Africans, an understudied ancestral group. We analyze ~18 million autosomal SNPs in 5,231 individuals from Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. We identify a previously-unreported genome-wide significant locus: ZRANB3 (Zinc Finger RANBP2-Type Containing 3, lead SNP p = 2.831 × 10-9). Knockdown or genomic knockout of the zebrafish ortholog results in reduction in pancreatic β-cell number which we demonstrate to be due to increased apoptosis in islets. siRNA transfection of murine Zranb3 in MIN6 β-cells results in impaired insulin secretion in response to high glucose, implicating Zranb3 in β-cell functional response to high glucose conditions. We also show transferability in our study of 32 established T2D loci. Our findings advance understanding of the genetics of T2D in non-European ancestry populations.	2019-07-19	2024-03-06 20:00:05	2024-03-06T20:00:05Z		3195		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31324766 PMCID: PMC6642147					Africa, Northern; Animals; Apoptosis; Base Sequence; Blood Glucose; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DNA Helicases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Editing; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Ghana; Glucose; Homozygote; Humans; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Kenya; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Mutation; Nigeria; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA, Small Interfering; Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Pioneer and repressive functions of p63 during zebrafish embryonic ectoderm specification	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-019-11121-z		The transcription factor p63 is a master regulator of ectoderm development. Although previous studies show that p63 triggers epidermal differentiation in vitro, the roles of p63 in developing embryos remain poorly understood. Here, we use zebrafish embryos to analyze in vivo how p63 regulates gene expression during development. We generate tp63-knock-out mutants that recapitulate human phenotypes and show down-regulated epidermal gene expression. Following p63-binding dynamics, we find two distinct functions clearly separated in space and time. During early development, p63 binds enhancers associated to neural genes, limiting Sox3 binding and reducing neural gene expression. Indeed, we show that p63 and Sox3 are co-expressed in the neural plate border. On the other hand, p63 acts as a pioneer factor by binding non-accessible chromatin at epidermal enhancers, promoting their opening and epidermal gene expression in later developmental stages. Therefore, our results suggest that p63 regulates cell fate decisions during vertebrate ectoderm specification.	2019-07-11	2024-03-06 20:00:05	2024-03-06T20:00:05Z		3049		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31296872 PMCID: PMC6624255					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Differentiation; Chromatin; Down-Regulation; Ectoderm; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epidermis; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockout Techniques; Models, Animal; Neural Plate; Phosphoproteins; Protein Binding; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Trans-Activators; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

We find that in early development, the transcription factor foxc1b is expressed in mesenchymal cells that associate with the vascular endothelium. Using timelapse imaging, we observe that foxc1b expressing mesenchymal cells differentiate into acta2 expressing vascular mural cells. We show that in zebrafish, while foxc1b is co-expressed in acta2 positive smooth muscle cells that associate with large diameter vessels, it is not co-expressed in capillaries where pdgfrβ positive pericytes are located. In addition to being an early marker of the lineage, foxc1 is essential for vSMC differentiation; we find that foxc1 loss of function mutants have defective vSMC differentiation and that early genetic ablation of foxc1b or acta2 expressing populations blocks vSMC differentiation. Furthermore, foxc1 is expressed upstream of acta2 and is required for acta2 expression in vSMCs. Using RNA-Seq we determine an enriched intersectional gene expression profile using dual expression of foxc1b and acta2 to identify novel vSMC markers. Taken together, our data suggests that foxc1 is a marker of vSMCs and plays a critical functional role in promoting their differentiation.	2019-09-01	2024-03-06 20:00:04	2024-03-06T20:00:04Z		34-47		1	453		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31199900					Animals; Brain; CRISPR; Cell Differentiation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelium; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Head; Mesoderm; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Pericytes; RNA-Seq transcriptome; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Vascular smooth muscle cell; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; acta2; foxc1b

Transcriptional profiling of the zebrafish proximal tubule	American Journal of Physiology. Renal Physiology		1522-1466	10.1152/ajprenal.00174.2019		The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (Hnf1b) transcription factor is a key regulator of kidney tubule formation and is associated with a syndrome of renal cysts and early onset diabetes. To further our understanding of Hnf1b in the developing zebrafish kidney, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of proximal tubules from hnf1b-deficient larvae. This analysis revealed an enrichment of gene transcripts encoding transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, including multiple members of slc2 and slc5 glucose transporters. An investigation of expression of slc2a1a, slc2a2, and slc5a2 as well as a poorly studied glucose/mannose transporter encoded by slc5a9 revealed that these genes undergo dynamic spatiotemporal changes during tubule formation and maturation. A comparative analysis of zebrafish SLC genes with those expressed in mouse proximal tubules showed a substantial overlap at the level of gene families, indicating a high degree of functional conservation between zebrafish and mammalian proximal tubules. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a role for Hnf1b as a critical determinant of proximal tubule transport function by acting upstream of a large number of SLC genes and validate the zebrafish as a physiologically relevant model of the mammalian proximal tubule.	2019-08-01	2024-03-06 20:00:04	2024-03-06T20:00:04Z		F478-F488		2	317		Am J Physiol Renal Physiol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31188030					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carrier Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Larva; Mice; RNA; RNA sequencing; Species Specificity; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; kidney; proximal tubule; solute carriers; zebrafish

However, AgRP has also been detected in circulation, but a possible endocrine role has not been examined. Zebrafish possess two agrp genes: hypothalamically expressed agrp1, considered functionally equivalent to the single mammalian agrp, and agrp2, which is expressed in pre-optic neurons and uncharacterized pineal gland cells and whose function is not well understood. By ablation of AgRP1-expressing neurons and knockout of the agrp1 gene, we show that AgRP1 stimulates food consumption in the zebrafish larvae. Single-cell sequencing of pineal agrp2-expressing cells revealed molecular resemblance to retinal-pigment epithelium cells, and anatomic analysis shows that these cells secrete peptides, possibly into the cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, based on AgRP2 peptide localization and gene knockout analysis, we demonstrate that pre-optic AgRP2 is a neuroendocrine regulator of the stress axis that reduces cortisol secretion. We therefore suggest that the ancestral role of AgRP was functionally partitioned in zebrafish by the two AgRPs, with AgRP1 centrally regulating food consumption and AgRP2 acting as a neuroendocrine factor regulating the stress axis.	2019-06-17	2024-03-06 20:00:03	2024-03-06T20:00:03Z		2009-2019.e7		12	29		Curr Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31178320 PMCID: PMC8287899					Animals; Gene Knockout Techniques; Hypothalamus; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Pineal Gland; Stress, Physiological; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; circadian clock; cortisol; food consumption; gene knockout; hypothalamus; neuronal ablation; pineal gland; single-cell RNA sequencing; transgenesis; zebrafish

RNA sequencing of isolated cell populations expressing human APOL1 G2 risk variant reveals molecular correlates of sickle cell nephropathy in zebrafish podocytes	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0217042		Kidney failure occurs in 5-13% of individuals with sickle cell disease and is associated with early mortality. Two APOL1 alleles (G1 and G2) have been identified as risk factors for sickle cell disease nephropathy. Both risk alleles are prevalent in individuals with recent African ancestry and have been associated with nephropathic complications in other diseases. Despite the association of G1 and G2 with kidney dysfunction, the mechanisms by which these variants contribute to increased risk remain poorly understood. Previous work in zebrafish models suggest that the G2 risk allele functions as a dominant negative, whereas the G1 allele is a functional null. To understand better the cellular pathology attributed to APOL1 G2, we investigated the in vivo effects of the G2 risk variant on distinct cell types using RNA sequencing. We surveyed APOL1 G2 associated transcriptomic alterations in podocytes and vascular endothelial cells isolated from zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type specific reporters. Our analysis identified many transcripts (n = 7,523) showing differential expression between APOL1 G0 (human wild-type) and APOL1 G2 exposed podocytes. Conversely, relatively few transcripts (n = 107) were differentially expressed when comparing APOL1 G0 and APOL1 G2 exposed endothelial cells. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed transcripts in podocytes showed enrichment for autophagy associated terms such as "Lysosome" and "Phagosome", implicating these pathways in APOL1 G2 associated kidney dysfunction. This work provides insight into the molecular pathology of APOL1 G2 nephropathy which may offer new therapeutic strategies for multiple disease contexts such as sickle cell nephropathy.	2019	2024-03-06 20:00:02	2024-03-06T20:00:02Z		e0217042		6	14		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31158233 PMCID: PMC6546218					Anemia, Sickle Cell; Animals; Apolipoprotein L1; Gene Expression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Larva; Podocytes; RNA, Messenger; Risk; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Fate plasticity and reprogramming in genetically distinct populations of Danio leucophores	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1901021116		Understanding genetic and cellular bases of adult form remains a fundamental goal at the intersection of developmental and evolutionary biology. The skin pigment cells of vertebrates, derived from embryonic neural crest, are a useful system for elucidating mechanisms of fate specification, pattern formation, and how particular phenotypes impact organismal behavior and ecology. In a survey of Danio fishes, including the zebrafish Danio rerio, we identified two populations of white pigment cells-leucophores-one of which arises by transdifferentiation of adult melanophores and another of which develops from a yellow-orange xanthophore or xanthophore-like progenitor. Single-cell transcriptomic, mutational, chemical, and ultrastructural analyses of zebrafish leucophores revealed cell-type-specific chemical compositions, organelle configurations, and genetic requirements. At the organismal level, we identified distinct physiological responses of leucophores during environmental background matching, and we showed that leucophore complement influences behavior. Together, our studies reveal independently arisen pigment cell types and mechanisms of fate acquisition in zebrafish and illustrate how concerted analyses across hierarchical levels can provide insights into phenotypes and their evolution.	2019-06-11	2024-03-06 20:00:02	2024-03-06T20:00:02Z		11806-11811		24	116		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31138706 PMCID: PMC6575160					Animals; Cell Plasticity; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetics, Population; Melanophores; Mutation; Neural Crest; Phenotype; Pigmentation; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; evolution; neural crest; pigmentation; transdifferentiation; zebrafish

Coupling Genome-wide Transcriptomics and Developmental Toxicity Profiles in Zebrafish to Characterize Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Hazard	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms20102570		Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are diverse environmental pollutants associated with adverse human health effects. Many studies focus on the carcinogenic effects of a limited number of PAHs and there is an increasing need to understand mechanisms of developmental toxicity of more varied yet environmentally relevant PAHs. A previous study characterized the developmental toxicity of 123 PAHs in zebrafish. Based on phenotypic responses ranging from complete inactivity to acute mortality, we classified these PAHs into eight bins, selected 16 representative PAHs, and exposed developing zebrafish to the concentration of each PAH that induced 80% phenotypic effect. We conducted RNA sequencing at 48 h post fertilization to identify gene expression changes as a result of PAH exposure. Using the Context Likelihood of Relatedness algorithm, we inferred a network that links the PAHs based on coordinated gene responses to PAH exposure. The 16 PAHs formed two broad clusters: Cluster A was transcriptionally more similar to the controls, while Cluster B consisted of PAHs that were generally more developmentally toxic, significantly elevated cyp1a transcript levels, and induced Ahr2-dependent Cyp1a protein expression in the skin confirmed by gene-silencing studies. We found that cyp1a transcript levels were associated with transcriptomic response, but not with PAH developmental toxicity. While all cluster B PAHs predominantly activated Ahr2, they also each enriched unique pathways like ion transport signaling, which likely points to differing molecular events between the PAHs downstream of Ahr2. Thus, using a systems biology approach, we have begun to evaluate, classify, and define mechanisms of PAH toxicity.	2019-05-25	2024-03-06 20:00:01	2024-03-06T20:00:01Z		2570		10	20		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31130617 PMCID: PMC6566387					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Environmental Pollutants; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; PAHs; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; cyp1a; developmental toxicity; morpholino; transcriptomics; zebrafish

Genome-wide strategies reveal target genes of Npas4l associated with vascular development in zebrafish	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.173427		The development of a vascular network is essential to nourish tissues and sustain organ function throughout life. Endothelial cells (ECs) are the building blocks of blood vessels, yet our understanding of EC specification remains incomplete. Zebrafish cloche/npas4l mutants have been used broadly as an avascular model, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of action of the Npas4l transcription factor. Here, to identify its direct and indirect target genes, we have combined complementary genome-wide approaches, including transcriptome analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The cross-analysis of these datasets indicates that Npas4l functions as a master regulator by directly inducing a group of transcription factor genes that are crucial for hematoendothelial specification, such as etv2, tal1 and lmo2 We also identified new targets of Npas4l and investigated the function of a subset of them using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Phenotypic characterization of tspan18b mutants reveals a novel player in developmental angiogenesis, confirming the reliability of the datasets generated. Collectively, these data represent a useful resource for future studies aimed to better understand EC fate determination and vascular development.	2019-06-03	2024-03-06 20:00:00	2024-03-06T20:00:00Z		dev173427		11	146		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31097478					ATAC-seq; Angioblast; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Binding Sites; Cell Differentiation; ChIP-seq; Chromosome Mapping; Cloche; Datasets as Topic; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Endothelial cell differentiation; Endothelium, Vascular; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genomics; LIM Domain Proteins; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Npas4l; T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

HDAC1-mediated repression of the retinoic acid-responsive gene ripply3 promotes second heart field development	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1008165		Coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that direct development of the later differentiating second heart field (SHF) progenitors remain largely unknown. Here, we show that a novel zebrafish histone deacetylase 1 (hdac1) mutant allele cardiac really gone (crg) has a deficit of ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCs) and smooth muscle within the outflow tract (OFT) due to both cell and non-cell autonomous loss in SHF progenitor proliferation. Cyp26-deficient embryos, which have increased retinoic acid (RA) levels, have similar defects in SHF-derived OFT development. We found that nkx2.5+ progenitors from Hdac1 and Cyp26-deficient embryos have ectopic expression of ripply3, a transcriptional co-repressor of T-box transcription factors that is normally restricted to the posterior pharyngeal endoderm. Furthermore, the ripply3 expression domain is expanded anteriorly into the posterior nkx2.5+ progenitor domain in crg mutants. Importantly, excess ripply3 is sufficient to repress VC development, while genetic depletion of Ripply3 and Tbx1 in crg mutants can partially restore VC number. We find that the epigenetic signature at RA response elements (RAREs) that can associate with Hdac1 and RA receptors (RARs) becomes indicative of transcriptional activation in crg mutants. Our study highlights that transcriptional repression via the epigenetic regulator Hdac1 facilitates OFT development through directly preventing expression of the RA-responsive gene ripply3 within SHF progenitors.	2019-05	2024-03-06 19:59:59	2024-03-06T19:59:59Z		e1008165		5	15		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31091225 PMCID: PMC6538190					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart; Heart Ventricles; Histone Deacetylase 1; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organogenesis; Repressor Proteins; Stem Cells; Transcription Factors; Tretinoin; Ventricular Function; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

AD develops over decades but detailed molecular analysis of AD brains is limited to postmortem tissue where the stresses initiating the disease may be obscured by compensatory responses and neurodegenerative processes. Rare, dominant mutations in a small number of genes, but particularly the gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), drive early onset of familial AD (EOfAD). Numerous transgenic models of AD have been constructed in mouse and other organisms, but transcriptomic analysis of these models has raised serious doubts regarding their representation of the disease state. Since we lack clarity regarding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying AD, we posit that the most valid approach is to model the human EOfAD genetic state as closely as possible. Therefore, we sought to analyse brains from zebrafish heterozygous for a single, EOfAD-like mutation in their PSEN1-orthologous gene, psen1. We previously introduced an EOfAD-like mutation (Q96_K97del) into the endogenous psen1 gene of zebrafish. Here, we analysed transcriptomes of young adult (6-month-old) entire brains from a family of heterozygous mutant and wild type sibling fish. Gene ontology (GO) analysis implies effects on mitochondria, particularly ATP synthesis, and on ATP-dependent processes including vacuolar acidification.	2019-05-03	2024-03-06 19:59:59	2024-03-06T19:59:59Z		43		1	12		Mol Brain								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31053140 PMCID: PMC6500017					ATP synthesis; Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Animals; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Genome editing; Heterozygote; Humans; Mitochondria; Mutation; Presenilin 1; Presenilin-1; Transcriptome; Vacuolar acidification; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Glucocorticoids inhibit macrophage differentiation towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype upon wounding without affecting their migration	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.037887		Glucocorticoid drugs are widely used to treat immune-related diseases, but their use is limited by side effects and by resistance, which especially occurs in macrophage-dominated diseases. In order to improve glucocorticoid therapies, more research is required into the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action. In the present study, we have used a zebrafish model for inflammation to study glucocorticoid effects on the innate immune response. In zebrafish larvae, the migration of neutrophils towards a site of injury is inhibited upon glucocorticoid treatment, whereas migration of macrophages is glucocorticoid resistant. We show that wounding-induced increases in the expression of genes that encode neutrophil-specific chemoattractants (Il8 and Cxcl18b) are attenuated by the synthetic glucocorticoid beclomethasone, but that beclomethasone does not attenuate the induction of the genes encoding Ccl2 and Cxcl11aa, which are required for macrophage recruitment. RNA sequencing on FACS-sorted macrophages shows that the vast majority of the wounding-induced transcriptional changes in these cells are inhibited by beclomethasone, whereas only a small subset is glucocorticoid-insensitive. As a result, beclomethasone decreases the number of macrophages that differentiate towards a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype, which we demonstrated using a tnfa:eGFP-F reporter line and analysis of macrophage morphology. We conclude that differentiation and migration of macrophages are regulated independently, and that glucocorticoids leave the chemotactic migration of macrophages unaffected, but exert their anti-inflammatory effect on these cells by inhibiting their differentiation to an M1 phenotype. The resistance of macrophage-dominated diseases to glucocorticoid therapy can therefore not be attributed to an intrinsic insensitivity of macrophages to glucocorticoids.	2019-05-30	2024-03-06 19:59:59	2024-03-06T19:59:59Z		dmm037887		5	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31072958 PMCID: PMC6550045					Amputation, Surgical; Animals; Beclomethasone; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Tracking; Chemotactic Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucocorticoids; Inflammation; Larva; Leukocyte migration; Macrophage differentiation; Macrophages; Morpholinos; Neutrophils; Phenotype; Tail amputation; Transcriptome; Wound Healing; Zebrafish

Reduced incidence of solid tumors such as neuroblastoma in DS patients and increased vascular anomalies in DS fetuses suggest a potential role of DYRK1A in angiogenic processes, but in vivo evidence is still scarce. Here, we used zebrafish dyrk1aa mutant embryos to understand DYRK1A function in cerebral vasculature formation. Zebrafish dyrk1aa mutants exhibited cerebral hemorrhage and defects in angiogenesis of central arteries in the developing hindbrain. Such phenotypes were rescued by wild-type dyrk1aa mRNA, but not by a kinase-dead form, indicating the importance of DYRK1A kinase activity. Chemical screening using a bioactive small molecule library identified a calcium chelator, EGTA, as one of the hits that most robustly rescued the hemorrhage. Vascular defects of mutants were also rescued by independent modulation of calcium signaling by FK506. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analyses supported the alterations of calcium signaling networks in dyrk1aa mutants. Together, our results suggest that DYRK1A plays an essential role in angiogenesis and in maintenance of the developing cerebral vasculature via regulation of calcium signaling, which may have therapeutic potential for DYRK1A-related vascular diseases.	2019-05-23	2024-03-06 19:59:58	2024-03-06T19:59:58Z		dmm037044		5	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31043432 PMCID: PMC6550036					Animals; Blood Vessels; Brain; Calcium Signaling; Cerebral Hemorrhage; DYRK1A; Egtazic Acid; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Endothelial Cells; Gene Knockout Techniques; Harmine; Hemorrhage; Intracellular Space; Mutation; Phenotype; Protein Kinases; Transcriptome; Vascular development; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zebrafish embryo

We present here a transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed to different concentrations of PFOS (0.03-1.0 mg/L) from 48 to 120 hpf. No major survival or morphological alterations (swimming bladder inflation, kyphosis, eye separation and size…) were observed below the 1.0 mg/L mark. Conversely, we observed significant increase in transcripts related to lipid transport and metabolism even at the lowest used concentration. In addition, we observed a general decrease on transcripts related to natural immunity and defense again infections, which adds to the recent concerns about PFOS as immunotoxicant, particularly in humans. Derived PoD (Point of Departure) values for transcriptional changes (0.011 mg/L) were about 200-fold lower than the corresponding PoD values for morphometric effects (2.53 mg/L), and close to levels observed in human blood serum or bird eggs. Our data suggest that currently applicable tolerable levels of PFOS in commercial goods should be re-evaluated, taking into account its potential effects on lipid metabolism and the immune system.	2019-07-15	2024-03-06 19:59:58	2024-03-06T19:59:58Z		462-471			674		Sci Total Environ								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31022537					ANOVA-PLS; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Benchmark doses; Differentially expressed genes (DEGs); Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Profiling; High-throughput sequencing; Immune system; Lipid disruption; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

Yet, the heterogeneities of their origins and functions remain incompletely defined. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an ectoderm-derived myeloid-like cell, which we refer to as metaphocyte. We show that metaphocytes are highly similar to conventional Langerhans cells (cLCs), the resident macrophages in epidermis, in transcriptome, morphology, and anatomic location. However, unlike cLCs, metaphocytes respond neither to tissue injury nor to bacterial infection but rather sample soluble antigens from external environment through transepithelial protrusions and transfer them to cLCs via apoptosis-phagocytosis axis. This antigen transfer is critical for zebrafish to respond to soluble antigens because the depletion of metaphocytes significantly reduces cLC antigen uptake. Our study documents the existence of ectoderm-derived myeloid-like cells that manifest distinct function from conventional TRMs and opens a new paradigm for investigation of the heterogeneities of resident immune cells.	2019-05-20	2024-03-06 19:59:57	2024-03-06T19:59:57Z		605-617.e5		4	49		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31006648					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Ectoderm; Epidermal Cells; Epidermis; Langerhans Cells; Macrophages; Myeloid Cells; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; antigen uptake; epidermis; langerhans cells; metaphocytes; tissue-resident macrophages; zebrafish

It was reported recently that hedgehog (Hh) signaling and autophagy are two important regulators of bone differentiation. In order to further dissect their relationship in bone development, we used a zebrafish larvae model to investigate how disruption of one of these signals affects the function of the other and impacts osteoblast differentiation. Our results showed that activation of Hh signaling negatively regulated autophagy. However, suppression of autophagy by knocking down atg5 expression did not alter Hh signaling, but dramatically upregulated the expression of osteoblast-related genes and increased bone mineralization, especially in the den region. On the contrary, inhibition of the Hh signaling pathway by cyclopamine treatment suppressed the expression of osteoblast-related genes and decreased bone mineralization. In agreement with these findings, blocking Hh signaling through knockdown SHH and Gli2 genes led to defective osteoblast differentiation, while promoting Hh signaling by knockdown Ptch1 was beneficial to osteoblast differentiation. Our results thus support that activation of the Hh signaling pathway negatively regulates autophagy and consequentially promotes osteoblast differentiation. On the contrary, induction of autophagy inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Our work reveals the mechanism underlying Hh signaling pathway regulation of bone development.	2019-05-01	2024-03-06 19:59:57	2024-03-06T19:59:57Z		bio040840		5	8		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30992325 PMCID: PMC6550075					Autophagy; BMP2; Gli2; Hh signaling; Mineralization; Osteoblast; Ptch1; SHH; Zebrafish; atg5

However, little is known about whether Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PTP) are involved in this process. Here, we show that zebrafish sec14l3, one of the family members, specifically participates in artery and vein formation via regulating angioblasts and subsequent venous progenitors' migration during vasculogenesis. Vascular defects caused by sec14l3 depletion are partially rescued by restoration of VEGFR2 signaling at the receptor or downstream effector level. Biochemical analyses show that Sec14l3/SEC14L2 physically bind to VEGFR2 and prevent it from dephosphorylation specifically at the Y1175 site by peri-membrane tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, therefore potentiating VEGFR2 signaling activation. Meanwhile, Sec14l3 and SEC14L2 interact with RAB5A/4A and facilitate the formation of their GTP-bound states, which might be critical for VEGFR2 endocytic trafficking. Thus, we conclude that Sec14l3 controls vasculogenesis in zebrafish via the regulation of VEGFR2 activation.	2019-04-08	2024-03-06 19:59:57	2024-03-06T19:59:57Z		1606		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30962435 PMCID: PMC6453981					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carrier Proteins; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lipoproteins; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Phospholipid Transfer Proteins; Signal Transduction; Trans-Activators; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins

Phenotypic Landscape of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Defines Candidates and Their Shared Functions	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.048		Genomic studies have identified hundreds of candidate genes near loci associated with risk for schizophrenia. To define candidates and their functions, we mutated zebrafish orthologs of 132 human schizophrenia-associated genes. We created a phenotype atlas consisting of whole-brain activity maps, brain structural differences, and profiles of behavioral abnormalities. Phenotypes were diverse but specific, including altered forebrain development and decreased prepulse inhibition. Exploration of these datasets identified promising candidates in more than 10 gene-rich regions, including the magnesium transporter cnnm2 and the translational repressor gigyf2, and revealed shared anatomical sites of activity differences, including the pallium, hypothalamus, and tectum. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered an essential role for the understudied transcription factor znf536 in the development of forebrain neurons implicated in social behavior and stress. This phenotypic landscape of schizophrenia-associated genes prioritizes more than 30 candidates for further study and provides hypotheses to bridge the divide between genetic association and biological mechanism.	2019-04-04	2024-03-06 19:59:56	2024-03-06T19:59:56Z		478-491.e20		2	177		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30929901 PMCID: PMC6494450					Animals; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Disease Models, Animal; GWAS; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia; Zebrafish; behavior; forebrain; neurodevelopment; neuropsychiatric disorder; prepulse inhibition; schizophrenia; single-cell RNA-sequencing; whole-brain activity; zebrafish

Genetic control of cellular morphogenesis in Müller glia	Glia		1098-1136	10.1002/glia.23615		Cell shape is critical for the proper function of every cell in every tissue in the body. This is especially true for the highly morphologically diverse neural and glia cells of the central nervous system. The molecular processes by which these, or indeed any, cells gain their particular cell-specific morphology remain largely unexplored. To identify the genes involved in the morphogenesis of the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate retina, the Müller glia (MG), we used genomic and CRISPR based strategies in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We identified 41 genes involved in various aspects of MG cell morphogenesis and revealed a striking concordance between the sequential steps of anatomical feature addition and the expression of cohorts of functionally related genes that regulate these steps. We noted that the many of the genes preferentially expressed in zebrafish MG showed conservation in glia across species suggesting evolutionarily conserved glial developmental pathways.	2019-07	2024-03-06 19:59:56	2024-03-06T19:59:56Z		1401-1411		7	67		Glia								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30924555 PMCID: PMC6563441					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; CRISPR; Cell Differentiation; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Ependymoglial Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Morphogenesis; Müller glia; Neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; morphogenesis; transcriptome; zebrafish

RNA quality and yield are key determinant factors for accurate expression profiling. Limited cell number and FACS induced cellular stress make RNA isolation of sorted zebrafish cells a delicate process. We aimed to optimize a workflow to extract sufficient amounts of high-quality RNA from a limited number of FACS sorted cells from Tg(fli1a:GFP) zebrafish embryos, which can be used for accurate gene expression analysis. RESULTS: We evaluated two suitable RNA isolation kits (the RNAqueous micro and the RNeasy plus micro kit) and determined that sorting cells directly into lysis buffer is a critical step for success. For low cell numbers, this ensures direct cell lysis, protects RNA from degradation and results in a higher RNA quality and yield. We showed that this works well up to 0.5× dilution of the lysis buffer with sorted cells. In our sort settings, this corresponded to 30,000 and 75,000 cells for the RNAqueous micro kit and RNeasy plus micro kit respectively. Sorting more cells dilutes the lysis buffer too much and requires the use of a collection buffer. We also demonstrated that an additional genomic DNA removal step after RNA isolation is required to completely clear the RNA from any contaminating genomic DNA. For cDNA synthesis and library preparation, we combined SmartSeq v4 full length cDNA library amplification, Nextera XT tagmentation and sample barcoding. Using this workflow, we were able to generate highly reproducible RNA sequencing results. CONCLUSIONS: The presented optimized workflow enables to generate high quality RNA and allows accurate transcriptome profiling of small populations of sorted zebrafish cells.	2019-03-20	2024-03-06 19:59:55	2024-03-06T19:59:55Z		228		1	20		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30894119 PMCID: PMC6425699					Animals; Cell Count; FACS sorting; Flow Cytometry; Poly A; Quality Control; RNA; RNA isolation; RNA sequencing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Enhancing regeneration after acute kidney injury by promoting cellular dedifferentiation in zebrafish	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.037390		Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious disorder for which there are limited treatment options. Following injury, native nephrons display limited regenerative capabilities, relying on the dedifferentiation and proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) that survive the insult. Previously, we identified 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI), as an enhancer of renal recovery, and showed that PTBA treatment increased RTEC proliferation and reduced renal fibrosis. Here, we investigated the regenerative mechanisms of PTBA in zebrafish models of larval renal injury and adult cardiac injury. With respect to renal injury, we showed that delivery of PTBA using an esterified prodrug (UPHD25) increases the reactivation of the renal progenitor gene Pax2a, enhances dedifferentiation of RTECs, reduces Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) expression, and lowers the number of infiltrating macrophages. Further, we found that the effects of PTBA on RTEC proliferation depend upon retinoic acid signaling and demonstrate that the therapeutic properties of PTBA are not restricted to the kidney but also increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and decrease fibrosis following cardiac injury in adult zebrafish. These studies provide key mechanistic insights into how PTBA enhances tissue repair in models of acute injury and lay the groundwork for translating this novel HDI into the clinic.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.	2019-04-05	2024-03-06 19:59:55	2024-03-06T19:59:55Z		dmm037390		4	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30890583 PMCID: PMC6505474					Acute Kidney Injury; Acute kidney injury; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Butyrates; Cardiovascular; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial Cells; HDAC inhibitor; Immune System; Kidney Tubules; Macrophages; Neutrophils; PAX2 Transcription Factor; Prodrugs; Regeneration; Renal proximal tubule cell; Signal Transduction; Sulfides; Therapeutic; Tretinoin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Regeneration associated transcriptional signature of retinal microglia and macrophages	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-019-41298-8		Zebrafish have the remarkable capacity to regenerate retinal neurons following a variety of damage paradigms. Following initial tissue insult and a period of cell death, a proliferative phase ensues that generates neuronal progenitors, which ultimately regenerate damaged neurons. Recent work has revealed that Müller glia are the source of regenerated neurons in zebrafish. However, the roles of another important class of glia present in the retina, microglia, during this regenerative phase remain elusive. Here, we examine retinal tissue and perform QuantSeq. 3'mRNA sequencing/transcriptome analysis to reveal localization and putative functions, respectively, of mpeg1 expressing cells (microglia/macrophages) during Müller glia-mediated regeneration, corresponding to a time of progenitor proliferation and production of new neurons. Our results indicate that in this regenerative state, mpeg1-expressing cells are located in regions containing regenerative Müller glia and are likely engaged in active vesicle trafficking. Further, mpeg1+ cells congregate at and around the optic nerve head. Our transcriptome analysis reveals several novel genes not previously described in microglia. This dataset represents the first report, to our knowledge, to use RNA sequencing to probe the microglial transcriptome in such context, and therefore provides a resource towards understanding microglia/macrophage function during successful retinal (and central nervous tissue) regeneration.	2019-03-18	2024-03-06 19:59:26	2024-03-06T19:59:26Z		4768		1	9		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30886241 PMCID: PMC6423051					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Ependymoglial Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Membrane Proteins; Microglia; Nerve Regeneration; Neural Stem Cells; Retina; Retinal Neurons; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Loss of the Polycomb group protein Rnf2 results in derepression of tbx-transcription factors and defects in embryonic and cardiac development	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-019-40867-1		The Polycomb group (PcG) protein family is a well-known group of epigenetic modifiers. We used zebrafish to investigate the role of Rnf2, the enzymatic subunit of PRC1. We found a positive correlation between loss of Rnf2 and upregulation of genes, especially of those whose promoter is normally bound by Rnf2. The heart of rnf2 mutants shows a tubular shaped morphology and to further understand the underlying mechanism, we studied gene expression of single wildtype and rnf2 mutant hearts. We detected the most pronounced differences at 3 dpf, including upregulation of heart transcription factors, such as tbx2a, tbx2b, and tbx3a. These tbx genes were decorated by broad PcG domains in wildtype whole embryo lysates. Chamber specific genes such as vmhc, myh6, and nppa showed downregulation in rnf2 mutant hearts. The marker of the working myocard, nppa, is negatively regulated by Tbx2 and Tbx3. Based on our findings and literature we postulate that loss of Rnf2-mediated repression results in upregulation and ectopic expression of tbx2/3, whose expression is normally restricted to the cardiac conductive system. This could lead to repression of chamber specific gene expression, a misbalance in cardiac cell types, and thereby to cardiac defects observed in rnf2 mutants.	2019-03-13	2024-03-06 19:59:26	2024-03-06T19:59:26Z		4327		1	9		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30867528 PMCID: PMC6416260					Animals; Embryonic Development; Heart; Mutation; T-Box Domain Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Selective Roles of Vertebrate PCF11 in Premature and Full-Length Transcript Termination	Molecular Cell		1097-4164	10.1016/j.molcel.2019.01.027		The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination.	2019-04-04	2024-03-06 19:59:25	2024-03-06T19:59:25Z		158-172.e9		1	74		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30819644 PMCID: PMC6458999					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Binding Sites; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mutation; PCF11; Polyadenylation; Protein Binding; RNA 3′ processing; RNA Cleavage; RNA Polymerase II; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Termination, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; alternative polyadenylation; attenuation; autoregulation; human; mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors; premature termination; regulation of gene expression; transcription termination; zebrafish

Dynamics of cardiomyocyte transcriptome and chromatin landscape demarcates key events of heart development	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.244491.118		Organogenesis involves dynamic regulation of gene transcription and complex multipathway interactions. Despite our knowledge of key factors regulating various steps of heart morphogenesis, considerable challenges in understanding its mechanism still exist because little is known about their downstream targets and interactive regulatory network. To better understand transcriptional regulatory mechanism driving heart development and the consequences of its disruption in vivo, we performed time-series analyses of the transcriptome and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in isolated cardiomyocytes (CMs) from wild-type zebrafish embryos at developmental stages corresponding to heart tube morphogenesis, looping, and maturation. We identified genetic regulatory modules driving crucial events of heart development that contained key cardiac TFs and are associated with open chromatin regions enriched for DNA sequence motifs belonging to the family of the corresponding TFs. Loss of function of cardiac TFs Gata5, Tbx5a, and Hand2 affected the cardiac regulatory networks and caused global changes in chromatin accessibility profile, indicating their role in heart development. Among regions with differential chromatin accessibility in mutants were highly conserved noncoding elements that represent putative enhancers driving heart development. The most prominent gene expression changes, which correlated with chromatin accessibility modifications within their proximal promoter regions, occurred between heart tube morphogenesis and looping, and were associated with metabolic shift and hematopoietic/cardiac fate switch during CM maturation. Our results revealed the dynamic regulatory landscape throughout heart development and identified interactive molecular networks driving key events of heart morphogenesis.	2019-03	2024-03-06 19:59:25	2024-03-06T19:59:25Z		506-519		3	29		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30760547 PMCID: PMC6396412					Animals; Cells, Cultured; Chromatin; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Heart; Myocytes, Cardiac; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcriptome profiling of zebrafish optic fissure fusion	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-018-38379-5		Incomplete fusion of the optic fissure leads to ocular coloboma, a congenital eye defect that affects up to 7.5 per 10,000 births and accounts for up to 10 percent of childhood blindness. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that facilitate optic fissure fusion remain elusive. We have profiled global gene expression during optic fissure morphogenesis by transcriptome analysis of tissue dissected from the margins of the zebrafish optic fissure and the opposing dorsal retina before (32 hours post fertilisation, hpf), during (48 hpf) and after (56 hpf) optic fissure fusion. Differential expression analysis between optic fissure and dorsal retinal tissue resulted in the detection of several known and novel developmental genes. The expression of selected genes was validated by qRT-PCR analysis and localisation investigated using in situ hybridisation. We discuss significantly overrepresented functional ontology categories in the context of optic fissure morphogenesis and highlight interesting transcripts from hierarchical clustering for subsequent analysis. We have identified netrin1a (ntn1a) as highly differentially expressed across optic fissure fusion, with a resultant ocular coloboma phenotype following morpholino antisense translation-blocking knockdown and downstream disruption of atoh7 expression. To support the identification of candidate genes in human studies, we have generated an online open-access resource for fast and simple quantitative querying of the gene expression data. Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the zebrafish optic fissure transcriptome and provides a valuable resource to facilitate our understanding of the complex aetiology of ocular coloboma.	2019-02-07	2024-03-06 19:59:25	2024-03-06T19:59:25Z		1541		1	9		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30733552 PMCID: PMC6367446					Animals; Cluster Analysis; Coloboma; DNA-Binding Proteins; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Morpholinos; Netrin-1; Principal Component Analysis; Retina; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Cortisol Acting Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor Is Not Involved in Exercise-Enhanced Growth, But Does Affect the White Skeletal Muscle Transcriptome in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)	Frontiers in Physiology		1664-042X	10.3389/fphys.2018.01889		Forced sustained swimming exercise at optimal speed enhances growth in many fish species, particularly through hypertrophy of the white skeletal muscle. The exact mechanism of this effect has not been resolved yet. To explore the role of cortisol, we first subjected wild-type zebrafish to an exercise protocol validated for exercise-enhanced growth, and showed that exercised zebrafish, which indeed showed enhanced growth, had higher cortisol levels than the non-exercised controls. A central role was therefore hypothesized for the steroid hormone cortisol acting through the Glucocorticoid receptor (Gr). Second, we subjected wild-type zebrafish and zebrafish with a mutant Gr to exercise at optimal, suboptimal, and super-optimal speeds and compared them with non-exercised controls. Exercised zebrafish showed growth enhancement at all speeds, with highest growth at optimal speeds. In the Gr mutant fish, exercise resulted in growth enhancement similar to wild-type zebrafish, indicating that cortisol signaling through Gr cannot be considered as a main determinant of exercise-enhanced growth. Finally, the transcriptome of white skeletal muscle tissue was analyzed by RNA sequencing. The results of this analysis showed that in the muscle tissue of Gr mutant fish a lower number of genes is regulated by exercise than in wild-type fish (183 vs. 351). A cluster of 36 genes was regulated by exercise in both wild-type and mutant fish, and in this cluster genes involved in transcriptional regulation and protein ubiquitination were overrepresented. Because these two processes appear to be regulated in both wild type and mutant fish, which both display exercise-enhanced growth, we suggest that they play an important role in the growth of muscles upon exercise.	2018	2024-03-06 19:59:24	2024-03-06T19:59:24Z		1889			9		Front Physiol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30692930 PMCID: PMC6339955					RNAseq; cortisol; glucocorticoid receptor; hypothalamic-pituitary-interrrenal (HPI) axis; swimming exercise physiology

Studied mostly for how mutant isoforms impact cancer, the normal roles for Tet enzymes during organogenesis are largely unknown. By analyzing compound mutant zebrafish, we discovered a requirement for Tet2/3 activity in the embryonic heart for recruitment of epicardial progenitors, associated with development of the atrial-ventricular canal (AVC). Through a combination of methylation, hydroxymethylation, and transcript profiling, the genes encoding the activin A subunit Inhbaa (in endocardium) and Sox9b (in myocardium) were implicated as demethylation targets of Tet2/3 and critical for organization of AVC-localized extracellular matrix (ECM), facilitating migration of epicardial progenitors onto the developing heart tube. This study elucidates essential DNA demethylation modifications that govern gene expression changes during cardiac development with striking temporal and lineage specificities, highlighting complex interactions in multiple cell populations during development of the vertebrate heart.	2019-01-15	2024-03-06 19:59:24	2024-03-06T19:59:24Z		720-732.e4		3	26		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30650362 PMCID: PMC6366638					Animals; Cell Movement; DNA demethylation; Dioxygenases; Extracellular Matrix; Heart; Organogenesis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; endocardium; genetics; heart development

Vitamin D Stimulates Cardiomyocyte Proliferation and Controls Organ Size and Regeneration in Zebrafish	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2019.01.001		Attaining proper organ size during development and regeneration hinges on the activity of mitogenic factors. Here, we performed a large-scale chemical screen in embryonic zebrafish to identify cardiomyocyte mitogens. Although commonly considered anti-proliferative, vitamin D analogs like alfacalcidol had rapid, potent mitogenic effects on embryonic and adult cardiomyocytes in vivo. Moreover, pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of vitamin D signaling controlled proliferation in multiple adult cell types and dictated growth rates in embryonic and juvenile zebrafish. Tissue-specific modulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling had organ-restricted effects, with cardiac VDR activation causing cardiomegaly. Alfacalcidol enhanced the regenerative response of injured zebrafish hearts, whereas VDR blockade inhibited regeneration. Alfacalcidol activated cardiac expression of genes associated with ErbB2 signaling, while ErbB2 inhibition blunted its effects on cell proliferation. Our findings identify vitamin D as mitogenic for cardiomyocytes and other cell types in zebrafish and indicate a mechanism to regulate organ size and regeneration.	2019-03-25	2024-03-06 19:59:24	2024-03-06T19:59:24Z		853-863.e5		6	48		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30713073 PMCID: PMC6435404					Animals; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; ErbB2 signaling; Heart; Mitogens; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organ Size; Organ Specificity; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Vitamin D; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiomyocyte; cell proliferation; chemical screen; heart; mitogen; regeneration; size control; vitamin D; zebrafish

However, we lack therapeutics to protect the insulin-producing β-cells from inflammatory damage. Closing this clinical gap requires the establishment of new disease models of islet inflammation to facilitate screening efforts aimed at identifying new protective agents. Here, we have developed a genetic model of Interleukin-1β (Il-1β)-driven islet inflammation in zebrafish, a vertebrate that allows for non-invasive imaging of β-cells and in vivo drug discovery. Live imaging of immune cells and β-cells in our model revealed dynamic migration, increased visitation and prolonged macrophage retention in the islet, together with robust activation of NF-κB signalling in β-cells. We find that Il-1β-mediated inflammation does not cause β-cell destruction but, rather, it impairs β-cell function and identity. In vivo, β-cells exhibit impaired glucose-stimulated calcium influx and reduced expression of genes involved in function and maturity. These defects are accompanied by α-cell expansion, glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia following a glucose challenge. Notably, we show that a medicinal plant derivative (wedelolactone) is capable of reducing the immune-cell infiltration while also ameliorating the hyperglycemic phenotype of our model. Importantly, these anti-diabetic properties in zebrafish are predictive of wedelolactone's efficacy in protecting rodent and human islets from cytokine-induced apoptosis. In summary, this new zebrafish model of diabetes opens a window to study the interactions between immune and β-cells in vivo, while also allowing the identification of therapeutic agents for protecting β-cells from inflammation.	2019-01-23	2024-03-06 19:59:24	2024-03-06T19:59:24Z		dmm036004		1	12		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30679186 PMCID: PMC6361155					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Beta-cells; Biological Products; Calcium; Coumarins; Cytokines; Diabetes; Disease Models, Animal; Down-Regulation; Glucose; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Inflammation; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Interleukin-1beta; Islet; Larva; Macrophages; Mice; Models, Genetic; Regeneration; Time-Lapse Imaging; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Moreover, global suppression of Notch activity following injury impairs cardiomyocyte proliferation and induces scarring. However, the lineage-specific requirements for Notch signaling and full array of downstream targets remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of endocardial Notch signaling following ventricular amputation compromises cardiomyocyte proliferation and stimulates fibrosis. RNA sequencing uncovered reduced levels of two transcripts encoding secreted Wnt antagonists, Wif1 and Notum1b, in Notch-suppressed hearts. Like Notch receptors, wif1 and notum1b are induced following injury in the endocardium and epicardium. Small-molecule-mediated activation of Wnt signaling is sufficient to impair cardiomyocyte proliferation and induce scarring. Last, Wnt pathway suppression partially restored cardiomyocyte proliferation in hearts experiencing endocardial Notch inhibition. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Notch signaling supports cardiomyocyte proliferation by dampening myocardial Wnt activity during zebrafish heart regeneration.	2019-01-15	2024-03-06 19:59:24	2024-03-06T19:59:24Z		546-554.e5		3	26		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30650349 PMCID: PMC6366857					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Heart; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Notch; Receptors, Notch; Wnt; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; cardiac repair; cardiomyocyte proliferation; heart regeneration; notum; wif; zebrafish

It is not clear how estrogen promotes hepatic growth. We investigated the effects of estrogen on hepatocyte proliferation during zebrafish development, liver regeneration, and carcinogenesis. We also studied human hepatocytes and liver tissues. METHODS: Zebrafish were exposed to selective modifiers of estrogen signaling at larval and adult stages. Liver growth was assessed by gene expression, fluorescent imaging, and histologic analyses. We monitored liver regeneration after hepatocyte ablation and HCC development after administration of chemical carcinogens (dimethylbenzanthrazene). Proliferation of human hepatocytes was measured in a coculture system. We measured levels of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) in HCC and nontumor liver tissues from 68 patients by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2) increased proliferation of hepatocytes and liver volume and mass in larval and adult zebrafish. Chemical genetic and epistasis experiments showed that GPER1 mediates the effects of E2 via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B-mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway: gper1-knockout and mtor-knockout zebrafish did not increase liver growth in response to E2. HCC samples from patients had increased levels of GPER1 compared with nontumor tissue samples; estrogen promoted proliferation of human primary hepatocytes. Estrogen accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis specifically in male zebrafish. Chemical inhibition or genetic loss of GPER1 significantly reduced tumor development in the zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of zebrafish and human liver cells and tissues, we found GPER1 to be a hepatic estrogen sensor that regulates liver growth during development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Inhibitors of GPER1 might be developed for liver cancer prevention or treatment.

We found that in zebrafish zfpm1-/- juvenile, cardiac function is significantly compromised, with hearts exhibiting deformed trabecular meshwork. To elucidate the mechanisms of Zfpm1 function in cardiac trabeculation, we analyzed zfpm1 mutant hearts more closely and found that loss of Zfpm1 activity resulted in over-activation of Neuregulin-ErbB signalling and abnormally elevated cardiomyocyte proliferation during cardiac trabeculae growth and modeling stages. These results implicate Zfpm1 plays a pivotal role in coordinating trabeculae patterning and growth.	2019-02-15	2024-03-06 19:59:23	2024-03-06T19:59:23Z		142-150		2	446		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30611731					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockout Techniques; Heart; Heart development; Microscopy, Confocal; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Neuregulin-ERBB signalling; Neuregulins; Receptor, ErbB-2; Signal Transduction; Ventricle trabeculation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zfpm1

The side population enriches for leukemia-propagating cell activity and Wnt pathway expression in zebrafish acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Haematologica		1592-8721	10.3324/haematol.2018.206417		Cancer stem cells have been strongly linked to resistance and relapse in many malignancies. However, purifying them from within the bulk tumor has been challenging, so their precise genetic and functional characteristics are not well defined. The side population assay exploits the ability of some cells to efflux Hoechst dye via ATP-binding cassette transporters. Stem cells have increased expression of these transporters and this assay has been shown to enrich for stem cells in various tissues and cancers. This study identifies the side population within a zebrafish model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and correlates the frequency of side population cells with the frequency of leukemia stem cells (more precisely referred to as leukemia-propagating cells within our transplantation model). In addition, the side population within the leukemia evolves with serial transplantation, increasing in tandem with leukemia-propagating cell frequency over subsequent generations. Sorted side population cells from these tumors are enriched for leukemia-propagating cells and have enhanced engraftment compared to sorted non-side population cells when transplanted into syngeneic recipients. RNA-sequencing analysis of sorted side population cells compared to non-side population cells identified a shared expression profile within the side population and pathway analysis yielded Wnt-signaling as the most overrepresented. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell differentiation and canonical Wnt-signaling were significantly upregulated in the side population. Overall, these results demonstrate that the side population in zebrafish acute lymphoblastic leukemia significantly enriches for leukemia-propagating cells and identifies the Wnt pathway as a likely genetic driver of leukemia stem cell fate.	2019-07	2024-03-06 19:59:23	2024-03-06T19:59:23Z		1388-1395		7	104		Haematologica								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30630989 PMCID: PMC6601080					Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Differentiation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Humans; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Side-Population Cells; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying follicle development, particularly apoptosis regulation in ovary, remain elusive. Here, we generated sox3 knockout zebrafish lines using CRISPR/Cas9. sox3 knockout led to follicle development retardation and a reduced fecundity in females. Comparative analysis of transcriptome between sox3-/- and wild-type ovaries revealed that Sox3 was involved in pathways of ovarian steroidogenesis and apoptosis. Knockout of sox3 promoted follicle apoptosis and obvious apoptosis signals were detected in somatic cells of stages III and IV follicles of sox3-/- ovaries. Moreover, Sox3 can bind to and activate the promoter of cyp19a1a. Up-regulation of Cyp19a1a expression promoted 17β-estradiol synthesis, which inhibited apoptosis in follicle development. Thus, Sox3 functions as a regulator of Cyp19a1a expression, via 17β-E2 linking apoptosis suppression, which is implicated in improving female fecundity.	2019-05	2024-03-06 19:59:22	2024-03-06T19:59:22Z		347-364		5	10		Protein Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30588557 PMCID: PMC6468042					Animals; Apoptosis; Aromatase; Cyp19a1a; Estradiol; Female; Fertility; Loss of Function Mutation; Ovarian Follicle; Ovary; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Sox3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; apoptosis; follicle development; zebrafish

Under this paradigm, we have implemented systematic sequencing of neonates and young children with a suspected genetic disorder. Here, we report on two families with recessive mutations in NCAPG2 and overlapping clinical phenotypes that include severe neurodevelopmental defects, failure to thrive, ocular abnormalities, and defects in urogenital and limb morphogenesis. NCAPG2 encodes a member of the condensin II complex, necessary for the condensation of chromosomes prior to cell division. Consistent with a causal role for NCAPG2, we found abnormal chromosome condensation, augmented anaphase chromatin-bridge formation, and micronuclei in daughter cells of proband skin fibroblasts. To test the functional relevance of the discovered variants, we generated an ncapg2 zebrafish model. Morphants displayed clinically relevant phenotypes, such as renal anomalies, microcephaly, and concomitant increases in apoptosis and altered mitotic progression. These could be rescued by wild-type but not mutant human NCAPG2 mRNA and were recapitulated in CRISPR-Cas9 F0 mutants. Finally, we noted that the individual with a complex urogenital defect also harbored a heterozygous NPHP1 deletion, a common contributor to nephronophthisis. To test whether sensitization at the NPHP1 locus might contribute to a more severe renal phenotype, we co-suppressed nphp1 and ncapg2, which resulted in significantly more dysplastic renal tubules in zebrafish larvae. Together, our data suggest that impaired function of NCAPG2 results in a severe condensinopathy, and they highlight the potential utility of examining candidate pathogenic lesions beyond the primary disease locus.	2019-01-03	2024-03-06 19:59:22	2024-03-06T19:59:22Z		94-111		1	104		Am J Hum Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30609410 PMCID: PMC6323578					Abnormalities, Multiple; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Cytoskeletal Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Membrane Proteins; Multiprotein Complexes; Mutation; NCAPD3; NCAPH2; NPHP1; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Pedigree; Phenotype; Syndrome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cell cycle delay; chromosome condensation; genetic interaction; microcephaly; micronuclei; renal cyst; zebrafish

In contrast, zebrafish have the capacity to fully regenerate their hearts after cardiac injury. Understanding and activating these mechanisms would improve health in patients suffering from long-term consequences of ischemia. Therefore, we monitored the dynamic transcriptome response of both mRNA and microRNA in zebrafish at 1⁻160 days post cryoinjury (dpi). Using a control model of sham-operated and healthy fish, we extracted the regeneration specific response and further delineated the spatio-temporal organization of regeneration processes such as cell cycle and heart function. In addition, we identified novel (miR-148/152, miR-218b and miR-19) and previously known microRNAs among the top regulators of heart regeneration by using theoretically predicted target sites and correlation of expression profiles from both mRNA and microRNA. In a cross-species effort, we validated our findings in the dynamic process of rat myoblasts differentiating into cardiomyocytes-like cells (H9c2 cell line). Concluding, we elucidated different phases of transcriptomic responses during zebrafish heart regeneration. Furthermore, microRNAs showed to be important regulators in cardiomyocyte proliferation over time.	2018-12-28	2024-03-06 19:59:22	2024-03-06T19:59:22Z		11		1	9		Biomolecules								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30597924 PMCID: PMC6359357					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cluster Analysis; Heart; MicroRNAs; Myocytes, Cardiac; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Messenger; Rats; Regeneration; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; cryoinjury; dynamic transcriptome; heart regeneration; miRNA; zebrafish

New neurons involved in repair are generated by a specific set of glial cells, known as ependymoglial cells. We analyze changes in the transcriptome of ependymoglial cells and their progeny after injury to infer the molecular pathways governing restorative neurogenesis. We identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a regulator of ependymoglia differentiation toward post-mitotic neurons. In vivo imaging shows that high AhR signaling promotes the direct conversion of a specific subset of ependymoglia into post-mitotic neurons, while low AhR signaling promotes ependymoglial proliferation. Interestingly, we observe the inactivation of AhR signaling shortly after injury followed by a return to the basal levels 7 days post injury. Interference with timely AhR regulation after injury leads to aberrant restorative neurogenesis. Taken together, we identify AhR signaling as a crucial regulator of restorative neurogenesis timing in the zebrafish brain.	2018-12-18	2024-03-06 19:59:21	2024-03-06T19:59:21Z		3241-3251.e5		12	25		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30566853					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Ependymoglial Cells; Mitosis; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Zebrafish; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; direct conversion; live imaging; neurogenesis; regeneration; zebrafish

It is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and has been detected at levels up to 167 nM in rivers in the United States. NP is an endocrine disruptor (ED) that can act as an agonist for estrogen receptors. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework defines an adverse outcome as the causal result of a series of molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) that lead to altered phenotypes. This study examined the liver transcriptome after a 21 day exposure to NP and 17β-estradiol (E2) by exploiting the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a systems toxicology model. The goal of this study was to tease out non-estrogenic genomic signatures associated with NP exposure using DNA microarray and RNA sequencing. Our experimental design included E2 as a positive and potent estrogenic control in order to effectively compare and contrast the 2 compounds. This approach allowed us to identify hepatic transcriptomic perturbations that could serve as MIEs for adverse health outcomes in response to NP. Our results revealed that exposure to NP was associated with differential expression (DE) of genes associated with the development of steatosis, disruption of metabolism, altered immune response, and metabolism of reactive oxygen species, further highlighting NP as a chemical of emerging concern (CEC).	2019-01-15	2024-03-06 19:59:21	2024-03-06T19:59:21Z		1-14			271		Gen Comp Endocrinol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30563618					17β-Estradiol; Aging; Animals; Fatty Acids; Humans; Insulin; Liver; Male; Microarray; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nonylphenol; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phenols; RNA sequencing; Surface-Active Agents; Systems Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Transgenerational hypocortisolism and behavioral disruption are induced by the antidepressant fluoxetine in male zebrafish Danio rerio	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1811695115		The global prevalence of depression is high during childbearing. Due to the associated risks to the mother and baby, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is often the first line of treatment. Given that FLX readily crosses the placenta, a fetus may be susceptible to the disruptive effects of FLX during this highly plastic stage of development. Here, we demonstrate that a 6-day FLX exposure to a fetus-relevant concentration at a critical developmental stage suppresses cortisol levels in the adult zebrafish (F0). This effect persists for three consecutive generations in the unexposed descendants (F1 to F3) without diminution and is more pronounced in males. We also show that the in vivo cortisol response of the interrenal (fish "adrenal") to an i.p. injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone was also reduced in the males from the F0 and F3 FLX lineages. Transcriptomic profiling of the whole kidney containing the interrenal cells revealed that early FLX exposure significantly modified numerous pathways closely associated with cortisol synthesis in the male adults from the F0 and F3 generations. We also show that the low cortisol levels are linked to significantly reduced exploratory behaviors in adult males from the F0 to F2 FLX lineages. This may be a cause for concern given the high prescription rates of FLX to pregnant women and the potential long-term negative impacts on humans exposed to these therapeutic drugs.	2018-12-26	2024-03-06 19:59:20	2024-03-06T19:59:20Z		E12435-E12442		52	115		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30530669 PMCID: PMC6310822					Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Behavior, Animal; Depressive Disorder; Family Characteristics; Female; Fluoxetine; Hydrocortisone; Male; Maternal Exposure; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Pregnancy; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Stress, Psychological; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; epigenetic; fluoxetine; stress; transgenerational; zebrafish

Loss of 5mC at these sequences is common in cancer and is a hallmark of Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome. While the general importance of 5mC is well-established, the specific functions of 5mC at pericentromeres are less clear. To address this deficiency, we generated a viable animal model of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of the ICF-gene ZBTB24. Deletion of zebrafish zbtb24 caused a progressive loss of 5mC at pericentromeres and ICF-like phenotypes. Hypomethylation of these repeats triggered derepression of pericentromeric transcripts and activation of an interferon-based innate immune response. Injection of pericentromeric RNA is sufficient to elicit this response in wild-type embryos, and mutation of the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA-sensing machinery blocks the response in mutants. These findings identify activation of the innate immune system as an early consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation, implicating derepression of pericentromeric transcripts as a trigger of autoimmunity.

A transcriptomics analysis of the Tbx5 paralogues in zebrafish	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0208766		TBX5 is essential for limb and heart development. Mutations in TBX5 are associated with Holt-Oram syndrome in humans. Due to the teleost specific genome duplication, zebrafish have two copies of TBX5: tbx5a and tbx5b. Both of these genes are expressed in regions of the lateral plate mesoderm and retina. In this study, we perform comparative RNA sequencing analysis on zebrafish embryos during the stages of lateral plate mesoderm migration. This work shows that knockdown of the Tbx5 paralogues results in altered gene expression in many tissues outside of the lateral plate mesoderm, especially in the somitic mesoderm and the intermediate mesoderm. Specifically, knockdown of tbx5b results in changes in somite size, in the differentiation of vasculature progenitors and in later patterning of trunk blood vessels.	2018	2024-03-06 19:59:20	2024-03-06T19:59:20Z		e0208766		12	13		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30532148 PMCID: PMC6287840					Animals; Computational Biology; Eye; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Heart; Myocardium; T-Box Domain Proteins; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here we sequence the genome of the Mediterranean amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) and characterize DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and transcriptomes across multiple developmental stages and adult tissues to investigate the evolution of the regulation of the chordate genome. Comparisons with vertebrates identify an intermediate stage in the evolution of differentially methylated enhancers, and a high conservation of gene expression and its cis-regulatory logic between amphioxus and vertebrates that occurs maximally at an earlier mid-embryonic phylotypic period. We analyse regulatory evolution after whole-genome duplications, and find that-in vertebrates-over 80% of broadly expressed gene families with multiple paralogues derived from whole-genome duplications have members that restricted their ancestral expression, and underwent specialization rather than subfunctionalization. Counter-intuitively, paralogues that restricted their expression increased the complexity of their regulatory landscapes. These data pave the way for a better understanding of the regulatory principles that underlie key vertebrate innovations.	2018-12	2024-03-06 19:59:19	2024-03-06T19:59:19Z		64-70		7734	564		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30464347 PMCID: PMC6292497					Animals; Body Patterning; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression Regulation; Genomics; Humans; Lancelets; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcriptome; Vertebrates

In humans, inherited genetic mutations that lead to progressive mitochondrial pathology often manifest during infancy and can lead to death, reflecting the indispensable nature of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Here, we describe a zebrafish mutant for the gene mia40a (chchd4a), the life-essential homologue of the evolutionarily conserved Mia40 oxidoreductase which drives the biogenesis of cysteine-rich mitochondrial proteins. We report that mia40a mutant animals undergo progressive cellular respiration defects and develop enlarged mitochondria in skeletal muscles before their ultimate death at the larval stage. We generated a deep transcriptomic and proteomic resource that allowed us to identify abnormalities in the development and physiology of endodermal organs, in particular the liver and pancreas. We identify the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas to be severely affected by mutations in the MIA pathway. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular, cellular and organismal effects of mitochondrial deficiency, important for the accurate diagnosis and future treatment strategies of mitochondrial diseases.	2018-11	2024-03-06 19:59:18	2024-03-06T19:59:18Z		e1007743		11	14		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30457989 PMCID: PMC6245507

Machine learning based classification of cells into chronological stages using single-cell transcriptomics	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-018-35218-5		Age-associated deterioration of cellular physiology leads to pathological conditions. The ability to detect premature aging could provide a window for preventive therapies against age-related diseases. However, the techniques for determining cellular age are limited, as they rely on a limited set of histological markers and lack predictive power. Here, we implement GERAS (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell), a machine learning based framework capable of assigning individual cells to chronological stages based on their transcriptomes. GERAS displays greater than 90% accuracy in classifying the chronological stage of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells. The framework demonstrates robustness against biological and technical noise, as evaluated by its performance on independent samplings of single-cells. Additionally, GERAS determines the impact of differences in calorie intake and BMI on the aging of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells, respectively. We further harness the classification ability of GERAS to identify molecular factors that are potentially associated with the aging of beta-cells. We show that one of these factors, junba, is necessary to maintain the proliferative state of juvenile beta-cells. Our results showcase the applicability of a machine learning framework to classify the chronological stage of heterogeneous cell populations, while enabling detection of candidate genes associated with aging.	2018-11-21	2024-03-06 19:59:18	2024-03-06T19:59:18Z		17156		1	8		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30464314 PMCID: PMC6249247					Age Factors; Animals; Cytological Techniques; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Machine Learning; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish

BBB formation and modulation are not only important for development, but also relevant for vascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is little understanding of how Wnt signaling contributes to brain angiogenesis and BBB formation. Here we show, using high resolution in vivo imaging and temporal and spatial manipulation of Wnt signaling, different requirements for Wnt signaling during brain angiogenesis and BBB formation. In the absence of Wnt signaling, premature Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1pr) signaling reduces VE-cadherin and Esama at cell-cell junctions. We suggest that Wnt signaling suppresses S1pr signaling during angiogenesis to enable the dynamic junction formation during anastomosis, whereas later S1pr signaling regulates BBB maturation and VE-cadherin stabilization. Our data provides a link between brain angiogenesis and BBB formation and identifies Wnt signaling as coordinator of the timing and as regulator of anastomosis.	2018-11-19	2024-03-06 19:59:18	2024-03-06T19:59:18Z		4860		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30451830 PMCID: PMC6242933					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antigens, CD; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Cadherins; Capillaries; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Reporter; Luminescent Proteins; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Receptors, Lysosphingolipid; Red Fluorescent Protein; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; beta Catenin

Why neurohypophyseal capillaries become permeable while the neighboring vasculature of the brain forms BBB remains unclear. We show that pituicytes, the resident astroglial cells of the neurohypophysis, express genes that are associated with BBB breakdown during neuroinflammation. Pituicyte-enriched factors provide a local microenvironment that instructs a permeable neurovascular conduit. Thus, genetic and pharmacological perturbations of Vegfa and Tgfβ3 affected HNS vascular morphogenesis and permeability and impaired the expression of the fenestral marker plvap. The anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone decreased HNS permeability and downregulated the pituicyte-specific cyp26b gene, encoding a retinoic acid catabolic enzyme. Inhibition of Cyp26b activity led to upregulation of tight junction protein Claudin-5 and decreased permeability. We conclude that pituicyte-derived factors regulate the "decision" of endothelial cells to adopt a permeable endothelial fate instead of forming a BBB.	2018-12-17	2024-03-06 19:59:17	2024-03-06T19:59:17Z		711-726.e5		6	47		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30449506					Animals; Astrocytes; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Claudin; Claudin-5; Cues; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Vascular; Neuroglia; Permeability; Pituitary Gland; Pituitary Gland, Posterior; Tight Junctions; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; arginine-vasopressin; astroglia; blood-brain barrier; fenestrae; microglia; neuroendocrine; neurovascular unit; oxytocin; pituicyte; plvap; tight junction; vascular permeability; zebrafish

However, how the parental epigenomes transit to the zygotic epigenome in early development remains elusive. Here we show that parental-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish involves extensive erasure of parental epigenetic memory, starting with methylating gametic enhancers. Surprisingly, this occurs even prior to fertilization for sperm. Both parental enhancers lose histone marks by the 4-cell stage, and zygotic enhancers are not activated until around zygotic genome activation (ZGA). By contrast, many promoters remain hypomethylated and, unexpectedly, acquire histone acetylation before ZGA at as early as the 4-cell stage. They then resolve into either activated or repressed promoters upon ZGA. Maternal depletion of histone acetyltransferases results in aberrant ZGA and early embryonic lethality. Finally, such reprogramming is largely driven by maternal factors, with zygotic products mainly contributing to embryonic enhancer activation. These data reveal widespread enhancer dememorization and promoter priming during parental-to-zygotic transition.	2018-11-15	2024-03-06 19:59:17	2024-03-06T19:59:17Z		673-686.e6		4	72		Mol Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30444999					Acetylation; Animals; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genome; Histone Code; Histones; Male; Oocytes; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Spermatozoa; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote; early embryo development; epigenetic memory removal; epigenetic reprogramming; histone modifications; parental-to-zygotic transition; zebrafish epigenome

The Lysosomal Transcription Factor TFEB Represses Myelination Downstream of the Rag-Ragulator Complex	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2018.10.003		Myelin allows for fast and efficient axonal conduction, but much remains to be determined about the mechanisms that regulate myelin formation. To investigate the genetic basis of myelination, we carried out a genetic screen using zebrafish. Here, we show that the lysosomal G protein RagA is essential for CNS myelination. In rraga-/- mutant oligodendrocytes, target genes of the lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb are upregulated, consistent with previous evidence that RagA represses Tfeb activity. Loss of Tfeb function is sufficient to restore myelination in RagA mutants, indicating that hyperactive Tfeb represses myelination. Conversely, tfeb-/- single mutants exhibit ectopic myelin, further indicating that Tfeb represses myelination during development. In a mouse model of de- and remyelination, TFEB expression is increased in oligodendrocytes, but the protein is localized to the cytoplasm, and hence inactive, especially during remyelination. These results define essential regulators of myelination and may advance approaches to therapeutic remyelination.	2018-11-05	2024-03-06 19:59:16	2024-03-06T19:59:16Z		319-330.e5		3	47		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30399334 PMCID: PMC6250074					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Endosomes; Homeodomain Proteins; Intracellular Membranes; Lysosomes; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated; Oligodendroglia; RagA; Signal Transduction; TFEB; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; glia; lysosomes; myelin; myelination; oligodendrocytes; zebrafish

In order to maintain energy balance, induction or repression of metabolic pathways must be regulated and act in concert with the energetic demands of the cell at a given point in time. A new class of small noncoding RNAs, the microRNAs (miRNAs), has added yet further complexity to the control of metabolic homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: Understanding the damages induced by toxins in the liver and the intestine as well as the interplay between the miRNome and transcriptome first requires baseline characterization in these tissues in healthy animals under cellular homeostasis. METHODS: The liver (main site for detoxification) and the gut (primary exposure routes for contaminant exposure) were dissected out (wildtype fish), total and small RNA extracted, mRNA and miRNA libraries constructed and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Differential Expression (DE) analysis was performed comparing liver with gut and an "miRNA matrix" that integrates the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data was constructed. RESULTS: Both the miRNome and transcriptome of the liver and gut tissues were characterized and putative novel miRNAs were identified. Exploration of the "miRNA matrix" regulatory network revealed that miRNAs uniquely expressed in the liver or gut tissue regulated fundamental cellular processes important for both organs, and that commonly expressed miRNAs in both tissues regulated biological processes that were specific to either the liver or the gut. CONCLUSION: The result of our analyses revealed new insights into microRNA function in these tissues.	2018-11	2024-03-06 19:59:16	2024-03-06T19:59:16Z		615-629		7	19		Curr Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30386173 PMCID: PMC6194436					Bioinformatics; Homeostasis; MicroRNAs; Non-coding RNAs; Systems level analysis; Zebrafish; mRNAs

Long non-coding RNAs have age-dependent diurnal expression that coincides with age-related changes in genome-wide facultative heterochromatin	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-018-5170-3		BACKGROUND: Disrupted diurnal rhythms cause accelerated aging and an increased incidence in age-related disease and morbidity. The circadian clock governs cell physiology and metabolism by controlling transcription and chromatin. The goal of this study is to further understand the mechanism of age-related changes to circadian chromatin with a focus on facultative heterochromatin and diurnal non-coding RNAs. RESULTS: We performed a combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq at two diurnal time-points for three different age groups to examine the connection between age-related changes to circadian transcription and heterochromatin in neuronal tissue. Our analysis focused on uncovering the relationships between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and age-related changes to histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3), in part because the Period (Per) complex can direct facultative heterochromatin and models of aging suggest age-related changes to heterochromatin and DNA methylation. Our results reveal that lncRNAs and circadian output change dramatically with age, but the core clock genes remain rhythmic. Age-related changes in clock-controlled gene (ccg) expression indicate there are age-dependent circadian output that change from anabolic to catabolic processes during aging. In addition, there are diurnal and age-related changes in H3K9me3 that coincide with changes in transcription. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a model where some age-related changes in diurnal expression are partially attributed to age-related alterations to rhythmic facultative heterochromatin. The changes in heterochromatin are potentially mediated by changes in diurnal lncRNA creating an interlocked circadian-chromatin regulatory network that undergoes age-dependent metamorphosis.	2018-10-29	2024-03-06 19:59:16	2024-03-06T19:59:16Z		777		1	19		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30373515 PMCID: PMC6206985					Aging; Animals; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Circadian rhythm; Diurnal; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heterochromatin; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation; Long non-coding RNA; RNA, Long Noncoding; Zebrafish

Signaling Events Downstream of AHR Activation That Contribute to Toxic Responses: The Functional Role of an AHR-Dependent Long Noncoding RNA (slincR) Using the Zebrafish Model	Environmental Health Perspectives		1552-9924	10.1289/EHP3281		BACKGROUND: A structurally diverse group of chemicals, including dioxins [e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)] and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), can xenobiotically activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and contribute to adverse health effects in humans and wildlife. In the zebrafish model, repression of sox9b has a causal role in several AHR-mediated toxic responses, including craniofacial cartilage malformations; however, the mechanism of sox9b repression remains unknown. We previously identified a long noncoding RNA, sox9b long intergenic noncoding RNA (slincR), which is increased (in an AHR-dependent manner) by multiple AHR ligands and is required for the AHR-activated repression of sox9b. OBJECTIVE: Using the zebrafish model, we aimed to enhance our understanding of the signaling events downstream of AHR activation that contribute to toxic responses by identifying: a) whether slincR is enriched on the sox9b locus, b) slincR's functional contributions to TCDD-induced toxicity, c) PAHs that increase slincR expression, and d) mammalian orthologs of slincR. METHODS: We used capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets (CHART), qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, morphometric analysis of cartilage structures, and hemorrhaging screens. RESULTS: The slincR transcript was enriched at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the sox9b locus. Transcriptome profiling and human ortholog analyses identified processes related to skeletal and cartilage development unique to TCDD-exposed controls, and angiogenesis and vasculature development unique to TCDD-exposed zebrafish that were injected with a splice-blocking morpholino targeting slincR. In comparison to TCDD exposed control morphants, slincR morphants exposed to TCDD resulted in abnormal cartilage structures and a smaller percentage of animals displaying the hemorrhaging phenotype. In addition, slincR expression was significantly increased in six out of the sixteen PAHs we screened. CONCLUSION: Our study establishes that in zebrafish, slincR is recruited to the sox9b 5' UTR to repress transcription, can regulate cartilage development, has a causal role in the TCDD-induced hemorrhaging phenotype, and is up-regulated by multiple environmentally relevant PAHs. These findings have important implications for understanding the ligand-specific mechanisms of AHR-mediated toxicity. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3281.	2018-11	2024-03-06 19:59:16	2024-03-06T19:59:16Z		117002		11	126		Environ Health Perspect	Signaling Events Downstream of AHR Activation That Contribute to Toxic Responses							eng					PubMed		PMID: 30398377 PMCID: PMC6371766					Animals; Cartilage; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Humans; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; RNA, Long Noncoding; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; SOX9 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

To understand the mechanisms underlying follicle activation and therefore puberty onset, we undertook this transcriptomic study to investigate gene expression profiles in the event. Our analysis revealed a total of 2,027 up-regulated and 859 down-regulated genes during the PG-PV transition. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that in addition to basic cellular functions such as gene transcription, cell differentiation, and cell migration, other biological processes such as steroidogenesis, cell signaling and angiogenesis were also enriched in up-regulated genes; by comparison, some processes were down-regulated including piRNA metabolism, gene silencing and proteolysis. Further Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified a variety of signaling pathways that might play pivotal roles in PG-PV transition, including MAPK, TGF-β, Hedgehog, FoxO, VEGF, Jak-STAT, and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. Other pathways of particular interest included endocytosis and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. We also analyzed expression changes of genes expressed in different compartments viz. oocytes and follicle cells. Interestingly, most oocyte-specific genes remained unchanged in expression during follicle activation whereas a great number of genes specifically expressed in the follicle cells showed significant changes in expression. Overall, this study reported a comprehensive analysis for genes, biological processes and pathways involved in follicle activation, which also marks female puberty onset in the zebrafish when occurring for the first time in sexual maturation.	2018	2024-03-06 19:59:15	2024-03-06T19:59:15Z		593			9		Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30364302 PMCID: PMC6193065					RNA-seq; follicles; folliculogenesis; puberty; transcriptomics; zebrafish

Yap is required for scar formation but not myocyte proliferation during heart regeneration in zebrafish	Cardiovascular Research		1755-3245	10.1093/cvr/cvy243		AIMS: The Hippo signalling pathway regulates multiple cellular processes during organ development and maintenance by modulating activity of the transcriptional cofactor Yap. Core components of this pathway are required for neonatal mouse heart regeneration, however, investigations to date have typically focused on expression and activity in cardiomyocytes. Due to the regenerative capacity of zebrafish and the fact that global loss of Yap is not fully embryonic lethal in zebrafish, we leveraged a yap null mutant to investigate the impact of constitutive Yap deletion during zebrafish heart regeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following cryoinjury in adult hearts, myocyte proliferation was not decreased in yap mutants, contrary to expectations based on mouse data. Experiments in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) revealed that deletion of either Yap or Taz had a modest effect on heart growth, reducing gross organ size, while their combined deletion was synergistic; thus, Yap and Taz share some overlapping roles in zebrafish heart development. Surprisingly, adult yap mutants exhibited decreased collagen composition at 7 days post-injury, suggesting a critical role for Yap in scar formation during heart regeneration. siRNA-mediated Yap knockdown in primary rat (Rattus norvegicus) cardiac cells revealed a fibroblast-specific role for Yap in controlling the expression of cytoskeletal and myofibroblast activation genes, as well as pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines. Corroborating these RNAseq data, we observed increased macrophage infiltration in the scars of yap mutants at 7 days post-injury. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Yap deletion has minimal effect on myocyte proliferation in adults, but significantly influences scar formation and immune cell infiltration during zebrafish heart regeneration. Collectively, these data suggest an unexpected role for Yap in matrix formation and macrophage recruitment during heart regeneration.	2019-03-01	2024-03-06 19:59:15	2024-03-06T19:59:15Z		570-577		3	115		Cardiovasc Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30295714					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Cicatrix; Cold Temperature; Disease Models, Animal; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart Injuries; Macrophages; Myocardial regeneration; Myocytes, Cardiac; Rats; Regeneration; Remodelling; Signal Transduction; Trans-Activators; Ventricular Remodeling; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Physiological Responses to Swimming-Induced Exercise in the Adult Zebrafish Regenerating Heart	Frontiers in Physiology		1664-042X	10.3389/fphys.2018.01362		Exercise promotes a set of physiological responses known to provide long-term health benefits and it can play an important role in cardioprotection. In the present study, we examined cardiac responses to exercise training in the adult zebrafish and in the context of cardiac regeneration. We found that swimming-induced exercise increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and that this response was also found under regenerating conditions, when exercise was performed either prior to and after ventricular cryoinjury (CI). Exercise prior to CI resulted in a mild improvement in cardiac function and lesion recovery over the non-exercise condition. Transcriptomic profiling of regenerating ventricles in cryoinjured fish subjected to exercise identified genes possibly involved in the cardioprotective effects of exercise and that could represent potential targets for heart regeneration strategies. Taken together, our results suggest that exercise constitutes a physiological stimulus that may help promote cardiomyogenic mechanisms of the vertebrate heart through the induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation. The zebrafish exercise model may be useful for investigating the potential cardioprotective effects of exercise in teleost fish and to contribute to further identify and develop novel avenues in basic research to promote heart regeneration.	2018	2024-03-06 19:59:15	2024-03-06T19:59:15Z		1362			9		Front Physiol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30327615 PMCID: PMC6174316					cardiomyocyte; exercise; heart; proliferation; regeneration; swimming; zebrafish

Critical Role for a Subset of Intestinal Macrophages in Shaping Gut Microbiota in Adult Zebrafish	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.025		The gut microbiota is strongly influenced by environmental factors, although host contribution is far less understood. We leveraged macrophage-deficient interferon regulatory factor irf8 zebrafish mutants to investigate the role of macrophages in this process. In conventionally raised adult irf8-deficient mutants, we found a significant loss of intestinal macrophages associated with a strikingly altered gut microbiota when compared to co-housed siblings. The destabilization of the gut commensal microbiota was associated with a severe reduction in complement C1q genes and outgrowth of a rare bacterial species. Consistent with a critical function of irf8 in adult intestinal macrophages, irf8 is abundantly expressed in these cells normally, and restoring macrophage irf8 expression in irf8 mutants was sufficient to recover commensal microbes and C1q genes expression. This study reports an important subpopulation of intestinal macrophages that requires irf8 to establish in the gut, ensure normal colonization of gut microbes, and prevent immune dysregulation.	2018-10-09	2024-03-06 19:59:15	2024-03-06T19:59:15Z		424-436		2	25		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30304682 PMCID: PMC6245655					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Cells, Cultured; Complement C1q; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Interferon Regulatory Factors; Macrophages; Mutation; Zebrafish; c1q; complement; interferon regulatory factor; intestinal macrophages; irf8; microbiota; microglia; zebrafish

Intestinal microbiome adjusts the innate immune setpoint during colonization through negative regulation of MyD88	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-018-06658-4		Host pathways mediating changes in immune states elicited by intestinal microbial colonization are incompletely characterized. Here we describe alterations of the host immune state induced by colonization of germ-free zebrafish larvae with an intestinal microbial community or single bacterial species. We show that microbiota-induced changes in intestinal leukocyte subsets and whole-body host gene expression are dependent on the innate immune adaptor gene myd88. Similar patterns of gene expression are elicited by colonization with conventional microbiome, as well as mono-colonization with two different zebrafish commensal bacterial strains. By studying loss-of-function myd88 mutants, we find that colonization suppresses Myd88 at the mRNA level. Tlr2 is essential for microbiota-induced effects on myd88 transcription and intestinal immune cell composition.	2018-10-05	2024-03-06 19:59:15	2024-03-06T19:59:15Z		4099		1	9		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30291253 PMCID: PMC6173721					Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genes, Reporter; Immunity, Innate; Intestinal Mucosa; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Hdacs are well characterized in various systems for their physiological and epigenetic relevance. However, their significance during retina regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that inhibition of Hdac1 causes a decline in regenerative ability, and injury-dependent regulation of hdacs is essential for regulating regeneration-associated genes like ascl1a, lin28a, and repressors like her4.1 at the injury site. We show selective seclusion of Hdac1 from the proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) and its upregulation in the neighboring cells. Hdacs negatively regulate her4.1, which also represses lin28a and essential cytokines to control MGPCs proliferation. Interestingly, Hdacs' inhibition reversibly blocks regeneration through the repression of critical cytokines and other regeneration-specific genes, which is also revealed by whole-retina RNA sequence analysis. Our study shows mechanistic understanding of the Hdac pathway during zebrafish retina regeneration.	2018-09-28	2024-03-06 19:59:14	2024-03-06T19:59:14Z		68-84			7		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30267687 PMCID: PMC6135741					Model Organism; Molecular Mechanism of Gene Regulation; Molecular Neuroscience; Transcriptomics

The affected pathways underlying the pathophysiology of co-morbidities due to glucocorticoid deficiency remain poorly understood and require further investigation. METHODS: To explore the pathophysiological processes related to glucocorticoid deficiency, we have performed global transcriptional, post-transcriptional and metabolic profiling of a cortisol-deficient zebrafish mutant with a disrupted ferredoxin (fdx1b) system. FINDINGS: fdx1b−/− mutants show pervasive reprogramming of metabolism, in particular of glutamine-dependent pathways such as glutathione metabolism, and exhibit changes of oxidative stress markers. The glucocorticoid-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of key enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis was also affected in this mutant. Moreover, fdx1b−/− mutants exhibit crucial features of primary adrenal insufficiency, and mirror metabolic changes detected in primary adrenal insufficiency patients. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides a detailed map of metabolic changes induced by glucocorticoid deficiency as a consequence of a disrupted ferredoxin system in an animal model of adrenal insufficiency. This improved pathophysiological understanding of global glucocorticoid deficiency informs on more targeted translational studies in humans suffering from conditions associated with glucocorticoid deficiency.

We present here a study of its effects on the zebrafish eleutheroembryo transcriptome at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 4 mg L-1, this latter representing the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) found in our study at three different macroscopical endpoints (survival, hatching and swim bladder inflation). Multivariate data analysis methods identified both monotonic and bi-phasic patterns of dose-dependent responses. Functional analyses of genes affected by BPA exposure suggest an interaction of BPA with different signaling pathways, being the estrogenic and retinoid receptors two likely targets. In addition, we identified an apparently unrelated inhibitory effect on, among others, visual function genes. We interpret our data as the result of a sum of underlying, independent molecular mechanisms occurring simultaneously at the exposed animals, well below the macroscopic LOEC, but related to at least some of the observed morphological alterations, particularly in eye size and yolk sac resorption. Our data supports the idea that the physiological effects of BPA cannot be only explained by its rather weak interaction with the estrogen receptor, and that multivariate analyses are required to analyze the effects of toxicants like BPA, which interact with different cellular targets producing complex phenotypes.	2018-12	2024-03-06 19:59:14	2024-03-06T19:59:14Z		988-997		Pt B	243		Environ Pollut								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30248606					ANOVA-PLS; Animals; BPA; Benzhydryl Compounds; Differentially expressed genes (DEGs); Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Endocrine Disruptors; Estrone; Hazardous Substances; Hormone-response; Multivariate Analysis; Obesogens; Phenols; RNA-Seq; Receptors, Estrogen; Toxicity Tests; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Here, we generated tp53 deleted zebrafish that spontaneously develop malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors, angiosarcomas, germ cell tumors, and an aggressive Natural Killer cell-like leukemia for which no animal model has been developed. Because the tp53 deletion was generated in syngeneic zebrafish, engraftment of fluorescent-labeled tumors could be dynamically visualized over time. Importantly, engrafted tumors shared gene expression signatures with predicted cells of origin in human tissue. Finally, we showed that tp53del/del enhanced invasion and metastasis in kRASG12D-induced embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), but did not alter the overall frequency of cancer stem cells, suggesting novel pro-metastatic roles for TP53 loss-of-function in human muscle tumors. In summary, we have developed a Li-Fraumeni zebrafish model that is amenable to large-scale transplantation and direct visualization of tumor growth in live animals.	2018-09-07	2024-03-06 19:59:13	2024-03-06T19:59:13Z		e37202			7		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30192230 PMCID: PMC6128690					Animals; Cell Count; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hemangiosarcoma; Homozygote; Leukemia; MPNST; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal; Survival Analysis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; angiosarcoma; cancer biology; germ cell tumor; leukemia; metastasis; rhabdomyosarcoma; zebrafish

Studies in cultured cells have ascribed a role for HRG1/SLC48A1 in heme-iron transport but the in vivo function of this heme transporter is unclear. Here we present genetic evidence in a zebrafish model that Hrg1 is essential for macrophage-mediated heme-iron recycling during erythrophagocytosis in the kidney. Furthermore, we show that zebrafish Hrg1a and its paralog Hrg1b are functional heme transporters, and genetic ablation of both transporters in double knockout (DKO) animals shows lower iron accumulation concomitant with higher amounts of heme sequestered in kidney macrophages. RNA-seq analyses of DKO kidney revealed large-scale perturbation in genes related to heme, iron metabolism and immune functions. Taken together, our results establish the kidney as the major organ for erythrophagocytosis and identify Hrg1 as an important regulator of heme-iron recycling by macrophages in the adult zebrafish.	2018-09	2024-03-06 19:59:13	2024-03-06T19:59:13Z		e1007665		9	14		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30248094 PMCID: PMC6171960					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cytophagocytosis; Erythrocytes; Female; Gene Knockout Techniques; Head Kidney; Hematopoiesis; Heme; Hemeproteins; Iron; Macrophages; Male; Models, Animal; Solute Carrier Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Perfluorobutanesulfonic Acid Disrupts Pancreatic Organogenesis and Regulation of Lipid Metabolism in the Zebrafish, Danio rerio	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfy237		Following the phase-out of highly persistent perfluorosulfonates in the United States from non-stick and stain-resistant products in the early 2000s, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) has replaced these compounds as a primary surfactant. Measurements of PFBS in environmental and human samples have been rising in recent years, raising concerns about potential negative health effects. We previously found that embryonic exposures to a related compound, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), decreased pancreas length and insulin-producing islet area in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). The objective of this study was to compare the effects of PFBS exposures on pancreatic organogenesis with our previous PFOS findings. Dechorionated zebrafish embryos from two different transgenic fish lines (Tg[insulin:GFP], Tg[ptf1a:GFP]) were exposed to 0 (0.01% DMSO), 16, or 32 µM PFBS daily beginning at 1 day post fertilization (dpf) until 4 and 7 dpf when they were examined using fluorescent microscopy for islet area and morphology, and exocrine pancreas length. PFBS-exposed embryos had significantly increased caudal fin deformities, delayed swim bladder inflation, and impaired yolk utilization. Incidence of fish with significantly stunted growth and truncated exocrine pancreas length was significantly increased, although these two effects occurred independently. Islet morphology revealed an increased incidence of severely hypomorphic islets (areas lower than the 1st percentile of controls) and an elevated occurrence of fragmented islets. RNA-Seq data (4 dpf) also identify disruptions in regulation of lipid homeostasis. Overall, this work demonstrates that PFBS exposure can perturb embryonic development, energy homeostasis, and pancreatic organogenesis.	2019-01-01	2024-03-06 19:59:13	2024-03-06T19:59:13Z		258-268		1	167		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30239974 PMCID: PMC6317420					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression; Lipid Metabolism; Organogenesis; Pancreas; Sulfonic Acids; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
RQGRTCTE	journalArticle	2018	Sun, Jiawei; Yan, Lu; Shen, Weimin; Meng, Anming	Maternal Ybx1 safeguards zebrafish oocyte maturation and maternal-to-zygotic transition by repressing global translation	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.166587		Maternal mRNAs and proteins dictate early embryonic development before zygotic genome activation. In the absence of transcription, elaborate control of maternal mRNA translation is of particular importance for oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. By analyzing zebrafish ybx1 mutants with a null allele, we demonstrate an essential role of maternal ybx1 in repressing global translation in oocytes and embryos. Loss of maternal Ybx1 leads to impaired oocyte maturation and egg activation. Maternal ybx1 (Mybx1) mutant embryos fail to undergo normal cleavage and the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Morpholino knockdown of ybx1 also results in MZT loss and epiboly failure, suggesting the postfertilization requirement of Ybx1. In addition, elevated global translation level and the unfolded protein response were found in Ybx1-depleted embryos. Supplementing translational repression by eIF4E inhibition markedly rescues the Mybx1 phenotype. Mechanistically, Ybx1 in embryos may associate with processing body components and repress translation when tethered to target mRNAs. Collectively, our results identify maternal Ybx1 as a global translational repressor required for oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis.	2018-10-02	2024-03-06 19:59:12	2024-03-06T19:59:12Z		dev166587		19	145		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30135188					Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryogenesis; Female; Fertilization; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Pleiotropy; Maternal-to-zygotic transition; Models, Biological; Mutation; Oocyte maturation; Oocytes; Phenotype; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Translational repression; Unfolded Protein Response; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1; Ybx1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

While the nephrotoxicity and teratogenicity of OTA have been extensively documented, the molecular mechanisms associated with OTA toxicity remained poorly understood in a developing organism. We showed that zebrafish embryos exposed to OTA demonstrated incorrect heart looping and small heart chambers. OTA also impaired the renal morphology and reduced the glomerular filtration rate of the embryonic zebrafish. The treatment of embryos with OTA attenuated the expression of the prolactin receptor, a gene (PRLRa) that has a key role in organogenesis and osmoregulation in vertebrates. OTA not only inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT5 and AKT, but also down-regulated the level of serpina1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the microRNA profiling based on RNA sequencing revealed the up-regulation of microRNA-731 (miR-731) in the OTA-treated embryos. Further in silico analysis predicted that PRLRa was a target gene of miR-731. AntagomiR-731 restored PRLRa levels that had been reduced by OTA and also recovered the pronephros morphology that was damaged by OTA. These observations suggest that the exposure to OTA adversely affected the organogenesis of zebrafish, and the modulation of miR-731 and the PRLR signaling cascade contributed to the abnormal renal development mediated by OTA.	2016-03-01	2024-03-06 19:59:12	2024-03-06T19:59:12Z		519-529		2	5		Toxicol Res (Camb)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30090366 PMCID: PMC6062247

Tdrd6a Regulates the Aggregation of Buc into Functional Subcellular Compartments that Drive Germ Cell Specification	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2018.07.009		Phase separation represents an important form of subcellular compartmentalization. However, relatively little is known about how the formation or disassembly of such compartments is regulated. In zebrafish, the Balbiani body (Bb) and the germ plasm (Gp) are intimately linked phase-separated structures essential for germ cell specification and home to many germ cell-specific mRNAs and proteins. Throughout development, these structures occur as a single large aggregate (Bb), which disperses throughout oogenesis and upon fertilization accumulates again into relatively large assemblies (Gp). Formation of the Bb requires Bucky ball (Buc), a protein with prion-like properties. We found that the multi-tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd6a interacts with Buc, affecting its mobility and aggregation properties. Importantly, lack of this regulatory interaction leads to significant defects in germ cell development. Our work presents insights into how prion-like protein aggregations can be regulated and highlights the biological relevance of such regulatory events.	2018-08-06	2024-03-06 19:59:12	2024-03-06T19:59:12Z		285-301.e9		3	46		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30086300 PMCID: PMC6084408					Animals; Balbiani body; Bucky ball; Cytoplasm; Germ Cells; Oocytes; Oogenesis; Organelles; RNA, Messenger; Tdrd6; Tudor domain; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; arginine methylation; germ plasm; phase separation; primordial germ cell; prion-like domain; zebrafish

Failed Progenitor Specification Underlies the Cardiopharyngeal Phenotypes in a Zebrafish Model of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2018.06.117		Microdeletions involving TBX1 result in variable congenital malformations known collectively as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Tbx1-deficient mice and zebrafish recapitulate several disease phenotypes, including pharyngeal arch artery (PAA), head muscle (HM), and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) deficiencies. In zebrafish, these structures arise from nkx2.5+ progenitors in pharyngeal arches 2-6. Because pharyngeal arch morphogenesis is compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, the malformations were considered secondary. Here, we report that the PAA, HM, and OFT phenotypes in tbx1 mutant zebrafish are primary and arise prior to pharyngeal arch morphogenesis from failed specification of the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage. Through in situ analysis and lineage tracing, we reveal that nkx2.5 and tbx1 are co-expressed in this progenitor population. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that gdf3-ALK4 signaling is a downstream mediator of nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage specification. Collectively, these studies support a cellular mechanism potentially underlying the cardiovascular and craniofacial defects observed in the 22q11.2DS population.	2018-07-31	2024-03-06 19:59:11	2024-03-06T19:59:11Z		1342-1354.e5		5	24		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30067987 PMCID: PMC6261257					22q11; 22q11 Deletion Syndrome; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; DiGeorge; Embryonic Stem Cells; Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5; Pharynx; Phenotype; T-Box Domain Proteins; Tbx1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; arch artery; cardiopharyngeal; heart; nkx2.5; progenitor; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
3HK5J53S	journalArticle	2018	Nudelman, German; Frasca, Antonio; Kent, Brandon; Sadler, Kirsten C.; Sealfon, Stuart C.; Walsh, Martin J.; Zaslavsky, Elena	High resolution annotation of zebrafish transcriptome using long-read sequencing	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.223586.117		With the emergence of zebrafish as an important model organism, a concerted effort has been made to study its transcriptome. This effort is limited, however, by gaps in zebrafish annotation, which are especially pronounced concerning transcripts dynamically expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). To date, short-read sequencing has been the principal technology for zebrafish transcriptome annotation. In part because these sequence reads are too short for assembly methods to resolve the full complexity of the transcriptome, the current annotation is rudimentary. By providing direct observation of full-length transcripts, recently refined long-read sequencing platforms can dramatically improve annotation coverage and accuracy. Here, we leveraged the SMRT platform to study the transcriptome of zebrafish embryos before and after ZGA. Our analysis revealed additional novelty and complexity in the zebrafish transcriptome, identifying 2539 high-confidence novel transcripts that originated from previously unannotated loci and 1835 high-confidence new isoforms in previously annotated genes. We validated these findings using a suite of computational approaches including structural prediction, sequence homology, and functional conservation analyses, as well as by confirmatory transcript quantification with short-read sequencing data. Our analyses provided insight into new homologs and paralogs of functionally important proteins and noncoding RNAs, isoform switching occurrences, and different classes of novel splicing events. Several novel isoforms representing distinct splicing events were validated through PCR experiments, including the discovery and validation of a novel 8-kb transcript spanning multiple mir-430 elements, an important driver of early development. Our study provides a significantly improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation resource.	2018-09	2024-03-06 19:59:11	2024-03-06T19:59:11Z		1415-1425		9	28		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30061115 PMCID: PMC6120630					Animals; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Transcriptome; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
IFVD54PA	journalArticle	2018	Wu, Xiaotong; Shen, Weimin; Zhang, Bingjie; Meng, Anming	The genetic program of oocytes can be modified in vivo in the zebrafish ovary	Journal of Molecular Cell Biology		1759-4685	10.1093/jmcb/mjy044		Oocytes, the irreplaceable gametes for generating a new organism, are matured in the ovary of living female animals. It is unknown whether any genetic manipulations can be applied to immature oocytes inside the living ovaries. As a proof-of-concept, we here demonstrate genetic amendments of zebrafish immature oocytes within the ovary. Oocyte microinjection in situ (OMIS) stimulates tissue repair responses, but some of the microinjected immature oocytes are matured, ovulated and fertilizable. By OMIS-mediated Cas9 approach, ntla and gata5 loci of oocytes arrested at prophase I of meiosis are successfully edited before fertilization. Through OMIS, high efficiency of biallelic mutations in single or multiple loci using Cas9/gRNAs allows immediate manifestation of mutant phenotypes in F0 embryos and multiple transgenes can co-express the reporters in F0 embryos with patterns similar to germline transgenic embryos. Furthermore, maternal knockdown of dnmt1 by antisense morpholino via OMIS results in a dramatic decrease of global DNA methylation level at the dome stage and causes embryonic lethality prior to segmentation period. Therefore, OMIS opens a door to efficiently modify the genome and provides a possibility to repair genetically abnormal oocytes in situ.	2018-12-01	2024-03-06 19:59:11	2024-03-06T19:59:11Z		479-493		6	10		J Mol Cell Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30060229					Animals; CRISPR-Associated Protein 9; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Female; Fertilization; GATA5 Transcription Factor; Gene Editing; Genetic Loci; Male; Meiotic Prophase I; Microinjections; Oocytes; Ovary; RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems; RNA, Messenger; Transgenes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Taking advantage of the zebrafish caudal fin model, we performed a global unbiased time-course transcriptomic analysis of fin regeneration. Biostatistics analyses identified extracellular matrix (ECM) as the most enriched gene sets. Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized ECM structures that provide tissues with structural cohesion and serve as a major extracellular signaling platform. While the embryonic formation of BM has been extensively investigated, its regeneration in adults remains poorly studied. We therefore focused on BM gene expression kinetics and showed that it recapitulates many aspects of development. As such, the re-expression of the embryonic col14a1a gene indicated that col14a1a is part of the regeneration-specific program. We showed that laminins and col14a1a genes display similar kinetics and that the corresponding proteins are spatially and temporally controlled during regeneration. Analysis of our CRISPR/Cas9-mediated col14a1a knockout fish showed that collagen XIV-A contributes to timely deposition of laminins. As changes in ECM organization can affect tissue mechanical properties, we analyzed the biomechanics of col14a1a-/- regenerative BM using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our data revealed a thinner BM accompanied by a substantial increase of the stiffness when compared to controls. Further AFM 3D-reconstructions showed that BM is organized as a checkerboard made of alternation of soft and rigid regions that is compromised in mutants leading to a more compact structure. We conclude that collagen XIV-A transiently acts as a molecular spacer responsible for BM structure and biomechanics possibly by helping laminins integration within regenerative BM.	2019-01	2024-03-06 19:59:10	2024-03-06T19:59:10Z		82-101			75-76		Matrix Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30031067					Animal Fins; Animals; Basement Membrane; Basement membrane; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Collagen; Collagen XIV; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Extracellular matrix; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Kinetics; Regeneration; Transcriptome; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

However, isolated BA is also associated with minor extrahepatic gut and cardiovascular anomalies and multiple susceptibility genes, suggesting common origins. METHODS: We investigated novel susceptibility genes with genome-wide association, targeted sequencing and tissue staining in BA requiring liver transplantation, independent of BA subtype. Candidate gene effects on morphogenesis, developmental pathways, and ciliogenesis, which regulates left-right patterning were investigated with zebrafish knockdown and mouse knockout models, mouse airway cell cultures, and liver transcriptome analysis. RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Mannosidase-1-α-2 (MAN1A2) were significantly associated with BA and with other polymorphisms known to affect MAN1A2 expression but were not differentially enriched in either BA subtype. In zebrafish embryos, man1a2 knockdown caused poor biliary network formation, ciliary dysgenesis in Kupffer's vesicle, cardiac and liver heterotaxy, and dysregulated egfra and other developmental genes. Suboptimal man1a2 knockdown synergized with suboptimal EGFR signaling or suboptimal knockdown of the EGFR pathway gene, adenosine-ribosylation-factor-6, which had minimal effects individually, to reproduce biliary defects but not heterotaxy. In cultured mouse airway epithelium, Man1a2 knockdown arrested ciliary development and motility. Man1a2 -/- mice, which experience respiratory failure, also demonstrated portal and bile ductular inflammation. Human BA liver and Man1a2 -/- liver exhibited reduced Man1a2 expression and dysregulated ciliary genes, known to cause multisystem human laterality defects. CONCLUSION: BA requiring transplantation associates with sequence variants in MAN1A2. man1a2 regulates laterality, in addition to hepatobiliary morphogenesis, by regulating ciliogenesis in zebrafish and mice, providing a novel developmental basis for multisystem defects in BA.	2020	2024-03-06 20:04:45	2024-03-06T20:04:45Z		538701			11		Front Physiol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33192543 PMCID: PMC7662016					biliary atresia; biliary morphogenesis; cilia; laterality; liver transplantation

In zebrafish, a BMP signaling gradient patterns the dorsal-ventral axis. We systematically identified target genes responding to BMP and found that they have diverse spatiotemporal expression patterns. Transcriptional responses to optogenetically delivered high- and low-amplitude BMP signaling pulses indicate that spatiotemporal expression is not fully defined by different BMP signaling activation thresholds. Additionally, we observed negligible correlations between spatiotemporal expression and transcription kinetics for the majority of analyzed genes in response to BMP signaling pulses. In contrast, spatial differences between BMP target genes largely collapsed when FGF and Nodal signaling were inhibited. Our results suggest that, similar to other patterning systems, combinatorial signaling is likely to be a major driver of spatial diversity in BMP-dependent gene expression in zebrafish.	2020-11-11	2024-03-06 20:04:44	2024-03-06T20:04:44Z		e58641			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33174840 PMCID: PMC7728441					Animals; BMP signaling; Body Patterning; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Kinetics; Nodal Protein; Optogenetics; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cell biology; combinatorial signaling; developmental biology; embryogenesis; morphogen gradient; optogenetics; patterning; zebrafish

Transcriptome profiling can provide insights into the dynamic changes in global gene expression profiles induced by chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal. Male and female zebrafish were continually exposed to 0.5% ethanol for a period of 9 weeks. Upon completion of alcohol treatment, the fish were subjected to a withdrawal program for 9 weeks. Brain and liver tissues of control, alcohol exposed and withdrawal fish were isolated and the extracted RNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000. The resultant paired end reads were mapped to the zebrafish reference genome (danRer10). The mapped transcripts were quantified for their expression and subjected to differential expression analysis across the three conditions. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the differentially regulated genes was carried out to identify affected biological processes. The data for this project is available as a GEO dataset under Accession number GSE143416. The gene expression data discussed here accompanies the research article entitled 'Tissue-specific transcriptome recovery on withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure in zebrafish'.	2020-12	2024-03-06 20:04:44	2024-03-06T20:04:44Z		106442			33		Data Brief								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33163595 PMCID: PMC7607250					Alcohol; Brain; Liver; Recovery; Transcriptome; Withdrawal; Zebrafish

The scarcity of oligodendrocytes in the lesion site impairs re-myelination of spared fibres, which leaves axons denuded, impedes signal transduction and contributes to permanent functional deficits. In contrast to mammals, zebrafish can functionally regenerate the spinal cord. Yet, little is known about oligodendroglial lineage biology and re-myelination capacity after SCI in a regeneration-permissive context. Here, we report that, in adult zebrafish, SCI results in axonal, oligodendrocyte and myelin sheath loss. We find that OPCs, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, survive the injury, enter a reactive state, proliferate and differentiate into oligodendrocytes. Concomitantly, the oligodendrocyte population is re-established to pre-injury levels within 2 weeks. Transcriptional profiling revealed that reactive OPCs upregulate the expression of several myelination-related genes. Interestingly, global reduction of axonal tracts and partial re-myelination, relative to pre-injury levels, persist at later stages of regeneration, yet are sufficient for functional recovery. Taken together, these findings imply that, in the zebrafish spinal cord, OPCs replace lost oligodendrocytes and, thus, re-establish myelination during regeneration.	2020-12-16	2024-03-06 20:04:44	2024-03-06T20:04:44Z		dev193946		24	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33158923					(Re-)myelination; Animals; CNS injury; CNS regeneration; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells; Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; Oligodendroglia; Regeneration; Remyelination; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal cord; Zebrafish

Arsenic induced redox imbalance triggers the unfolded protein response in the liver of zebrafish	Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology		1096-0333	10.1016/j.taap.2020.115307		Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is one of the most endemic toxicants worldwide and oxidative stress is a key cellular pathway underlying iAs toxicity. Other cellular stress response pathways, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are also impacted by iAs exposure, however it is not known how these pathways intersect to cause disease. We optimized the use of zebrafish larvae to identify the relationship between these cellular stress response pathways and arsenic toxicity. We found that the window of iAs susceptibility during zebrafish development corresponds with the development of the liver, and that even a 24-h exposure can cause lethality if administered to mature larvae, but not to early embryos. Acute exposure of larvae to iAs generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), an antioxidant response, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and UPR activation in the liver. An in vivo assay using transgenic larvae expressing a GFP-tagged secreted glycoprotein in hepatocytes (Tg(fabp10a:Gc-EGFP)) revealed acute iAs exposure selectively decreased expression of Gc-EGFP, indicating that iAs impairs secretory protein folding in the liver. The transcriptional output of UPR activation is preceded by ROS production and activation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. These studies implicate redox imbalance as the mechanism of iAs-induced ER stress and suggest that crosstalk between these pathways underlie iAs-induced hepatic toxicity.	2020-12-15	2024-03-06 20:04:43	2024-03-06T20:04:43Z		115307			409		Toxicol Appl Pharmacol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33147493 PMCID: PMC7725916					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antioxidants; Arsenic; ER stress; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Hepatocytes; Larva; Liver; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Unfolded Protein Response; Unfolded protein response; Zebrafish

So far, thyrocytes have been assumed to be a homogenous population. To uncover heterogeneity in the thyrocyte population and molecularly characterize the non-thyrocyte cells surrounding the follicle, we developed a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the region containing the zebrafish thyroid gland. The 6249-cell atlas includes profiles of thyrocytes, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, immune cells, and fibroblasts. Further, the thyrocytes show expression heterogeneity, including bimodal expression of the transcription factor pax2a. To validate thyrocyte heterogeneity, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-based pax2a knock-in line that monitors pax2a expression in the thyrocytes. A population of pax2a-low mature thyrocytes interspersed in individual follicles can be distinguished. We corroborate heterogeneity within the thyrocyte population using RNA sequencing of pax2a-high and pax2a-low thyrocytes, which demonstrates 20% differential expression in transcriptome between the two subpopulations. Our results identify and validate transcriptional differences within the presumed homogenous thyrocyte population.	2020-12-03	2024-03-06 20:04:43	2024-03-06T20:04:43Z		e50612		12	21		EMBO Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33140917 PMCID: PMC7726803					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9; Gene Expression Profiling; Thyroid Epithelial Cells; Thyroid Gland; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; heterogeneity; single-cell; thyroid gland; zebrafish

Developmental Neurotoxicity of the Harmful Algal Bloom Toxin Domoic Acid: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Altered Behavior in the Zebrafish Model	Environmental Health Perspectives		1552-9924	10.1289/EHP6652		BACKGROUND: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce potent neurotoxins that threaten human health, but current regulations may not be protective of sensitive populations. Early life exposure to low levels of the HAB toxin domoic acid (DomA) produces long-lasting behavioral deficits in rodent and primate models; however, the mechanisms involved are unknown. The zebrafish is a powerful in vivo vertebrate model system for exploring cellular processes during development and thus may help to elucidate mechanisms of DomA developmental neurotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: We used the zebrafish model to investigate how low doses of DomA affect the developing nervous system, including windows of susceptibility to DomA exposure, structural and molecular changes in the nervous system, and the link to behavioral alterations. METHODS: To identify potential windows of susceptibility, DomA (0.09-0.18 ng) was delivered to zebrafish through caudal vein microinjection during distinct periods in early neurodevelopment. Following exposure, structural and molecular targets were identified using live imaging of transgenic fish and RNA sequencing. To assess the functional consequences of exposures, we quantified startle behavior in response to acoustic/vibrational stimuli. RESULTS: Larvae exposed to DomA at 2 d postfertilization (dpf), but not at 1 or 4 dpf, showed consistent deficits in startle behavior at 7 dpf, including lower responsiveness and altered kinematics. Similarly, myelination in the spinal cord was disorganized after exposure at 2 dpf but not 1 or 4 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed disruption of the initial stages of myelination. DomA exposure at 2 dpf down-regulated genes required for maintaining myelin structure and the axonal cytoskeleton. DISCUSSION: These results in zebrafish reveal a developmental window of susceptibility to DomA-induced behavioral deficits and identify altered gene expression and disrupted myelin structure as possible mechanisms. The results establish a zebrafish model for investigating the mechanisms of developmental DomA toxicity, including effects with potential relevance to exposed sensitive human populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6652.	2020-11	2024-03-06 20:04:43	2024-03-06T20:04:43Z		117002		11	128		Environ Health Perspect	Developmental Neurotoxicity of the Harmful Algal Bloom Toxin Domoic Acid							eng					PubMed		PMID: 33147070 PMCID: PMC7641300					Animals; Behavior, Animal; Harmful Algal Bloom; Kainic Acid; Nervous System; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

However, there have not been many comprehensive studies of the effect of individual duox isoforms on central-axon regeneration in vivo. Here, we explored this question in zebrafish, an excellent model organism for central-axon regeneration studies. In our research, mutation of the duox gene with CRISPR/Cas9 significantly retarded the single-axon regeneration of the zebrafish Mauthner cell in vivo. Using deep transcriptome sequencing, we found that the expression levels of related functional enzymes in mitochondria were down-regulated in duox mutant fish. In vivo imaging showed that duox mutants had significantly disrupted mitochondrial transport and redox state in single Mauthner-cell axon. Our research data provide insights into how duox is involved in central-axon regeneration by changing mitochondrial transport.	2020-12	2024-03-06 20:04:42	2024-03-06T20:04:42Z		1500-1512		12	36		Neurosci Bull								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33123984 PMCID: PMC7719141					Animals; Axon regeneration; Axons; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Dual Oxidases; Mauthner cell; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial dynamics; Nerve Regeneration; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; duox

Gage	Lineage analysis reveals an endodermal contribution to the vertebrate pituitary	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aba4767		Vertebrate sensory organs arise from epithelial thickenings called placodes. Along with neural crest cells, cranial placodes are considered ectodermal novelties that drove evolution of the vertebrate head. The anterior-most placode generates the endocrine lobe [adenohypophysis (ADH)] of the pituitary, a master gland controlling growth, metabolism, and reproduction. In addition to known ectodermal contributions, we use lineage tracing and time-lapse imaging in zebrafish to identify an endodermal contribution to the ADH. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the adult pituitary reveals similar competency of endodermal and ectodermal epithelia to generate all endocrine cell types. Further, endoderm can generate a rudimentary ADH-like structure in the near absence of ectodermal contributions. The fish condition supports the vertebrate pituitary arising through interactions of an ancestral endoderm-derived proto-pituitary with newly evolved placodal ectoderm.	2020-10-23	2024-03-06 20:04:42	2024-03-06T20:04:42Z		463-467		6515	370		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33093109 PMCID: PMC8021009					Animals; Cell Lineage; Endoderm; Pituitary Gland, Anterior; RNA-Seq; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish

Despite this widespread and conserved activity, Setd2 and H3K36me3 are dispensable for normal growth of yeast but are absolutely required for mammalian embryogenesis, such as oocyte maturation and embryonic vasculogenesis in mice, raising a question of how the functional requirements of Setd2 in specific developmental stages have emerged through evolution. Here, we explored this issue by studying the essentiality and function of Setd2 in zebrafish. Surprisingly, the setd2-null zebrafish are viable and fertile. They show Mendelian birth ratio and normal embryogenesis without vascular defect as seen in mice; however, they have a small body size phenotype attributed to insufficient energy metabolism and protein synthesis, which is reversable in a nutrition-dependent manner. Unlike the sterile Setd2-null mice, the setd2-null zebrafish can produce functional sperms and oocytes. Nonetheless, related to the requirement of maternal Setd2 for oocyte maturation in mice, the second generation of setd2-null zebrafish that carry no maternal setd2 show decreased survival rate and a developmental delay at maternal-to-zygotic transition. Taken together, these results indicate that, while the phenotypes of the setd2-null zebrafish and mice are apparently different, they are matched in parallel as the underlying mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved. Thus, the differential requirements of Setd2 may reflect distinct viability thresholds that associate with intrinsic and/or extrinsic stresses experienced by the organism through development, and these epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may serve as a reserved source supporting the evolution of life from simplicity to complexity.	2020	2024-03-06 20:04:42	2024-03-06T20:04:42Z		72			6		Cell Discov	setd2 knockout zebrafish is viable and fertile							eng					PubMed		PMID: 33088589 PMCID: PMC7573620					Developmental biology; Epigenetics

Developmental modules comprise discrete units specified by self-sufficient genetic programs that can interact with each other during embryogenesis. Here, we have taken advantage of the different span of embryonic development between two distantly related teleosts, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) (3 and 9 days, respectively), to explore modularity principles. We report that inter-species blastula transplantations result in the ectopic formation of a retina formed by donor cells - a module. We show that the time taken for the retina to develop follows a genetic program: an ectopic zebrafish retina in medaka develops with zebrafish dynamics. Heterologous transplantation results in a temporal decoupling between the donor retina and host organism, illustrated by two paradigms that require retina-host interactions: lens recruitment and retino-tectal projections. Our results uncover a new experimental system for addressing temporal decoupling along embryonic development, and highlight the presence of largely autonomous but interconnected developmental modules that orchestrate organogenesis.	2020-11-23	2024-03-06 20:04:41	2024-03-06T20:04:41Z		dev192500		22	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33033120					Animals; Blastula; Developmental timing; Genetic chimera; Heterografts; Inter-species transplantation; Lens induction; Medaka; Organogenesis; Oryzias; Retina; Retino-tectal projection; Transplantation Chimera; Zebrafish

Emergence of Neuronal Diversity during Vertebrate Brain Development	Neuron		1097-4199	10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.023		Neurogenesis comprises many highly regulated processes including proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. However, the transcriptional landscapes underlying brain development are poorly characterized. We describe a developmental single-cell catalog of ∼220,000 zebrafish brain cells encompassing 12 stages from embryo to larva. We characterize known and novel gene markers for ∼800 clusters and provide an overview of the diversification of neurons and progenitors across these time points. We also introduce an optimized GESTALT lineage recorder that enables higher expression and recovery of Cas9-edited barcodes to query lineage segregation. Cell type characterization indicates that most embryonic neural progenitor states are transitory and transcriptionally distinct from neural progenitors of post-embryonic stages. Reconstruction of cell specification trajectories reveals that late-stage retinal neural progenitors transcriptionally overlap cell states observed in the embryo. The zebrafish brain development atlas provides a resource to define and manipulate specific subsets of neurons and to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying vertebrate neurogenesis.	2020-12-23	2024-03-06 20:04:41	2024-03-06T20:04:41Z		1058-1074.e6		6	108		Neuron								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33068532 PMCID: PMC8286448					Animals; Brain; CRISPR-Cas9 barcoding; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Zebrafish; brain; cell specification; lineage; neurogenesis; progenitor; retina; scRNA-Seq; transcriptional cascade; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
NHZZWZC3	journalArticle	2021	Aluru, Neelakanteswar; Karchner, Sibel I.	PCB126 Exposure Revealed Alterations in m6A RNA Modifications in Transcripts Associated With AHR Activation	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfaa158		Chemical modifications of proteins, DNA, and RNA moieties play critical roles in regulating gene expression. Emerging evidence suggests the RNA modifications (epitranscriptomics) have substantive roles in basic biological processes. One of the most common modifications in mRNA and noncoding RNAs is N6-methyladenosine (m6A). In a subset of mRNAs, m6A sites are preferentially enriched near stop codons, in 3' UTRs, and within exons, suggesting an important role in the regulation of mRNA processing and function including alternative splicing and gene expression. Very little is known about the effect of environmental chemical exposure on m6A modifications. As many of the commonly occurring environmental contaminants alter gene expression profiles and have detrimental effects on physiological processes, it is important to understand the effects of exposure on this important layer of gene regulation. Hence, the objective of this study was to characterize the acute effects of developmental exposure to PCB126, an environmentally relevant dioxin-like PCB, on m6A methylation patterns. We exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 for 6 h starting from 72 h post fertilization and profiled m6A RNA using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeRIP-seq). Our analysis revealed 117 and 217 m6A peaks in the DMSO and PCB126 samples (false discovery rate 5%), respectively. The majority of the peaks were preferentially located around the 3' UTR and stop codons. Statistical analysis revealed 15 m6A marked transcripts to be differentially methylated by PCB126 exposure. These include transcripts that are known to be activated by AHR agonists (eg, ahrra, tiparp, nfe2l2b) as well as others that are important for normal development (vgf, cebpd, sned1). These results suggest that environmental chemicals such as dioxin-like PCBs could affect developmental gene expression patterns by altering m6A levels. Further studies are necessary to understand the functional consequences of exposure-associated alterations in m6A levels.	2021-01-06	2024-03-06 20:04:41	2024-03-06T20:04:41Z		84-94		1	179		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33064826 PMCID: PMC8453794					Animals; MeRIP; Methylation; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; development; dioxin-like PCBs; epitranscriptomics; m6A; zebrafish

An adhesion code ensures robust pattern formation during tissue morphogenesis	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aba6637		Animal development entails the organization of specific cell types in space and time, and spatial patterns must form in a robust manner. In the zebrafish spinal cord, neural progenitors form stereotypic patterns despite noisy morphogen signaling and large-scale cellular rearrangements during morphogenesis and growth. By directly measuring adhesion forces and preferences for three types of endogenous neural progenitors, we provide evidence for the differential adhesion model in which differences in intercellular adhesion mediate cell sorting. Cell type-specific combinatorial expression of different classes of cadherins (N-cadherin, cadherin 11, and protocadherin 19) results in homotypic preference ex vivo and patterning robustness in vivo. Furthermore, the differential adhesion code is regulated by the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient. We propose that robust patterning during tissue morphogenesis results from interplay between adhesion-based self-organization and morphogen-directed patterning.	2020-10-02	2024-03-06 20:04:40	2024-03-06T20:04:40Z		113-116		6512	370		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33004519 PMCID: PMC7879479					Animals; Body Patterning; Cadherins; Cell Adhesion; Neural Stem Cells; Protocadherins; Spinal Cord; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Defects in OFT development can lead to severe malformations, including aortic aneurysms, which are frequently associated with impaired TGF-β signaling. To better understand the role of TGF-β signaling in OFT formation, we generated zebrafish lacking the TGF-β receptor Alk5 and found a strikingly specific dilation of the OFT: alk5-/- OFTs exhibit increased EC numbers as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and SMC disorganization. Surprisingly, endothelial-specific alk5 overexpression in alk5-/- rescues the EC, ECM, and SMC defects. Transcriptomic analyses reveal downregulation of the ECM gene fibulin-5, which when overexpressed in ECs ameliorates OFT morphology and function. These findings reveal a new requirement for endothelial TGF-β signaling in OFT morphogenesis and suggest an important role for the endothelium in the etiology of aortic malformations.	2020-09-29	2024-03-06 20:04:40	2024-03-06T20:04:40Z		e57603			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32990594 PMCID: PMC7524555					Animals; Aorta; Endothelium; Endothelium, Vascular; Heart Ventricles; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I; Smad3 Protein; TGF-β; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cellular cross-talk; developmental biology; extracellular matrix; outflow tract; smooth muscle cells; zebrafish

This heterogeneity is further exemplified by the recent discovery of ectoderm-derived immune cells-metaphocytes in zebrafish epidermis. Yet, whether non-hematopoiesis-derived immune cells generally exist in barrier tissues remains obscured. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an endoderm-derived immune cell population in the gill and intestine of zebrafish. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the endoderm-derived immune cells are myeloid-like cells with high similarities to the ectoderm-derived metaphocytes in epidermis. Like metaphocytes in epidermis, the endoderm-derived immune cells are non-phagocytic but professional in external soluble antigen uptake. Depletion of the endoderm-derived immune cells in gill hinder the local immune response to external soluble stimulants. This study demonstrates a general existence of non-hematopoiesis-derived immune cells in zebrafish mucosal barriers and challenges the prevalent view that resident immune cells in mucosal barriers arise exclusively from hematopoiesis.	2020-10-06	2024-03-06 20:04:40	2024-03-06T20:04:40Z		108227		1	33		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33027664					Animals; Endoderm; Gills; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; endoderm; gill; intestine; macrophage; metaphocyte; zebrafish

Here, we characterized its function in the zebrafish and revealed an unexpected role of this pathway in vertebrate embryonic development. We showed that knockdown of mondoa impaired the early morphogenetic movement of epiboly in zebrafish embryos and caused microtubule defects. Expression of genes in the terpenoid backbone and sterol biosynthesis pathways upstream of pregnenolone synthesis was coordinately downregulated in these embryos, including the most downregulated gene nsdhl. Loss of Nsdhl function likewise impaired epiboly, similar to MondoA loss of function. Both epiboly and microtubule defects were partially restored by pregnenolone treatment. Maternal-zygotic mutants of mondoa showed perturbed epiboly with low penetrance and compensatory changes in the expression of terpenoid/sterol/steroid metabolism genes. Collectively, our results show a novel role for MondoA in the regulation of early vertebrate development, connecting glucose, cholesterol and steroid hormone metabolism with early embryonic cell movements.	2020-09-24	2024-03-06 20:04:39	2024-03-06T20:04:39Z		e57068			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32969791 PMCID: PMC7515633					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Cholesterol; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; carbohydrate response element; cholesterol; developmental biology; epiboly; genetics; genomics; metabolism; microtubule; pregnenolone; zebrafish

Here, we report that mutations in gridlock (grl; also known as hey2), encoding a Hairy-related basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor, enhance CM proliferation and reduce fibrosis following damage. In contrast, myocardial grl induction blunts CM dedifferentiation and regenerative responses to heart injury. RNA sequencing analyses uncover Smyd2 lysine methyltransferase (KMT) as a key transcriptional target repressed by Grl. Reduction in Grl protein levels triggered by injury induces smyd2 expression at the wound myocardium, enhancing CM proliferation. We show that Smyd2 functions as a methyltransferase and modulates the Stat3 methylation and phosphorylation activity. Inhibition of the KMT activity of Smyd2 reduces phosphorylated Stat3 at cardiac wounds, suppressing the elevated CM proliferation in injured grl mutant hearts. Our findings establish an injury-specific transcriptional repression program in governing CM renewal during heart regeneration, providing a potential strategy whereby silencing Grl repression at local regions might empower regeneration capacity to the injured mammalian heart.	2020-09-28	2024-03-06 20:04:39	2024-03-06T20:04:39Z		dev190678		18	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32988975 PMCID: PMC7541343					Animals; Animals, Newborn; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cardiomyocyte proliferation; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Grl; Heart; Heart regeneration; Hey2; Lysine; Lysine methyltransferase; Methyltransferases; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Phosphorylation; Regeneration; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Vertebrates; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In zebrafish, knockout of the main MG detoxifying system Glyoxalase 1, led to limited MG elevation but significantly elevated aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) activity and aldh3a1 expression, suggesting the compensatory role of Aldh3a1 in diabetes. To evaluate the function of Aldh3a1 in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, aldh3a1-/- zebrafish mutants were generated using CRISPR-Cas9. Vasculature and pancreas morphology were analysed by zebrafish transgenic reporter lines. Corresponding reactive carbonyl species (RCS), glucose, transcriptome and metabolomics screenings were performed and ALDH activity was measured for further verification. Aldh3a1-/- zebrafish larvae displayed retinal vasodilatory alterations, impaired glucose homeostasis, which can be aggravated via pdx1 silencing induced hyperglycaemia. Unexpectedly, MG was not altered, but 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), another prominent lipid peroxidation RCS exhibited high affinity with Aldh3a1, was increased in aldh3a1 mutants. 4-HNE was responsible for the retinal phenotype via pancreas disruption induced hyperglycaemia and can be rescued via l-Carnosine treatment. Furthermore, in type 2 diabetic patients, serum 4-HNE was increased and correlated with disease progression. Thus, our data suggest impaired 4-HNE detoxification and elevated 4-HNE concentration as biomarkers but also the possible inducers for diabetes, from genetic susceptibility to the pathological progression.	2020-10	2024-03-06 20:04:39	2024-03-06T20:04:39Z		101723			37		Redox Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32980661 PMCID: PMC7519378					4-hydroxynonenal; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Aldehydes; Aldh3a1; Animals; Diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus; Gene Knockout Techniques; Glucose homeostasis; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Reactive carbonyl species; Zebrafish

RAB13 mRNA compartmentalisation spatially orients tissue morphogenesis	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.15252/embj.2020106003		Polarised targeting of diverse mRNAs to cellular protrusions is a hallmark of cell migration. Although a widespread phenomenon, definitive functions for endogenous targeted mRNAs and their relevance to modulation of in vivo tissue dynamics remain elusive. Here, using single-molecule analysis, gene editing and zebrafish live-cell imaging, we report that mRNA polarisation acts as a molecular compass that orients motile cell polarity and spatially directs tissue movement. Clustering of protrusion-derived RNAseq datasets defined a core 192-nt localisation element underpinning precise mRNA targeting to sites of filopodia formation. Such targeting of the small GTPase RAB13 generated tight spatial coupling of mRNA localisation, translation and protein activity, achieving precise subcellular compartmentalisation of RAB13 protein function to create a polarised domain of filopodia extension. Consequently, genomic excision of this localisation element and perturbation of RAB13 mRNA targeting-but not translation-depolarised filopodia dynamics in motile endothelial cells and induced mispatterning of blood vessels in zebrafish. Hence, mRNA polarisation, not expression, is the primary determinant of the site of RAB13 action, preventing ectopic functionality at inappropriate subcellular loci and orienting tissue morphogenesis.	2020-11-02	2024-03-06 20:04:38	2024-03-06T20:04:38Z		e106003		21	39		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32946121 PMCID: PMC7604621					Animals; Cell Movement; Cell Polarity; Endothelial Cells; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Gene Editing; Morphogenesis; Pseudopodia; RNA, Messenger; Zebrafish; angiogenesis; endothelial cell; filopodia; mRNA targeting; rab GTP-Binding Proteins; zebrafish

The molecular and cellular mechanisms of cell migration during gastrulation though well researched lacks an understanding of the contribution of cell sizes to collective cell migration. This is especially important during the early phase of metazoan development, which is dominated by constantly changing cell sizes in the background of which cells migrate en mass to shape the embryo. Here we investigate this phenomenon in zebrafish embryos, a model system in which early cell divisions causes cell sizes to decrease naturally over time as cells migrate collectively to sculpt the embryonic body plan. Because mutations that can perturb cell sizes so early in development do not exist, we generate haploid and tetraploid zebrafish embryos and show that cell sizes in such embryos are smaller and larger than the diploid norm, respectively. Cells in embryos made of smaller or larger than normal cells migrate sub-optimally, leading to gastrulation defects. Gene expression analysis suggests that the observed defects originate from altered cell size, and not from pleiotropic effects of altered ploidy. This interpretation is strengthened when gastrulation defects are rescued by increasing cell sizes in embryos wherein cell sizes are smaller than normal. We show that the migration defects are cell-autonomous by live imaging migrating haploid and tetraploid cells during gastrulation in chimeric diploid embryos. Analysis of membrane protrusion dynamics in single cells shows that cells normally extend protrusions non-uniformly during migration, a phenomenon which is perturbed when cell sizes deviate from the norm. Thus, an optimal range of developmental stage-specific cell sizes appears necessary for collective cell migration to correctly position cells in space and time to shape an amorphous ball of blastoderm into an embryo.	2020-12-01	2024-03-06 20:04:38	2024-03-06T20:04:38Z		26-40		1-2	468		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32937161					Animals; Blastoderm; Cell Size; Cell migration; Cell size; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mutation; Zebrafish

Previously, we observed that an environmentally realistic mixture of these compounds affects energy balance, growth, and reproduction in exposed zebrafish (F0), and behavior in their unexposed offspring (F1-F4). In the present work, we performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses on brains of zebrafish (F0-F2) from exposed and control lineages to identify molecular changes that could explain the observed phenotypes. The use of both technologies highlighted that F0 zebrafish displayed impaired mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism regulation (depletion in triacylglycerols and phospholipids) which can explain disruption of energy homeostasis. A subset of the regulated biological pathways related to energetic metabolism and neurotransmission were inherited in F2. In addition, there were increasing effects on epigenetic pathways from the F0 to the F2 generation. Altogether, we show that the effects of an environmental exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on energetic metabolism as well as neurotransmission extend over 2 generations of zebrafish, possibly due to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.	2021-02-01	2024-03-06 20:04:37	2024-03-06T20:04:37Z		142097			754		Sci Total Environ								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32911150					Animals; Brain; Brain metabolism; Danio rerio; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Lipid Metabolism; Mitochondria; Neurotoxicity; Persistent organic pollutant; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; RNA-Seq; Synaptic Transmission; Zebrafish

Tp53 Suppression Promotes Cardiomyocyte Proliferation during Zebrafish Heart Regeneration	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108089		Zebrafish regenerate heart muscle through division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. To discover underlying regulation, we assess transcriptome datasets for dynamic gene networks during heart regeneration and identify suppression of genes associated with the transcription factor Tp53. Cardiac damage leads to fluctuation of Tp53 protein levels, concomitant with induced expression of its central negative regulator, mdm2, in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis. Our findings reveal myocardial Tp53 suppression by mitogen-induced Mdm2 as a regulatory component of innate cardiac regeneration.	2020-09-01	2024-03-06 20:04:37	2024-03-06T20:04:37Z		108089		9	32		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32877671 PMCID: PMC7494019					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Genes, p53; Mdm2; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Tp53; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiomyocyte; heart regeneration; mitogen; zebrafish

We applied RiboMeth-seq to rRNA from developmental stages for profiling of 2'-O-Me, to learn if changes in methylation pattern were a component of the shift. We compiled a catalog of 2'-O-Me sites and cognate box C/D guide RNAs comprising 98 high-confidence sites, including 10 sites that were not known from other vertebrates, one of which was specific to late-type rRNA. We identified a subset of sites that changed in methylation status during development and found that some of these could be explained by availability of their cognate SNORDs. Sites that changed during development were enriched in the novel sites revealed in zebrafish. We propose that the early type of rRNA is a specialized form and that its structure and ribose methylation pattern may be an adaptation to features of development, including translation of specific maternal mRNAs.	2020-12	2024-03-06 20:04:37	2024-03-06T20:04:37Z		1919-1934		12	26		RNA								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32912962 PMCID: PMC7668251					Animals; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Methylation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Small Nucleolar; RiboMeth-seq; Ribose; Ribosomes; Zebrafish; box C/D snoRNA; ribose methylation; ribosomal RNA; zebrafish development

Here, we have developed a zebrafish model of Parkinson's disease (PD) together with a novel method to screen for movement disorders in adult fish, pioneering a more efficient drug-testing route. Mutation of the PARK7 gene (which encodes DJ-1) is known to cause monogenic autosomal recessive PD in humans, and, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated a Dj-1 loss-of-function zebrafish with molecular hallmarks of PD. To establish whether there is a human-relevant parkinsonian phenotype in our model, we adapted proven tools used to diagnose PD in clinics and developed a novel and unbiased computational method to classify movement disorders in adult zebrafish. Using high-resolution video capture and machine learning, we extracted novel features of movement from continuous data streams and used an evolutionary algorithm to classify parkinsonian fish. This method will be widely applicable for assessing zebrafish models of human motor diseases and provide a valuable asset for the therapeutics pipeline. In addition, interrogation of RNA-seq data indicate metabolic reprogramming of brains in the absence of Dj-1, adding to growing evidence that disruption of bioenergetics is a key feature of neurodegeneration.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.	2020-10-16	2024-03-06 20:04:36	2024-03-06T20:04:36Z		dmm045815		10	13		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32859696 PMCID: PMC7578351					Algorithms; Alleles; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Base Sequence; Brain; DJ-1; Disease Models, Animal; Dopaminergic Neurons; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Targeting; Gene targeting; Machine Learning; Movement; Movement Disorders; Mutation; PARK7; Parkinson Disease; Parkinson's disease; Protein Deglycase DJ-1; Video capture; Zebrafish

During this process, both differentiated cells and resident progenitors migrate to the wound site and undergo lineage-restricted, programmed cellular state transitions to populate the new regenerate. Until now, systematic characterizations of cells comprising the new regenerate and molecular definitions of their state transitions have been lacking. We hereby characterize the dynamics of gene regulatory programs during fin regeneration by creating single-cell transcriptome maps of both preinjury and regenerating fin tissues at 1/2/4 days post-amputation. We consistently identified epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic populations across all stages. We found common and cell type-specific cell cycle programs associated with proliferation. In addition to defining the processes of epithelial replenishment and mesenchymal differentiation, we also identified molecular signatures that could better distinguish epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations in fish. The insights for natural cell state transitions during regeneration point to new directions for studying this regeneration model.	2020-08	2024-03-06 20:04:36	2024-03-06T20:04:36Z		eaba2084		33	6		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32851162 PMCID: PMC7423392					Animal Fins; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Enteric glia as a source of neural progenitors in adult zebrafish	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.56086		The presence and identity of neural progenitors in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of vertebrates is a matter of intense debate. Here, we demonstrate that the non-neuronal ENS cell compartment of teleosts shares molecular and morphological characteristics with mammalian enteric glia but cannot be identified by the expression of canonical glial markers. However, unlike their mammalian counterparts, which are generally quiescent and do not undergo neuronal differentiation during homeostasis, we show that a relatively high proportion of zebrafish enteric glia proliferate under physiological conditions giving rise to progeny that differentiate into enteric neurons. We also provide evidence that, similar to brain neural stem cells, the activation and neuronal differentiation of enteric glia are regulated by Notch signalling. Our experiments reveal remarkable similarities between enteric glia and brain neural stem cells in teleosts and open new possibilities for use of mammalian enteric glia as a potential source of neurons to restore the activity of intestinal neural circuits compromised by injury or disease.	2020-08-27	2024-03-06 20:04:36	2024-03-06T20:04:36Z		e56086			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32851974 PMCID: PMC7521928					Animals; Brain; Enteric Nervous System; Mice; Neural Stem Cells; Neuroglia; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; developmental biology; enteric nervous system; glial cell; neural crest; neural progenitor; neuroscience; stem cell; zebrafish

Tbx20 Induction Promotes Zebrafish Heart Regeneration by Inducing Cardiomyocyte Dedifferentiation and Endocardial Expansion	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2020.00738		Heart regeneration requires replenishment of lost cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cells of the endocardial lining. However, the signaling regulation and transcriptional control of myocardial dedifferentiation and endocardial activation are incompletely understood during cardiac regeneration. Here, we report that T-Box Transcription Factor 20 (Tbx20) is induced rapidly in the myocardial wound edge in response to various sources of cardiac damages in zebrafish. Inducing Tbx20 specifically in the adult myocardium promotes injury-induced CM proliferation through CM dedifferentiation, leading to loss of CM cellular contacts and re-expression of cardiac embryonic or fetal gene programs. Unexpectedly, we identify that myocardial Tbx20 induction activates the endocardium at the injury site with enhanced endocardial cell extension and proliferation, where it induces the endocardial Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (Bmp6) signaling. Pharmacologically inactivating endocardial Bmp6 signaling reduces expression of its targets, Id1 and Id2b, attenuating the increased endocardial regeneration in tbx20-overexpressing hearts. Altogether, our study demonstrates that Tbx20 induction promotes adult heart regeneration by inducing cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation as well as non-cell-autonomously enhancing endocardial cell regeneration.	2020	2024-03-06 20:04:35	2024-03-06T20:04:35Z		738			8		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32850848 PMCID: PMC7417483					BMP signaling; Tbx20; cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation; endocardium; heart regeneration; zebrafish

Here, we provide a proof of principle demonstration that a type III Csm effector complex can be used for programmable mRNA transcript degradation in eukaryotes. In zebrafish, Streptococcus thermophilus Csm complex (StCsm) proved effective for knockdown of maternally expressed EGFP in germ cells of Tg(ddx4:ddx4-EGFP) fish. It also led to significant, albeit less drastic, fluorescence reduction at one day postfertilization in Tg(myl7:GFP) and Tg(fli1:EGFP) fish that express EGFP zygotically. StCsm targeted against the endogenous tdgf1 elicited the characteristic one-eyed phenotype with greater than 50% penetrance, and hence with similar efficiency to morpholino-mediated knockdown. We conclude that Csm-mediated knockdown is very efficient for maternal transcripts and can also be used for mixed maternal/early zygotic and early zygotic transcripts, in some cases reaching comparable efficiency to morpholino-based knockdown without significant off-target effects.	2020-08	2024-03-06 20:04:35	2024-03-06T20:04:35Z		299-313		4	3		CRISPR J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32833532 PMCID: PMC7469701					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Gene Editing; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Streptococcus thermophilus; Zebrafish

In these contexts, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) provides mechanistic insights by identifying transcriptome changes between experimental conditions. Application of RNA-seq relies on accurate transcript annotation for a genome of interest. Here, we find discrepancies in analysis from RNA-seq datasets quantified using Ensembl and RefSeq zebrafish annotations. These issues were due, in part, to variably annotated 3' untranslated regions and thousands of gene models missing from each annotation. Since these discrepancies could compromise downstream analyses and biological reproducibility, we built a more comprehensive zebrafish transcriptome annotation that addresses these deficiencies. Our annotation improves detection of cell type-specific genes in both bulk and single cell RNA-seq datasets, where it also improves resolution of cell clustering. Thus, we demonstrate that our new transcriptome annotation can outperform existing annotations, providing an important resource for zebrafish researchers.	2020-08-24	2024-03-06 20:04:35	2024-03-06T20:04:35Z		e55792			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32831172 PMCID: PMC7486121					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; RNA-seq; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; annotation; developmental biology; transcriptome; zebrafish

Thomas	Ganglioneuromas are driven by activated AKT and can be therapeutically targeted with mTOR inhibitors	The Journal of Experimental Medicine		1540-9538	10.1084/jem.20191871		Peripheral sympathetic nervous system tumors are the most common extracranial solid tumors of childhood and include neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma. Surgery is the only effective therapy for ganglioneuroma, which may be challenging due to the location of the tumor and involvement of surrounding structures. Thus, there is a need for well-tolerated presurgical therapies that could reduce the size and extent of ganglioneuroma and therefore limit surgical morbidity. Here, we found that an AKT-mTOR-S6 pathway was active in human ganglioneuroma but not neuroblastoma samples. Zebrafish transgenic for constitutively activated myr-Akt2 in the sympathetic nervous system were found to develop ganglioneuroma without progression to neuroblastoma. Inhibition of the downstream AKT target, mTOR, in zebrafish with ganglioneuroma effectively reduced the tumor burden. Our results implicate activated AKT as a tumorigenic driver in ganglioneuroma. We propose a clinical trial of mTOR inhibitors as a means to shrink large ganglioneuromas before resection in order to reduce surgical morbidity.	2020-10-05	2024-03-06 20:04:34	2024-03-06T20:04:34Z		e20191871		10	217		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32728700 PMCID: PMC7537400					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Ganglioneuroma; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Neuroblastoma; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zebrafish

CRISPR-Cas13d Induces Efficient mRNA Knockdown in Animal Embryos	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2020.07.013		Early embryonic development is driven exclusively by maternal gene products deposited into the oocyte. Although critical in establishing early developmental programs, maternal gene functions have remained elusive due to a paucity of techniques for their systematic disruption and assessment. CRISPR-Cas13 systems have recently been employed to degrade RNA in yeast, plants, and mammalian cell lines. However, no systematic study of the potential of Cas13 has been carried out in an animal system. Here, we show that CRISPR-RfxCas13d (CasRx) is an effective and precise system to deplete specific mRNA transcripts in zebrafish embryos. We demonstrate that zygotically expressed and maternally provided transcripts are efficiently targeted, resulting in a 76% average decrease in transcript levels and recapitulation of well-known embryonic phenotypes. Moreover, we show that this system can be used in medaka, killifish, and mouse embryos.

Mutations in FAM50A suggest that Armfield XLID syndrome is a spliceosomopathy	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-020-17452-6		Intellectual disability (ID) is a heterogeneous clinical entity and includes an excess of males who harbor variants on the X-chromosome (XLID). We report rare FAM50A missense variants in the original Armfield XLID syndrome family localized in Xq28 and four additional unrelated males with overlapping features. Our fam50a knockout (KO) zebrafish model exhibits abnormal neurogenesis and craniofacial patterning, and in vivo complementation assays indicate that the patient-derived variants are hypomorphic. RNA sequencing analysis from fam50a KO zebrafish show dysregulation of the transcriptome, with augmented spliceosome mRNAs and depletion of transcripts involved in neurodevelopment. Zebrafish RNA-seq datasets show a preponderance of 3' alternative splicing events in fam50a KO, suggesting a role in the spliceosome C complex. These data are supported with transcriptomic signatures from cell lines derived from affected individuals and FAM50A protein-protein interaction data. In sum, Armfield XLID syndrome is a spliceosomopathy associated with aberrant mRNA processing during development.	2020-07-23	2024-03-06 20:04:33	2024-03-06T20:04:33Z		3698		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32703943 PMCID: PMC7378245					Adult; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA-Binding Proteins; Family; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Mental Retardation, X-Linked; Mice; Mutation; Mutation, Missense; NIH 3T3 Cells; Pedigree; Phenotype; Protein Transport; RNA Splicing; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Nuclear; RNA-Binding Proteins; Spliceosomes; Syndrome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

By in vivo lineage tracing of ∼1,000 single zebrafish retinal progenitors, we identified a repertoire of subtype-specific stereotyped neurogenic lineages. Remarkably, within these stereotyped lineages, GABAergic amacrine cells were born with photoreceptor cells, whereas glycinergic amacrine cells were born with OFF bipolar cells. More interestingly, post-mitotic differentiation blockage of GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells resulted in their respecification into photoreceptor and bipolar cells, respectively, suggesting lineage constraint in cell subtype specification. Using single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses, we further identified lineage-specific progenitors, each defined by specific transcription factors that exhibited characteristic chromatin accessibility dynamics. Finally, single pro-neural factors could specify different neuron types/subtypes in a lineage-dependent manner. Our findings reveal the importance of lineage context in defining neuronal subtypes and provide a demonstration of in vivo lineage-dependent induction of unique retinal neuron subtypes for treatment purposes.	2020-09-07	2024-03-06 20:04:32	2024-03-06T20:04:32Z		e202003026		9	219		J Cell Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32699896 PMCID: PMC7480095					Amacrine Cells; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neurogenesis; Retina; Retinal Neurons; Zebrafish

Some OPCs differentiate rapidly as myelinating oligodendrocytes, whereas others remain into adulthood. How pMN progenitors switch from producing motor neurons to OPCs with distinct fates is poorly understood. pMN progenitors express prdm8, which encodes a transcriptional repressor, during motor neuron and OPC formation. To determine whether prdm8 controls pMN cell fate specification, we used zebrafish as a model system to investigate prdm8 function. Our analysis revealed that prdm8 mutant embryos have fewer motor neurons resulting from a premature switch from motor neuron to OPC production. Additionally, prdm8 mutant larvae have excess oligodendrocytes and a concomitant deficit of OPCs. Notably, pMN cells of mutant embryos have elevated Shh signaling, coincident with the motor neuron to OPC switch. Inhibition of Shh signaling restored the number of motor neurons to normal but did not rescue the proportion of oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that Prdm8 regulates the motor neuron-OPC switch by controlling the level of Shh activity in pMN progenitors, and also regulates the allocation of oligodendrocyte lineage cell fates.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.	2020-08-27	2024-03-06 20:04:32	2024-03-06T20:04:32Z		dev191023		16	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32680935 PMCID: PMC7473643					Animals; Cell Differentiation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Hedgehog Proteins; Histone Methyltransferases; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Motor Neurons; Motor neurons; Neural Stem Cells; Oligodendrocytes; Oligodendroglia; Signal Transduction; Sonic hedgehog; Spinal cord; Zebrafish; pMN progenitors

Leader β-cells coordinate Ca2+ dynamics across pancreatic islets in vivo	Nature Metabolism		2522-5812	10.1038/s42255-019-0075-2		Pancreatic β-cells form highly connected networks within isolated islets. Whether this behaviour pertains to the situation in vivo, after innervation and during continuous perfusion with blood, is unclear. In the present study, we used the recombinant Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6 to assess glucose-regulated connectivity in living zebrafish Danio rerio, and in murine or human islets transplanted into the anterior eye chamber. In each setting, Ca2+ waves emanated from temporally defined leader β-cells, and three-dimensional connectivity across the islet increased with glucose stimulation. Photoablation of zebrafish leader cells disrupted pan-islet signalling, identifying these as likely pacemakers. Correspondingly, in engrafted mouse islets, connectivity was sustained during prolonged glucose exposure, and super-connected 'hub' cells were identified. Granger causality analysis revealed a controlling role for temporally defined leaders, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a discrete hub cell fingerprint. We thus define a population of regulatory β-cells within coordinated islet networks in vivo. This population may drive Ca2+ dynamics and pulsatile insulin secretion.	2019-06	2024-03-06 20:04:32	2024-03-06T20:04:32Z		615-629		6	1		Nat Metab								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32694805					Animals; Calcium; Glucose; In Vitro Techniques; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

Identification and requirements of enhancers that direct gene expression during zebrafish fin regeneration	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.191262		To identify candidate tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) important for zebrafish fin regeneration, we performed ATAC-seq from bulk tissue or purified fibroblasts of uninjured and regenerating caudal fins. We identified tens of thousands of DNA regions from each sample type with dynamic accessibility during regeneration, and assigned these regions to proximal genes with corresponding expression changes by RNA-seq. To determine whether these profiles reveal bona fide TREEs, we tested the sufficiency and requirements of several sequences in stable transgenic lines and mutant lines with homozygous deletions. These experiments validated new non-coding regulatory sequences near induced and/or essential genes during fin regeneration, including fgf20a, mdka and cx43, identifying distinct domains of directed expression for each confirmed TREE. Whereas deletion of the previously identified LEN enhancer abolished detectable induction of the nearby leptin b gene during regeneration, deletions of enhancers linked to fgf20a, mdka and cx43 had no effect or partially reduced gene expression. Our study generates a new resource for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of appendage generation and reveals a range of requirements for individual TREEs in control of regeneration programs.	2020-07-30	2024-03-06 20:04:31	2024-03-06T20:04:31Z		dev191262		14	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32665240 PMCID: PMC7406312					Animal Fins; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Chromatin; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Connexin 43; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Enhancers; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Fibroblasts; Fin regeneration; Gene Expression; Genome-wide profiling; Leptin; Midkine; Regeneration; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
AVPYMJEK	journalArticle	2020	Jiang, Haowei; Pederson, Stephen Martin; Newman, Morgan; Dong, Yang; Barthelson, Karissa; Lardelli, Michael	Transcriptome analysis indicates dominant effects on ribosome and mitochondrial function of a premature termination codon mutation in the zebrafish gene psen2	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0232559		PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) is one of the genes mutated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOfAD). PSEN2 shares significant amino acid sequence identity with another EOfAD-related gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), and partial functional redundancy is seen between these two genes. However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross psen2-dependent pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of γ-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5' mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins lacking late endosomal/lysosomal localization sequences and that obey the "reading frame preservation rule" of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations. Transcriptome analysis of entire brains from a 6-month-old family of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous psen2S4Ter female siblings revealed profoundly dominant effects on gene expression likely indicating changes in ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anion transport functions.	2020	2024-03-06 20:04:31	2024-03-06T20:04:31Z		e0232559		7	15		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32658922 PMCID: PMC7357760					Alleles; Animals; Cell Count; Codon, Terminator; Gene Expression Profiling; Homozygote; Hypoxia; Mitochondria; Mutation; Neurons; Presenilin-2; RNA Stability; Ribosomes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart are sensitive to these stimuli and respond by rearranging into luminal cells subjected to shear stress and abluminal cells not exposed to it. The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells. Its loss disrupts valve morphogenesis and results in the occurrence of Notch signaling within abluminal endocardial cells. Our work explains how antagonistic activities by Vegfr3/Flt4 on the abluminal side and by Notch on the luminal side shape cardiac valve leaflets by triggering unique differences in the fates of endocardial cells.	2020-07-14	2024-03-06 20:04:31	2024-03-06T20:04:31Z		107883		2	32		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32668254					Animals; Flt4; Heart Valves; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Klf2; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Notch1; Organogenesis; Receptor, Notch1; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; biomechanics; endocardium; valvulogenesis; zebrafish

This study aimed to investigate the gene expression changes in zebrafish brains through young-adult to adult, and adult to old age. RNA sequencing was performed on isolated neuronal cells from zebrafish brains. The cells were enriched in progenitor cell markers, which are known to diminish throughout the aging process. We found 176 statistically significant, differentially expressed genes among the groups, and identified a group of genes based on gene ontology descriptions, which were classified as cell adhesion molecules. The relevance of these genes was further tested in another set of zebrafish brains, human healthy, and Alzheimer's disease brain samples, as well as in Allen Brain Atlas data. We observed that the expression change of 2 genes, GJC2 and ALCAM, during the aging process was consistent in all experimental sets. Our findings provide a new set of markers for healthy brain aging and suggest new targets for therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases.	2020-10	2024-03-06 20:04:30	2024-03-06T20:04:30Z		164-175			94		Neurobiol Aging								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32629311					Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Antigens, CD; Brain; Brain aging; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Cell adhesion molecules; Connexins; Fetal Proteins; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; RNA; RNA sequencing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Klf9 is a key feedforward regulator of the transcriptomic response to glucocorticoid receptor activity	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-020-68040-z		The zebrafish has recently emerged as a model system for investigating the developmental roles of glucocorticoid signaling and the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced developmental programming. To assess the role of the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) in such programming, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to produce a new frameshift mutation, GR369-, which eliminates all potential in-frame initiation codons upstream of the DNA binding domain. Using RNA-seq to ask how this mutation affects the larval transcriptome under both normal conditions and with chronic cortisol treatment, we find that GR mediates most of the effects of the treatment, and paradoxically, that the transcriptome of cortisol-treated larvae is more like that of larvae lacking a GR than that of larvae with a GR, suggesting that the cortisol-treated larvae develop GR resistance. The one transcriptional regulator that was both underexpressed in GR369- larvae and consistently overexpressed in cortisol-treated larvae was klf9. We therefore used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation of klf9 and RNA-seq to assess Klf9-dependent gene expression in both normal and cortisol-treated larvae. Our results indicate that Klf9 contributes significantly to the transcriptomic response to chronic cortisol exposure, mediating the upregulation of proinflammatory genes that we reported previously.	2020-07-10	2024-03-06 20:04:30	2024-03-06T20:04:30Z		11415		1	10		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32651405 PMCID: PMC7351738					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Exons; Frameshift Mutation; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Homozygote; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Inflammation; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Larva; Mutation; RNA-Seq; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The evolutionarily conserved nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades aberrant mRNAs, but also functions in the regulation of transcript abundance in response to changed physiological states. Here, we describe a zebrafish mutant of upf1, encoding the central component of the NMD machinery. Fish homozygous for the upf1t20450 allele (Y163X) survive until day 10 after fertilization, presenting with impaired T cell development as one of the most conspicuous features of the mutant phenotype. Analysis of differentially expressed genes identified dysregulation of the pre-mRNA splicing pathway, accompanied by perturbed autoregulation of canonical splicing activators (SRSF) and repressors (HNRNP). In upf1-deficient mutants, NMD-susceptible transcripts of ribosomal proteins that are known for their role as noncanonical splicing regulators were greatly increased, most notably, rpl10a When the levels of NMD-susceptible rpl10a transcripts were artificially increased in zebrafish larvae, T cell development was significantly impaired, suggesting that perturbed autoregulation of rpl10a splicing contributes to failing T cell development in upf1 deficiency. Our results identify an extraribosomal tissue-specific function to rpl10a in the immune system, and thus exemplify the advantages of the zebrafish model to study the effects of upf1-deficiency in the context of a vertebrate organism.	2020-07-07	2024-03-06 20:04:29	2024-03-06T20:04:29Z		15799-15808		27	117		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32571908 PMCID: PMC7354994					Animals; Codon, Nonsense; Fertilization; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glutathione; Homozygote; Humans; NMD; Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay; RNA Splicing; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; T-Lymphocytes; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; evolution; ribosomal protein; thymus

Thyroid hormone receptors mediate two distinct mechanisms of long-wavelength vision	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.1920086117		Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling plays an important role in the regulation of long-wavelength vision in vertebrates. In the retina, thyroid hormone receptor β (thrb) is required for expression of long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (lws) in red cone photoreceptors, while in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), TH regulates expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, cyp27c1, that converts vitamin A1 into vitamin A2 to produce a red-shifted chromophore. To better understand how TH controls these processes, we analyzed the phenotype of zebrafish with mutations in the three known TH nuclear receptor transcription factors (thraa, thrab, and thrb). We found that no single TH nuclear receptor is required for TH-mediated induction of cyp27c1 but that deletion of all three (thraa-/-;thrab-/-;thrb-/- ) completely abrogates its induction and the resulting conversion of A1- to A2-based retinoids. In the retina, loss of thrb resulted in an absence of red cones at both larval and adult stages without disruption of the underlying cone mosaic. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant down-regulation of only five genes in adult thrb-/- retina, of which three (lws1, lws2, and miR-726) occur in a single syntenic cluster. In the thrb-/- retina, retinal progenitors destined to become red cones were transfated into ultraviolet (UV) cones and horizontal cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate cooperative regulation of cyp27c1 by TH receptors and a requirement for thrb in red cone fate determination. Thus, TH signaling coordinately regulates both spectral sensitivity and sensory plasticity.	2020-06-30	2024-03-06 20:04:29	2024-03-06T20:04:29Z		15262-15269		26	117		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32541022 PMCID: PMC7334509					Animals; Color Vision; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Opsins; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells; Ultraviolet Rays; Visual Perception; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cone photoreceptors; retinal development; thyroid hormone; vitamin A2; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
23RY6759	journalArticle	2020	Safarian, Nickie; Whyte-Fagundes, Paige; Zoidl, Christiane; Grigull, Jörg; Zoidl, Georg	Visuomotor deficiency in panx1a knockout zebrafish is linked to dopaminergic signaling	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-020-66378-y		Pannexin 1 (Panx1) forms ATP-permeable membrane channels that play roles in the nervous system. The analysis of roles in both standard and pathological conditions benefits from a model organism with rapid development and early onset of behaviors. Such a model was developed by ablating the zebrafish panx1a gene using TALEN technology. Here, RNA-seq analysis of 6 days post fertilization larvae were confirmed by Real-Time PCR and paired with testing visual-motor behavior and in vivo electrophysiology. Results demonstrated that loss of panx1a specifically affected the expression of gene classes representing the development of the visual system and visual processing. Abnormal swimming behavior in the dark and the expression regulation of pre-and postsynaptic biomarkers suggested changes in dopaminergic signaling. Indeed, altered visuomotor behavior in the absence of functional Panx1a was evoked through D1/D2-like receptor agonist treatment and rescued with the D2-like receptor antagonist Haloperidol. Local field potentials recorded from superficial areas of the optic tectum receiving input from the retina confirmed abnormal responses to visual stimuli, which resembled treatments with a dopamine receptor agonist or pharmacological blocking of Panx1a. We conclude that Panx1a functions are relevant at a time point when neuronal networks supporting visual-motor functions undergo modifications preparing for complex behaviors of freely swimming fish.	2020-06-12	2024-03-06 20:04:28	2024-03-06T20:04:28Z		9538		1	10		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32533080 PMCID: PMC7293225					Animals; Connexins; Dopamine; Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists; Haloperidol; Larva; Neurons; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Retina; Signal Transduction; Superior Colliculi; Swimming; Vision, Ocular; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Mutations in EXOSC3, EXOSC8, EXOSC9, and the exosome cofactor RBM7 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and motor neuronopathy. We investigated the consequences of exosome mutations on RNA metabolism and cellular survival in zebrafish and human cell models. We observed that levels of mRNAs encoding p53 and ribosome biogenesis factors are increased in zebrafish lines with homozygous mutations of exosc8 or exosc9, respectively. Consistent with higher p53 levels, mutant zebrafish have a reduced head size, smaller brain, and cerebellum caused by an increased number of apoptotic cells during development. Down-regulation of EXOSC8 and EXOSC9 in human cells leads to p53 protein stabilisation and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Increased p53 transcript levels were also observed in muscle samples from patients with EXOSC9 mutations. Our work provides explanation for the pathogenesis of exosome-related disorders and highlights the link between exosome function, ribosome biogenesis, and p53-dependent signalling.

Hcfc1a regulates neural precursor proliferation and asxl1 expression in the developing brain	BMC neuroscience		1471-2202	10.1186/s12868-020-00577-1		BACKGROUND: Precise regulation of neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation is essential to ensure proper brain development and function. The HCFC1 gene encodes a transcriptional co-factor that regulates cell proliferation, and previous studies suggest that HCFC1 regulates NPC number and differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these cellular deficits has not been completely characterized. METHODS: Here we created a zebrafish harboring mutations in the hcfc1a gene (the hcfc1aco60/+ allele), one ortholog of HCFC1, and utilized immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing technology to understand the function of hcfc1a during neural development. RESULTS: The hcfc1aco60/+ allele results in an increased number of NPCs and increased expression of neuronal and glial markers. These neural developmental deficits are associated with larval hypomotility and the abnormal expression of asxl1, a polycomb transcription factor, which we identified as a downstream effector of hcfc1a. Inhibition of asxl1 activity and/or expression in larvae harboring the hcfc1aco60/+ allele completely restored the number of NPCs to normal levels. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrate that hcfc1a regulates NPC number, NPC proliferation, motor behavior, and brain development.	2020-06-10	2024-03-06 20:04:27	2024-03-06T20:04:27Z		27		1	21		BMC Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32522152 PMCID: PMC7288482					Animals; Brain; Brain development; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Regulation; HCFC1; Host Cell Factor C1; Neural Stem Cells; Neural precursor cells (NPCs); Neurogenesis; Neurons; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; asxl1																																																																																																																																				
X3UR7G54	journalArticle	2020	Murat El Houdigui, Sophia; Adam-Guillermin, Christelle; Armant, Olivier	Ionising Radiation Induces Promoter DNA Hypomethylation and Perturbs Transcriptional Activity of Genes Involved in Morphogenesis during Gastrulation in Zebrafish	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms21114014		Embryonic development is particularly vulnerable to stress and DNA damage, as mutations can accumulate through cell proliferation in a wide number of cells and organs. However, the biological effects of chronic exposure to ionising radiation (IR) at low and moderate dose rates (< 6 mGy/h) remain largely controversial, raising concerns for environmental protection. The present study focuses on the molecular effects of IR (0.005 to 50 mGy/h) on zebrafish embryos at the gastrula stage (6 hpf), at both the transcriptomics and epigenetics levels. Our results show that exposure to IR modifies the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial activity from 0.5 to 50 mGy/h. In addition, important developmental pathways, namely, the Notch, retinoic acid, BMP and Wnt signalling pathways, were altered at 5 and 50 mGy/h. Transcriptional changes of genes involved in the morphogenesis of the ectoderm and mesoderm were detected at all dose rates, but were prominent from 0.5 to 50 mGy/h. At the epigenetic level, exposure to IR induced a hypomethylation of DNA in the promoter of genes that colocalised with both H3K27me3 and H3Kme4 histone marks and correlated with changes in transcriptional activity. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the DNA methylation changes occurred in the promoter of important developmental genes, including morphogenesis of the ectoderm and mesoderm. Together, these results show that the transcriptional program regulating morphogenesis in gastrulating embryos was modified at dose rates greater than or equal to 0.5 mGy/h, which might predict potential neurogenesis and somitogenesis defects observed at similar dose rates later in development.	2020-06-04	2024-03-06 20:04:27	2024-03-06T20:04:27Z		4014		11	21		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32512748 PMCID: PMC7312202					AOP; Animals; Computational Biology; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Ectoderm; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mesoderm; Morphogenesis; Organogenesis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Radiation, Ionizing; Transcriptional Activation; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; development; epigenetic; gastrulation; germ layer; ionising radiation; transcriptomics; zebrafish

An ETS transcription factor Etv2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vasculogenesis. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors are identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which the Gal4 transcriptional activator is integrated into the etv2 gene locus. We observe a cell population with a skeletal muscle signature in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promote the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus restricting these cells to a vascular endothelial fate.	2020-06-03	2024-03-06 20:04:26	2024-03-06T20:04:26Z		2796		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32493965 PMCID: PMC7271194					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Biomarkers; Blood Vessels; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gene Expression Profiling; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Heat-Shock Response; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Mutation; Single-Cell Analysis; Somites; Stem Cells; Transcription, Genetic; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The physiological role of SCs is still disputed. Here, we used zebrafish to study the relevance of respiratory SCs. We combined immunodetection analysis and deep data-independent proteomics to characterize these structures and found similar SCs to those described in mice, as well as novel SCs including III2  + IV2 , I + IV, and I + III2  + IV2 . To study the physiological role of SCs, we generated two null allele zebrafish lines for supercomplex assembly factor 1 (scaf1). scaf1-/- fish displayed altered OXPHOS activity due to the disrupted interaction of complexes III and IV. scaf1-/- fish were smaller in size and showed abnormal fat deposition and decreased female fertility. These physiological phenotypes were rescued by doubling the food supply, which correlated with improved bioenergetics and alterations in the metabolic gene expression program. These results reveal that SC assembly by Scaf1 modulates OXPHOS efficiency and allows the optimization of metabolic resources.	2020-07-03	2024-03-06 20:04:26	2024-03-06T20:04:26Z		e50287		7	21		EMBO Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32496654 PMCID: PMC7332985					Animals; Electron Transport Complex IV; Energy Metabolism; Female; Mice; Mitochondrial Membranes; OXPHOS super-assembly; Oxidative Phosphorylation; SCAF1/COX7A2L; Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors; Zebrafish; metabolism; mitochondria; zebrafish

A functional benchmark dose analysis	Journal of Hazardous Materials		1873-3336	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122881		Exposure to the antifouling tributyltin (TBT) has been related to imposex in mollusks and to obesogenicity, adipogenesis and masculinization in fish. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we evaluated dose-response effects of TBT (1.7-56 nM) in zebrafish eleutheroembryos transcriptome exposed from 2 to 5 days post-fertilization. RNA-sequencing analysis identified 3238 differentially expressed transcripts in eleutheroembryos exposed to TBT. Benchmark dose analyses (BMD) showed that the point of departure (PoD) for transcriptomic effects (9.28 nM) was similar to the metabolomic PoD (11.5 nM) and about one order of magnitude lower than the morphometric PoD (67.9 nM) or the median lethal concentration (LC50: 93.6 nM). Functional analysis of BMD transcriptomic data identified steroid metabolism and cholesterol and vitamin D3 biosynthesis as the most sensitive pathways to TBT (<50% PoD). Conversely, transcripts related to general stress and DNA damage became affected only at doses above the PoD. Therefore, our results indicate that transcriptomes can act as early molecular indicators of pollutant exposure, and illustrates their usefulness for the mechanistic identification of the initial toxic events. As the estimated molecular PoDs are close to environmental levels, we concluded that TBT may represent a substantial risk in some natural environments.	2020-11-05	2024-03-06 20:01:34	2024-03-06T20:01:34Z		122881			398		J Hazard Mater								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32474318					Animals; Benchmark dose; Benchmarking; Endocrine disruption; RNA-Seq; Transcriptome; Trialkyltin Compounds; Tributyltin; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

How these factors act together in time and space, and which cell types produce these factors is not understood. Here we assess the function of Adamts3 and the related protease Adamts14 during zebrafish lymphangiogenesis and show both proteins to be able to process Vegfc. Only the simultaneous loss of both protein functions results in lymphatic defects identical to vegfc loss-of-function situations. Cell transplantation experiments demonstrate neuronal structures and/or fibroblasts to constitute cellular sources not only for both proteases but also for Ccbe1 and Vegfc. We further show that this locally restricted Vegfc maturation is needed to trigger normal lymphatic sprouting and directional migration. Our data provide a single-cell resolution model for establishing secretion and processing hubs for Vegfc during developmental lymphangiogenesis.	2020-06-01	2024-03-06 20:01:34	2024-03-06T20:01:34Z		2724		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32483144 PMCID: PMC7264274					ADAMTS Proteins; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Vessels; Microscopy, Confocal; Neurons; Procollagen N-Endopeptidase; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Calcium signaling as a possible mechanism behind increased locomotor response in zebrafish larvae exposed to a human relevant persistent organic pollutant mixture or PFOS	Environmental Research		1096-0953	10.1016/j.envres.2020.109702		Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread in the environment and their bioaccumulation can lead to adverse health effects in many organisms. Previously, using zebrafish as a model vertebrate, we found larvae exposed to a mixture of 29 POPs based on average blood levels from the Scandinavian population showed hyperactivity, and identified perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the driving agent for the behavioral changes. In order to identify possible mechanisms, we exposed zebrafish larvae from 6 to 96 h post fertilization to the same mixture of POPs in two concentrations or a single PFOS exposure (0.55 and 3.83 μM) and performed behavioral tests and transcriptomics analysis. Behavioral alterations of exposed zebrafish larvae included hyperactivity and confirmed previously reported results. Transcriptomics analysis showed upregulation of transcripts related to muscle contraction that is highly regulated by the availability of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that one of the affected pathways in larvae exposed to the POP mixture and PFOS was calcium signaling via the activation of the ryanodine receptors (RyR). Functional analyses with RyR inhibitors and behavioral outcomes substantiate these findings. Additional pathways affected were related to lipid metabolism in larvae exposed to the lower concentration of PFOS. By using omics technology, we observed that the altered behavioral pattern in exposed zebrafish larvae may be controlled directly by mechanisms affecting muscle function rather than via mechanisms connected to neurotoxicity.	2020-08	2024-03-06 20:01:33	2024-03-06T20:01:33Z		109702			187		Environ Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32474314					Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Behavior; Calcium Signaling; Calcium signaling; Danio rerio; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Larva; Ryanodine receptors; Transcriptomics; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

Whether embryonic and postembryonic retinogenesis conform to the same developmental program is an outstanding question that remains under debate. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of ∼20,000 cells of the developing zebrafish retina at four different stages, we identified seven distinct developmental states. Each state explicitly expresses a gene set. Disruption of individual state-specific marker genes results in various defects ranging from small eyes to the loss of distinct retinal cell types. Using a similar approach, we further characterized the developmental states of postembryonic retinal stem cells (RSCs) and their progeny in the ciliary marginal zone. Expression pattern analysis of state-specific marker genes showed that the developmental states of postembryonic RSCs largely recapitulated those of their embryonic counterparts, except for some differences in rod photoreceptor genesis. Thus, our findings reveal the unifying developmental program used by the embryonic and postembryonic retinogenesis in zebrafish.	2020-06-19	2024-03-06 20:01:33	2024-03-06T20:01:33Z		dev185660		12	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32467236					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; DNA-Binding Proteins; Developmental state; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neurogenesis; Retina; Retinal progenitor cells; Retinal stem cells; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Single-cell RNA sequencing; Stem Cells; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

To explore the molecular characteristics and key components of the aortic microenvironment, where the first hematopoietic stem cells are generated during development, we performed genome-wide RNA tomography sequencing on zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and human embryos. The resulting anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral transcriptional maps provided a powerful resource for exploring genes and regulatory pathways active in the aortic microenvironment. By performing interspecies comparative RNA sequencing analyses and functional assays, we explored the complexity of the aortic microenvironment landscape and the fine-tuning of various factors interacting to control hematopoietic stem cell generation, both in time and space in vivo, including the ligand-receptor couple ADM-RAMP2 and SVEP1. Understanding the regulatory function of the local environment will pave the way for improved stem cell production in vitro and clinical cell therapy.	2020-08-13	2024-03-06 20:01:33	2024-03-06T20:01:33Z		831-844		7	136		Blood								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32457985 PMCID: PMC7515669					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Aorta; Cell Tracking; Chick Embryo; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Mice; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Species Specificity; Stem Cell Niche; Tomography; Zebrafish

Heterogeneous T cell motility behaviors emerge from a coupling between speed and turning in vivo	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.53933		T cells in vivo migrate primarily via undirected random walks, but it remains unresolved how these random walks generate an efficient search. Here, we use light sheet microscopy of T cells in the larval zebrafish as a model system to study motility across large populations of cells over hours in their native context. We show that cells do not perform Levy flight; rather, there is substantial cell-to-cell variability in speed, which persists over timespans of a few hours. This variability is amplified by a correlation between speed and directional persistence, generating a characteristic cell behavioral manifold that is preserved under a perturbation to cell speeds, and seen in Mouse T cells and Dictyostelium. Together, these effects generate a broad range of length scales over which cells explore in vivo.	2020-05-19	2024-03-06 20:01:32	2024-03-06T20:01:32Z		e53933			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32427565 PMCID: PMC7237209					Animals; Cell Movement; Light; Microscopy; Models, Biological; T cells; T-Lymphocytes; Zebrafish; cell motility; light sheet microscopy; persistent random walk; physics of living systems; zebrafish

Recent transcriptome-wide studies on RNA structure have revealed its pervasive and crucial roles in RNA processing and functions, but whether and how RNA structure regulates the fate of the maternal transcriptome have yet to be determined. RESULTS: Here we establish the global map of four nucleotide-based mRNA structures by icSHAPE during zebrafish early embryogenesis. Strikingly, we observe that RNA structurally variable regions are enriched in the 3' UTR and contain cis-regulatory elements important for maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We find that the RNA-binding protein Elavl1a stabilizes maternal mRNAs by binding to the cis-elements. Conversely, RNA structure formation suppresses Elavl1a's binding leading to the decay of its maternal targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds that RNA structurally variable regions are enriched in mRNA 3' UTRs and contain cis-regulatory elements during zebrafish early embryogenesis. We reveal that Elavl1a regulates maternal RNA stability in an RNA structure-dependent fashion. Overall, our findings reveal a broad and fundamental role of RNA structure-based regulation in vertebrate early embryogenesis.	2020-05-18	2024-03-06 20:01:32	2024-03-06T20:01:32Z		120		1	21		Genome Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32423473 PMCID: PMC7236375					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; ELAV Proteins; Elavl1a; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Molecular Structure; RNA; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA Stability; RNA structure; Structure-based regulome; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zebrafish early embryogenesis

Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Mediates Larval Zebrafish Fin Duplication Following Exposure to Benzofluoranthenes	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfaa063		The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) mediates developmental toxicity of several xenobiotic classes including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Using embryonic zebrafish, we previously identified 4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that caused a novel phenotype among AHR ligands-growth of a lateral, duplicate caudal fin fold. The window of sensitivity to the most potent inducer of this phenotype, benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), was prior to 36 h postfertilization (hpf), although the phenotype was not manifest until 60 hpf. AHR dependency via Ahr2 was demonstrated using morpholino knockdown. Hepatocyte ablation demonstrated that hepatic metabolism of BkF was not required for the phenotype, nor was it responsible for the window of sensitivity. RNA sequencing performed on caudal trunk tissue from BkF-exposed animals collected at 48, 60, 72, and 96 hpf showed upregulation of genes associated with AHR activation, appendage development, and tissue patterning. Genes encoding fibroblast growth factor and bone morphogenic protein ligands, along with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, were prominently upregulated. Gene Ontology term analysis revealed that upregulated genes were enriched for mesoderm development and fin regeneration, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for Wnt signaling and neuronal development. MetaCore (Clarivate Analytics) systems analysis of orthologous human genes predicted that R-SMADs, AP-1, and LEF1 regulated the expression of an enriched number of gene targets across all time points. Our results demonstrate a novel aspect of AHR activity with implications for developmental processes conserved across vertebrate species.	2020-07-01	2024-03-06 20:01:31	2024-03-06T20:01:31Z		46-64		1	176		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32384158 PMCID: PMC7357178					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fluorenes; Larva; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; RNA sequencing; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; appendage; benzo[k]fluoranthene

Controlling this proliferation is critical to successful regeneration. Previous studies reported that retinal injury stimulates pSmad3 signaling in injury-responsive MG. Contrary to these findings, we report pSmad3 expression is restricted to quiescent MG and suppressed in injury-responsive MG. Our data indicates that Tgfb3 is the ligand responsible for regulating pSmad3 expression. Remarkably, although overexpression of either Tgfb1b or Tgfb3 can stimulate pSmad3 expression in the injured retina, only Tgfb3 inhibits injury-dependent MG proliferation; suggesting the involvement of a non-canonical Tgfb signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Alk5, PP2A or Notch signaling rescues MG proliferation in Tgfb3 overexpressing zebrafish. Finally, we report that this Tgfb3 signaling pathway is active in zebrafish MG, but not those in mice, which may contribute to the different regenerative capabilities of MG from fish and mammals.	2020-05-12	2024-03-06 20:01:31	2024-03-06T20:01:31Z		e55137			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32396062 PMCID: PMC7250569					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cellular Reprogramming; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Neuroglia; PP2A; Protein Phosphatase 2; Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I; Receptors, Notch; Retina; Signal Transduction; Smad; Smad3 Protein; Tgfb; Transforming Growth Factor beta3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; muller glia; notch; regenerative medicine; stem cell; stem cells; zebrafish

Zebrafish express high levels of fgfr3 during skull development; in order to study FGFR3's role in cranial vault development, we generated the first fgfr3 loss-of-function zebrafish (fgfr3lof/lof ). The mutant fish exhibited major changes in the craniofacial skeleton, with a lack of sutures, abnormal frontal and parietal bones, and the presence of ectopic bones. Integrated analyses (in vivo imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing of the osteoblast lineage) of zebrafish fgfr3lof/lof revealed a delay in osteoblast expansion and differentiation, together with changes in the extracellular matrix. These findings demonstrate that fgfr3 is a positive regulator of osteogenesis. We conclude that changes in the extracellular matrix within growing bone might impair cell-cell communication, mineralization, and new osteoblast recruitment. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	2020-09	2024-03-06 20:01:30	2024-03-06T20:01:30Z		1782-1797		9	35		J Bone Miner Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32379366					Animals; CRANIAL VAULT DEFECTS; Cell Differentiation; FGFR3; OSTEOBLASTS; OSTEOGENESIS; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3; Skull; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

For ribosome pauses, fundamental issues remain to be addressed, including where ribosomes pause on mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid sequence causes this pause, and the physiological significance of this attenuation of protein synthesis. Here, we survey the positions of ribosome collisions caused by ribosome pauses in humans and zebrafish using modified ribosome profiling. Collided ribosomes, i.e., disomes, emerge at various sites: Pro-Pro/Gly/Asp motifs; Arg-X-Lys motifs; stop codons; and 3' untranslated regions. The electrostatic interaction between the charged nascent chain and the ribosome exit tunnel determines the eIF5A-mediated disome rescue at the Pro-Pro sites. In particular, XBP1u, a precursor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-responsive transcription factor, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes and thus acts as a degradation substrate by ribosome-associated quality control. Our results provide insight into the causes and consequences of ribosome pause by dissecting collided ribosomes.	2020-05-05	2024-03-06 20:01:30	2024-03-06T20:01:30Z		107610		5	31		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32375038 PMCID: PMC7746506					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Codon, Terminator; Humans; Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Ribosomes; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; XBP; Zebrafish; disome; disome profiling; eIF5A; ribosome; ribosome collision; ribosome profiling; ribosome-associated quality control (RQC); translation; translation elongation

Zebrafish macrophage developmental arrest underlies depletion of microglia and reveals Csf1r-independent metaphocytes	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.53403		Macrophages derive from multiple sources of hematopoietic progenitors. Most macrophages require colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), but some macrophages persist in the absence of CSF1R. Here, we analyzed mpeg1:GFP-expressing macrophages in csf1r-deficient zebrafish and report that embryonic macrophages emerge followed by their developmental arrest. In larvae, mpeg1+ cell numbers then increased showing two distinct types in the skin: branched, putative Langerhans cells, and amoeboid cells. In contrast, although numbers also increased in csf1r-mutants, exclusively amoeboid mpeg1+ cells were present, which we showed by genetic lineage tracing to have a non-hematopoietic origin. They expressed macrophage-associated genes, but also showed decreased phagocytic gene expression and increased epithelial-associated gene expression, characteristic of metaphocytes, recently discovered ectoderm-derived cells. We further demonstrated that juvenile csf1r-deficient zebrafish exhibit systemic macrophage depletion. Thus, csf1r deficiency disrupts embryonic to adult macrophage development. Zebrafish deficient for csf1r are viable and permit analyzing the consequences of macrophage loss throughout life.	2020-05-05	2024-03-06 20:01:29	2024-03-06T20:01:29Z		e53403			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32367800 PMCID: PMC7237208					Animals; CSF1R; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Profiling; Macrophages; Microglia; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; hematopoiesis; langerhans cells; macrophages; metaphocytes; microglia; zebrafish

Previous research has shown that neurotoxic processes including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can cause secondary cell death. Nevertheless, clinical trials targeting these processes have been largely unsuccessful, suggesting that the signalling pathways underlying secondary cell death remain incompletely understood. Due to their suitability for live imaging and their amenability to genetic and pharmacological manipulation, larval zebrafish provide an ideal platform for studying the regulation of secondary cell death in vivo Here, we use RNA-seq gene expression profiling and compound screening to identify signalling pathways that regulate secondary cell death after acute neural injury in larval zebrafish. RNA-seq analysis of genes upregulated in cephalic mpeg1+ macrophage-lineage cells isolated from mpeg1:GFP transgenic larvae after neural injury suggested an involvement of cytokine and polyamine signalling in secondary cell death. Furthermore, screening a library of FDA approved compounds indicated roles for GABA, serotonin and dopamine signalling. Overall, our results highlight multiple signalling pathways that regulate secondary cell death in vivo, and thus provide a starting point for the development of novel neuroprotective treatments for patients with CNS injury.This article has an associated First Person interview with the two first authors of the paper.	2020-05-04	2024-03-06 20:01:29	2024-03-06T20:01:29Z		bio050260		5	9		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32366533 PMCID: PMC7225090					Animals; Biomarkers; Brain Injuries; CNS injury; Cell Death; Cellular signalling; Compound screen; Cytokines; Disease Susceptibility; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Larva; Macrophages; Neurons; RNA-Seq; RNA-seq; Secondary cell death; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord Injuries; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Runx1 promotes scar deposition and inhibits myocardial proliferation and survival during zebrafish heart regeneration	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.186569		Runx1 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in determining the proliferative and differential state of multiple cell types, during both development and adulthood. Here, we report how Runx1 is specifically upregulated at the injury site during zebrafish heart regeneration, and that absence of runx1 results in increased myocardial survival and proliferation, and overall heart regeneration, accompanied by decreased fibrosis. Using single cell sequencing, we found that the wild-type injury site consists of Runx1-positive endocardial cells and thrombocytes that induce expression of smooth muscle and collagen genes. Both these populations cannot be identified in runx1 mutant wounds that contain less collagen and fibrin. The reduction in fibrin in the mutant is further explained by reduced myofibroblast formation and upregulation of components of the fibrin degradation pathway, including plasminogen receptor annexin 2A as well as downregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor serpine1 in myocardium and endocardium, resulting in increased levels of plasminogen. Our findings suggest that Runx1 controls the regenerative response of multiple cardiac cell types and that targeting Runx1 is a novel therapeutic strategy for inducing endogenous heart repair.	2020-04-27	2024-03-06 20:01:28	2024-03-06T20:01:28Z		dev186569		8	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32341028 PMCID: PMC7197712					Animals; Annexin A2; Cell Proliferation; Cicatrix; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Endocardium; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart; Muscle, Smooth; Mutation; Myocardium; Myofibroblasts; Myosin Heavy Chains; Regeneration; Runx1; ScRNA-seq; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Deficiency in the autophagy modulator Dram1 exacerbates pyroptotic cell death of Mycobacteria-infected macrophages	Cell Death & Disease		2041-4889	10.1038/s41419-020-2477-1		DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) is a stress-inducible regulator of autophagy and cell death. DRAM1 has been implicated in cancer, myocardial infarction, and infectious diseases, but the molecular and cellular functions of this transmembrane protein remain poorly understood. Previously, we have proposed DRAM1 as a host resistance factor for tuberculosis (TB) and a potential target for host-directed anti-infective therapies. In this study, we generated a zebrafish dram1 mutant and investigated its loss-of-function effects during Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) infection, a widely used model in TB research. In agreement with previous knockdown analysis, dram1 mutation increased the susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to Mm infection. RNA sequencing revealed major effects of Dram1 deficiency on metabolic, immune response, and cell death pathways during Mm infection, and only minor effects on proteinase and metabolic pathways were found under uninfected conditions. Furthermore, unchallenged dram1 mutants did not display overt autophagic defects, but autophagic targeting of Mm was reduced in the absence of Dram1. The phagocytic ability of macrophages in dram1 mutants was unaffected, but acidification of Mm-containing vesicles was strongly reduced, indicating that Dram1 is required for phagosome maturation. By in vivo imaging, we observed that Dram1-deficient macrophages fail to restrict Mm during early stages of infection. The resulting increase in bacterial burden could be reverted by knockdown of inflammatory caspase a (caspa) and gasdermin Eb (gsdmeb), demonstrating pyroptosis as the mechanism underlying premature cell death of Mm-infected macrophages in dram1 mutants. Collectively, these data demonstrate that dissemination of mycobacterial infection in zebrafish larvae is promoted in the absence of Dram1 due to reduced maturation of mycobacteria-containing vesicles, failed intracellular containment, and consequent pyroptotic death of infected macrophages. These results provide new evidence that Dram1 plays a central role in host resistance to intracellular infection, acting at the crossroad of autophagy and cell death.	2020-04-24	2024-03-06 20:01:28	2024-03-06T20:01:28Z		277		4	11		Cell Death Dis								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32332700 PMCID: PMC7181687					Animals; Autophagy; Cell Death; Humans; Macrophages; Membrane Proteins; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Pyroptosis; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish

Due to the difficulty of live-imaging in the bone, however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying intercellular communication involved in OC differentiation are still elusive. Here, we develop a fracture healing model using the scale of trap:GFP; osterix:mCherry transgenic zebrafish to visualize the interaction between OCs and OBs. Transplantation assays followed by flow cytometric analysis reveal that most trap:GFPhigh OCs in the fractured scale are detected in the osterix:mCherry+ fraction because of uptake of OB-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). In vivo live-imaging shows that immature OCs actively interact with osterix:mCherry+ OBs and engulf EVs prior to convergence at the fracture site. In vitro cell culture assays show that OB-derived EVs promote OC differentiation via Rankl signaling. Collectively, these data suggest that EV-mediated intercellular communication with OBs plays an important role in the differentiation of OCs in bone tissue.	2020-04-23	2024-03-06 20:01:28	2024-03-06T20:01:28Z		190		1	3		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32327701 PMCID: PMC7181839					Animal Scales; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular Vesicles; Fracture Healing; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Luminescent Proteins; Models, Animal; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Red Fluorescent Protein; Zebrafish

Nodal signaling is essential for patterning of the AP axis while planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells with respect to this axis, but how these two signaling systems interact during C and E is unclear. We find that the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient zebrafish gastrulae exhibits reduced C and E cell behaviors, which require Nodal signaling in both cell- and non-autonomous fashions. PCP signaling is partially active in Nodal-deficient embryos and its inhibition exacerbates their C and E defects. Within otherwise naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants, however, Nodal induces C and E in a largely PCP-dependent manner, arguing that Nodal acts both upstream of and in parallel with PCP during gastrulation to regulate embryonic axis extension cooperatively.	2020-04-22	2024-03-06 20:01:27	2024-03-06T20:01:27Z		e54445			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32319426 PMCID: PMC7250581					Animals; Blastoderm; Body Patterning; Cell Polarity; Gastrulation; Nodal Protein; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; convergence & extension; developmental biology; embryo; gastrulation; morphogenesis; nodal; planar cell polarity; zebrafish

Retinoic Acid Organizes the Zebrafish Vagus Motor Topographic Map via Spatiotemporal Coordination of Hgf/Met Signaling	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2020.03.017		Information flow through neural circuits often requires their organization into topographic maps in which the positions of cell bodies and synaptic targets correspond. To understand how topographic map development is controlled, we examine the mechanism underlying targeting of vagus motor axons to the pharyngeal arches in zebrafish. We reveal that retinoic acid organizes topography by specifying anterior-posterior identity in vagus motor neurons. We then show that chemoattractant signaling between Hgf and Met is required for vagus innervation of the pharyngeal arches. Finally, we find that retinoic acid controls the spatiotemporal dynamics of Hgf/Met signaling to coordinate axon targeting with the developmental progression of the pharyngeal arches and show that experimentally altering the timing of Hgf/Met signaling is sufficient to redirect axon targeting and disrupt the topographic map. These findings establish a mechanism of topographic map development in which the regulation of chemoattractant signaling in space and time guides axon targeting.	2020-05-04	2024-03-06 20:01:27	2024-03-06T20:01:27Z		344-357.e5		3	53		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32302545 PMCID: PMC7237105					Animals; Branchial Region; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Keratolytic Agents; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Signal Transduction; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Tretinoin; Vagus Nerve; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; axon guidance; hepatocyte growth factor; met; motor neuron; nervous system development; pharyngeal arch; retinoic acid; topographic map; vagus; zebrafish

Wnt signaling regulates neural plate patterning in distinct temporal phases with dynamic transcriptional outputs	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.03.016		The process that partitions the nascent vertebrate central nervous system into forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord after neural induction is of fundamental interest in developmental biology, and is known to be dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling at multiple steps. Neural induction specifies neural ectoderm with forebrain character that is subsequently posteriorized by graded Wnt signaling: embryological and mutant analyses have shown that progressively higher levels of Wnt signaling induce progressively more posterior fates. However, the mechanistic link between Wnt signaling and the molecular subdivision of the neural ectoderm into distinct domains in the anteroposterior (AP) axis is still not clear. To better understand how Wnt mediates neural AP patterning, we performed a temporal dissection of neural patterning in response to manipulations of Wnt signaling in zebrafish. We show that Wnt-mediated neural patterning in zebrafish can be divided into three phases: (I) a primary AP patterning phase, which occurs during gastrulation, (II) a mes/r1 (mesencephalon-rhombomere 1) specification and refinement phase, which occurs immediately after gastrulation, and (III) a midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) morphogenesis phase, which occurs during segmentation stages. A major outcome of these Wnt signaling phases is the specification of the major compartment divisions of the developing brain: first the MHB, then the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary (DMB). The specification of these lineage divisions depends upon the dynamic changes of gene transcription in response to Wnt signaling, which we show primarily involves transcriptional repression or indirect activation. We show that otx2b is directly repressed by Wnt signaling during primary AP patterning, but becomes resistant to Wnt-mediated repression during late gastrulation. Also during late gastrulation, Wnt signaling becomes both necessary and sufficient for expression of wnt8b, en2a, and her5 in mes/r1. We suggest that the change in otx2b response to Wnt regulation enables a transition to the mes/r1 phase of Wnt-mediated patterning, as it ensures that Wnts expressed in the midbrain and MHB do not suppress midbrain identity, and consequently reinforce formation of the DMB. These findings integrate important temporal elements into our spatial understanding of Wnt-mediated neural patterning and may serve as an important basis for a better understanding of neural patterning defects that have implications in human health.	2020-06-15	2024-03-06 20:01:26	2024-03-06T20:01:26Z		152-164		2	462		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32243887 PMCID: PMC7268091					Animals; Anterior posterior patterning; Body Patterning; Diencephalon; Ectoderm; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gastrula; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Homeodomain Proteins; Mes/r1; Mesencephalon; Midbrain-hindbrain boundary; Nervous System; Neural Plate; Neural plate; RNA-Seq; Rhombencephalon; Vertebrate; Wnt; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; otx2

Such incomplete phenotypic penetrance, or genetic compensation, is more commonly found in stable knockout models, rather than transient knockdown models. As such, these incidents present a challenge for the disease modeling field, although a deeper understanding of genetic compensation may also hold the key for novel therapeutic interventions. In our study we created a knockout model of slc25a46 gene, which is a recently discovered important player in mitochondrial dynamics, and deleterious mutations in which are known to cause peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy and cerebellar ataxia. We report a case of genetic compensation in a stable slc25a46 homozygous zebrafish mutant (hereafter referred as "mutant"), in contrast to a penetrant disease phenotype in the first generation (F0) slc25a46 mosaic mutant (hereafter referred as "crispant"), generated with CRISPR/Cas-9 technology. We show that the crispant phenotype is specific and rescuable. By performing mRNA sequencing, we define significant changes in slc25a46 mutant's gene expression profile, which are largely absent in crispants. We find that among the most significantly altered mRNAs, anxa6 gene stands out as a functionally relevant player in mitochondrial dynamics. We also find that our genetic compensation case does not arise from mechanisms driven by mutant mRNA decay. Our study contributes to the growing evidence of the genetic compensation phenomenon and presents novel insights about Slc25a46 function. Furthermore, our study provides the evidence for the efficiency of F0 CRISPR screens for disease candidate genes, which may be used to advance the field of functional genetics.	2020	2024-03-06 20:01:26	2024-03-06T20:01:26Z		e0230566		3	15		PLoS One	Genetic compensation in a stable slc25a46 mutant zebrafish							eng					PubMed		PMID: 32208444 PMCID: PMC7092968					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cerebellar Ataxia; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Targeting; Male; Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Optic Atrophy; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Despite its high incidence, there is no consensus on the implications of PAE on metabolic disease risk in adults. Here, we describe a cohort of adults with FASDs that had an increased incidence of metabolic abnormalities, including type 2 diabetes, low HDL, high triglycerides, and female-specific overweight and obesity. Using a zebrafish model for PAE, we performed population studies to elucidate the metabolic disease seen in the clinical cohort. Embryonic alcohol exposure (EAE) in male zebrafish increased the propensity for diet-induced obesity and fasting hyperglycemia in adulthood. We identified several consequences of EAE that may contribute to these phenotypes, including a reduction in adult locomotor activity, alterations in visceral adipose tissue and hepatic development, and persistent diet-responsive transcriptional changes. Taken together, our findings define metabolic vulnerabilities due to EAE and provide evidence that behavioral changes and primary organ dysfunction contribute to resultant metabolic abnormalities.	2020-05-01	2024-03-06 20:01:25	2024-03-06T20:01:25Z		2252-2269		5	130		J Clin Invest								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32202514 PMCID: PMC7190939					Adult; Animals; Development; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Embryonic development; Female; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Liver; Male; Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Registries; Zebrafish

It requires an efficient translation of lens messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to overcome the progressively reduced transcriptional activity that results from denucleation. Inappropriate regulation of this process impairs lens differentiation and causes cataract formation. However, the regulatory mechanism promoting protein synthesis from lens-expressed mRNAs remains unclear. Here we show that in zebrafish, the RNA-binding protein Rbm24 is critically required for the accumulation of crystallin proteins and terminal differentiation of lens fiber cells. In the developing lens, Rbm24 binds to a wide spectrum of lens-specific mRNAs through the RNA recognition motif and interacts with cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (Cpeb1b) and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (Pabpc1l) through the C-terminal region. Loss of Rbm24 reduces the stability of a subset of lens mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins and shortens the poly(A) tail length of crystallin mRNAs encoding lens structural components, thereby preventing their translation into functional proteins. This severely impairs lens transparency and results in blindness. Consistent with its highly conserved expression in differentiating lens fiber cells, the findings suggest that vertebrate Rbm24 represents a key regulator of cytoplasmic polyadenylation and plays an essential role in the posttranscriptional control of lens development.	2020-03-31	2024-03-06 20:01:25	2024-03-06T20:01:25Z		7245-7254		13	117		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32170011 PMCID: PMC7132282					Animals; Cataract; Crystallins; Cytoplasm; Lens, Crystalline; Models, Animal; Polyadenylation; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; Rbm24; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cataract; cytoplasmic polyadenylation; lens; zebrafish

Here, we generated a transgenic zebrafish line carrying a destabilized fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of a core clock gene, nr1d1, to report in vivo circadian rhythm at the single-cell level. By time-lapse imaging of this fish line and 3D reconstruction, we observed the sequential initiation of the reporter expression starting at photoreceptors in the pineal gland, then spreading to the cells in other brain regions at the single-cell level. Even within the pineal gland, we found heterogeneous onset of nr1d1 expression, in which each cell undergoes circadian oscillation superimposed over a cell type-specific developmental trajectory. Furthermore, we found that single-cell expression of nr1d1 showed synchronous circadian oscillation under a light-dark (LD) cycle. Remarkably, single-cell oscillations were dramatically dampened rather than desynchronized in animals raised under constant darkness, while the developmental trend still persists. It suggests that light exposure in early zebrafish embryos has significant effect on cellular circadian oscillations.	2020-03	2024-03-06 20:01:24	2024-03-06T20:01:24Z		e3000435		3	18		PLoS Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32168317 PMCID: PMC7069618					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Bacterial Proteins; Brain; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Luminescent Proteins; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1; Photoperiod; Pineal Gland; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Single-Cell Analysis; Time-Lapse Imaging; Zebrafish

Albert	Deficiency in the endocytic adaptor proteins PHETA1/2 impairs renal and craniofacial development	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.041913		A critical barrier in the treatment of endosomal and lysosomal diseases is the lack of understanding of the in vivo functions of the putative causative genes. We addressed this by investigating a key pair of endocytic adaptor proteins, PH domain-containing endocytic trafficking adaptor 1 and 2 (PHETA1/2; also known as FAM109A/B, Ses1/2, IPIP27A/B), which interact with the protein product of OCRL, the causative gene for Lowe syndrome. Here, we conducted the first study of PHETA1/2 in vivo, utilizing the zebrafish system. We found that impairment of both zebrafish orthologs, pheta1 and pheta2, disrupted endocytosis and ciliogenesis in renal tissues. In addition, pheta1/2 mutant animals exhibited reduced jaw size and delayed chondrocyte differentiation, indicating a role in craniofacial development. Deficiency of pheta1/2 resulted in dysregulation of cathepsin K, which led to an increased abundance of type II collagen in craniofacial cartilages, a marker of immature cartilage extracellular matrix. Cathepsin K inhibition rescued the craniofacial phenotypes in the pheta1/2 double mutants. The abnormal renal and craniofacial phenotypes in the pheta1/2 mutant animals were consistent with the clinical presentation of a patient with a de novo arginine (R) to cysteine (C) variant (R6C) of PHETA1. Expressing the patient-specific variant in zebrafish exacerbated craniofacial deficits, suggesting that the R6C allele acts in a dominant-negative manner. Together, these results provide insights into the in vivo roles of PHETA1/2 and suggest that the R6C variant is contributory to the pathogenesis of disease in the patient.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.	2020-05-26	2024-03-06 20:01:24	2024-03-06T20:01:24Z		dmm041913		5	13		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32152089 PMCID: PMC7272357					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cathepsin K; Cell Differentiation; Chondrocytes; Cilia; Collagen Type II; Endocytosis; Face; Genes, Dominant; HeLa Cells; Humans; IPIP27A; Kidney; Morphogenesis; Motor Activity; Mutation; OCRL; PHETA1; Pronephros; Skull; Undiagnosed Diseases; Undiagnosed disease; Vesicular Transport Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

A notable exception occurs in the vertebrate vestibular system and lateral-line neuromasts, where mechanosensory hair cells orient along a single axis but in opposite directions to generate bipolar epithelia [3-5]. In zebrafish neuromasts, pairs of hair cells arise from the division of a non-sensory progenitor [6, 7] and acquire opposing planar polarity via the asymmetric expression of the polarity-determinant transcription factor Emx2 [8-11]. Here, we reveal the initial symmetry-breaking step by decrypting the developmental trajectory of hair cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), diffusion pseudotime analysis, lineage tracing, and mutagenesis. We show that Emx2 is absent in non-sensory epithelial cells, begins expression in hair-cell progenitors, and is downregulated in one of the sibling hair cells via signaling through the Notch1a receptor. Analysis of Emx2-deficient specimens, in which every hair cell adopts an identical direction, indicates that Emx2 asymmetry does not result from auto-regulatory feedback. These data reveal a two-tiered mechanism by which the symmetric monodirectional ground state of the epithelium is inverted by deterministic initiation of Emx2 expression in hair-cell progenitors and a subsequent stochastic repression of Emx2 in one of the sibling hair cells breaks directional symmetry to establish planar bipolarity.	2020-03-23	2024-03-06 20:01:23	2024-03-06T20:01:23Z		1142-1151.e6		6	30		Curr Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32109392					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeodomain Proteins; Lateral Line System; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Receptor, Notch1; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; diffusion pseudotime; hair cells; planar polarity; single-cell RNA sequencing

Although the molecular alterations that drive the progression of primary melanoma to metastatic disease have been studied extensively, the early progression of noninvasive primary melanoma to an invasive state is poorly understood. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the transition from radial to vertical growth, the first step in melanoma invasion, we developed a zebrafish melanoma model in which constitutive activation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1 drives tumor invasion. Transcriptomic analysis of ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1-activated tumors identified metabolic changes, including up-regulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation. Vertical growth phase human melanoma cells show higher oxygen consumption and preferential utilization of glutamine compared to radial growth phase melanoma cells. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α, has been proposed as a master regulator of tumor oxidative phosphorylation. In human primary melanoma specimens, PGC1α protein expression was found to be positively associated with increased tumor thickness and expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 and the reactive oxygen species scavenger receptor class A member 3. PGC1α depletion modulated cellular processes associated with primary melanoma growth and invasion, including oxidative stress. These results support a role for PGC1α in mediating glutamine-driven oxidative phosphorylation to facilitate the invasive growth of primary melanoma.	2020-05	2024-03-06 20:01:23	2024-03-06T20:01:23Z		1108-1117		5	190		Am J Pathol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32142731 PMCID: PMC7237828					Animals; Heterografts; Humans; Melanoma; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Zebrafish

However, the toxic effects of GO on the vertebrate developmental system are still poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of GO exposure in larval and adult zebrafish. The results showed that the major hepatotoxic phenotype induced by GO in zebrafish embryos was a significant decrease in liver area and a dose-dependent decrease in the hepatocytes. Moreover, the number of macrophages and neutrophils in zebrafish embryos were reduced but the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased after GO treatment. High through-put RNA-Seq identified 314 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GO-induced zebrafish embryos including 192 up-regulated and 122 down-regulated. KEGG and GO functional analysis revealed that steroid hormone biosynthesis, lipoprotein metabolic process, and PPAR signaling pathway were significantly enriched. Most of the lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated while majority of the immune genes were up-regulated after GO treatment. Moreover, GO induced NF-κB p65 into the nucleus and increased the protein levels of NF-κB p65, JAK2, STAT3, and Bcl2 in adult zebrafish liver. In addition, pharmacological experiments showed that inhibition of ROS and blocking the MAPK signaling could rescue the hepatotoxic phenotypes induced by GO exposure. On the contrary, pharmacological activation of PPAR-α expression have increased the hepatotoxic effects in GO-induced larval and adult zebrafish. Taken together, these informations demonstrated that GO induced hepatic dysfunction mainly through the ROS and PPAR-α mediated innate immune signaling in zebrafish.	2020-06	2024-03-06 20:01:23	2024-03-06T20:01:23Z		667-682		5	14		Nanotoxicology								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32141807					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation; Graphene oxide; Graphite; Immunity, Innate; Larva; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Macrophages; Nanoparticles; Neutrophils; RNA-Seq; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; hepatic dysfunction; inflammation; zebrafish

Regenerating zebrafish fin epigenome is characterized by stable lineage-specific DNA methylation and dynamic chromatin accessibility	Genome Biology		1474-760X	10.1186/s13059-020-1948-0		BACKGROUND: Zebrafish can faithfully regenerate injured fins through the formation of a blastema, a mass of proliferative cells that can grow and develop into the lost body part. After amputation, various cell types contribute to blastema formation, where each cell type retains fate restriction and exclusively contributes to regeneration of its own lineage. Epigenetic changes that are associated with lineage restriction during regeneration remain underexplored. RESULTS: We produce epigenome maps, including DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, as well as transcriptomes, of osteoblasts and other cells in uninjured and regenerating fins. This effort reveals regeneration as a process of highly dynamic and orchestrated transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes, coupled with stably maintained lineage-specific DNA methylation. The epigenetic signatures also reveal many novel regeneration-specific enhancers, which are experimentally validated. Regulatory networks important for regeneration are constructed through integrative analysis of the epigenome map, and a knockout of a predicted upstream regulator disrupts normal regeneration, validating our prediction. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that lineage-specific DNA methylation signatures are stably maintained during regeneration, and regeneration enhancers are preset as hypomethylated before injury. In contrast, chromatin accessibility is dynamically changed during regeneration. Many enhancers driving regeneration gene expression as well as upstream regulators of regeneration are identified and validated through integrative epigenome analysis.	2020-02-27	2024-03-06 20:01:22	2024-03-06T20:01:22Z		52		1	21		Genome Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32106888 PMCID: PMC7047409					Animal Fins; Animals; Cell Lineage; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Chromatin accessibility; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Epigenome; Fate restriction; Fin; Gene Regulatory Networks; Osteoblast; Osteoblasts; Regeneration; Zebrafish

A single cell transcriptome atlas of the developing zebrafish hindbrain	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.184143		Segmentation of the vertebrate hindbrain leads to the formation of rhombomeres, each with a distinct anteroposterior identity. Specialised boundary cells form at segment borders that act as a source or regulator of neuronal differentiation. In zebrafish, there is spatial patterning of neurogenesis in which non-neurogenic zones form at boundaries and segment centres, in part mediated by Fgf20 signalling. To further understand the control of neurogenesis, we have carried out single cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish hindbrain at three different stages of patterning. Analyses of the data reveal known and novel markers of distinct hindbrain segments, of cell types along the dorsoventral axis, and of the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation. We find major shifts in the transcriptome of progenitors and of differentiating cells between the different stages analysed. Supervised clustering with markers of boundary cells and segment centres, together with RNA-seq analysis of Fgf-regulated genes, has revealed new candidate regulators of cell differentiation in the hindbrain. These data provide a valuable resource for functional investigations of the patterning of neurogenesis and the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation.	2020-03-16	2024-03-06 20:01:21	2024-03-06T20:01:21Z		dev184143		6	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32094115 PMCID: PMC7097387					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Atlases as Topic; Body Patterning; Cell Differentiation; Dorsoventral patterning; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fgf signalling; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hindbrain boundary; Hindbrain segmentation; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Rhombencephalon; Single cell RNA sequencing; Single-Cell Analysis; Tissue Distribution; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

New insights into the early mechanisms of epileptogenesis in a zebrafish model of Dravet syndrome	Epilepsia		1528-1167	10.1111/epi.16456		OBJECTIVE: To pinpoint the earliest cellular defects underlying seizure onset (epileptogenic period) during perinatal brain development in a new zebrafish model of Dravet syndrome (DS) and to investigate potential disease-modifying activity of the 5HT2 receptor agonist fenfluramine. METHODS: We used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to introduce a missense mutation, designed to perturb ion transport function in all channel isoforms, into scn1lab, the zebrafish orthologue of SCN1A (encoding voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit 1). We performed behavioral analysis and electroencephalographic recordings to measure convulsions and epileptiform discharges, followed by single-cell RNA-Seq, morphometric analysis of transgenic reporter-labeled γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, and pharmacological profiling of mutant larvae. RESULTS: Homozygous mutant (scn1labmut/mut ) larvae displayed spontaneous seizures with interictal, preictal, and ictal discharges (mean = 7.5 per 20-minute recording; P < .0001; one-way analysis of variance). Drop-Seq analysis revealed a 2:1 shift in the ratio of glutamatergic to GABAergic neurons in scn1labmut/mut larval brains versus wild type (WT), with dynamic changes in neuronal, glial, and progenitor cell populations. To explore disease pathophysiology further, we quantified dendritic arborization in GABAergic neurons and observed a 40% reduction in arbor number compared to WT (P < .001; n = 15 mutant, n = 16 WT). We postulate that the significant reduction in inhibitory arbors causes an inhibitory to excitatory neurotransmitter imbalance that contributes to seizures and enhanced electrical brain activity in scn1labmut/mut larvae (high-frequency range), with subsequent GABAergic neuronal loss and astrogliosis. Chronic fenfluramine administration completely restored dendritic arbor numbers to normal in scn1labmut/mut larvae, whereas similar treatment with the benzodiazepine diazepam attenuated seizures, but was ineffective in restoring neuronal cytoarchitecture. BrdU labeling revealed cell overproliferation in scn1labmut/mut larval brains that were rescued by fenfluramine but not diazepam. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide novel insights into early mechanisms of DS pathogenesis, describe dynamic cell population changes in the scn1labmut/mut brain, and present first-time evidence for potential disease modification by fenfluramine.	2020-03	2024-03-06 20:01:21	2024-03-06T20:01:21Z		549-560		3	61		Epilepsia								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32096222					Animals; Anticonvulsants; Brain; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Proliferation; Diazepam; Disease Models, Animal; Dravet syndrome; Electroencephalography; Epilepsies, Myoclonic; Fenfluramine; GABAergic Neurons; Gene Expression Profiling; Gliosis; Locomotion; Mutation, Missense; NAV1.1 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel; Neuronal Plasticity; RNA-Seq; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; epileptogenesis; fenfluramine; sodium channel; zebrafish

Pbx4 limits heart size and fosters arch artery formation by partitioning second heart field progenitors and restricting proliferation	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.185652		Vertebrate heart development requires the integration of temporally distinct differentiating progenitors. However, few signals are understood that restrict the size of the later-differentiating outflow tract (OFT). We show that improper specification and proliferation of second heart field (SHF) progenitors in zebrafish lazarus (lzr) mutants, which lack the transcription factor Pbx4, produces enlarged hearts owing to an increase in ventricular and smooth muscle cells. Specifically, Pbx4 initially promotes the partitioning of the SHF into anterior progenitors, which contribute to the OFT, and adjacent endothelial cell progenitors, which contribute to posterior pharyngeal arches. Subsequently, Pbx4 limits SHF progenitor (SHFP) proliferation. Single cell RNA sequencing of nkx2.5+ cells revealed previously unappreciated distinct differentiation states and progenitor subpopulations that normally reside within the SHF and arterial pole of the heart. Specifically, the transcriptional profiles of Pbx4-deficient nkx2.5+ SHFPs are less distinct and display characteristics of normally discrete proliferative progenitor and anterior, differentiated cardiomyocyte populations. Therefore, our data indicate that the generation of proper OFT size and arch arteries requires Pbx-dependent stratification of unique differentiation states to facilitate both homeotic-like transformations and limit progenitor production within the SHF.	2020-03-02	2024-03-06 20:01:21	2024-03-06T20:01:21Z		dev185652		5	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32094112 PMCID: PMC7063670					Animals; Aorta, Thoracic; Branchial Region; Cardiomegaly; Cell Proliferation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Heart; Heart development; Myocytes, Cardiac; Outflow tract; Pbx transcription factor; Pharyngeal arch arteries; Second heart field; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Functional Heterogeneity within the Developing Zebrafish Epicardium	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2020.01.023		The epicardium is essential during cardiac development, homeostasis, and repair, and yet fundamental insights into its underlying cell biology, notably epicardium formation, lineage heterogeneity, and functional cross-talk with other cell types in the heart, are currently lacking. In this study, we investigated epicardial heterogeneity and the functional diversity of discrete epicardial subpopulations in the developing zebrafish heart. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered three epicardial subpopulations with specific genetic programs and distinctive spatial distribution. Perturbation of unique gene signatures uncovered specific functions associated with each subpopulation and established epicardial roles in cell adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis as a mechanism for recruitment of leukocytes into the heart. Understanding which mechanisms epicardial cells employ to establish a functional epicardium and how they communicate with other cardiovascular cell types during development will bring us closer to repairing cellular relationships that are disrupted during cardiovascular disease.	2020-03-09	2024-03-06 20:01:20	2024-03-06T20:01:20Z		574-590.e6		5	52		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32084358 PMCID: PMC7063573					Animals; Cell Lineage; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Pericardium; RNA-Seq; RNA-seq; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; development; epicardium; heart; heterogeneity; single cell; zebrafish

It remains unclear whether such heterogeneity reflects different subtypes of cells with distinct functions or instead reflects transiently acquired states of cells with the same function. By integrating lineage formation of individual OPC clones, single-cell transcriptomics, calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation, we show that OPCs in the zebrafish spinal cord can be divided into two functionally distinct groups. One subgroup forms elaborate networks of processes and exhibits a high degree of calcium signaling, but infrequently differentiates despite contact with permissive axons. Instead, these OPCs divide in an activity- and calcium-dependent manner to produce another subgroup, with higher process motility and less calcium signaling and that readily differentiates. Our data show that OPC subgroups are functionally diverse in their response to neurons and that activity regulates the proliferation of a subset of OPCs that is distinct from the cells that generate differentiated oligodendrocytes.	2020-03	2024-03-06 20:01:20	2024-03-06T20:01:20Z		363-374		3	23		Nat Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32066987 PMCID: PMC7292734					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Calcium Signaling; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Net; Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells; Spinal Cord; Swimming; Zebrafish

However, the current understanding of MP toxicity is based on cell population-averaged measurements. Our aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the size-dependent effects of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) on intestinal cell populations in zebrafish and characterize the interplay of MPs, intestinal cells, and intestinal microbiota. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome heterogeneity of 12 000 intestinal cells obtained from zebrafish exposed to 100 nm, 5 μm, and 200 μm PS-MPs for 21 days. Eight intestinal cell populations were identified. Combined with changes in intestinal microbiota, our findings highlight a previously unrecognized end point that all three sizes of PS-MPs induced dysfunction of intestinal immune cells (including effects on phagosomes and the regulation of immune system processes) and increased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. However, only 100 nm PS-MPs altered the expression of genes related to phagocyte-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased mucus secretion by secretory cells. Microsize PS-MPs specifically changed the lysosome (5 μm) and cell surface receptor signaling (200 μm) processes of the macrophages. Our findings pinpoint to cell-specific and size-dependent responses to PS-MPs in fish intestine, which can provide a reference for future study directions.	2020-03-17	2024-03-06 20:01:20	2024-03-06T20:01:20Z		3417-3427		6	54		Environ Sci Technol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32092251					Animals; Intestines; Microplastics; Plastics; Polystyrenes; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

Life Sciences		1869-1889	10.1007/s11427-020-1631-9		Mammalian mitochondria have small genomes encoding very limited numbers of proteins. Over one thousand proteins and noncoding RNAs encoded by the nuclear genome must be imported from the cytosol into the mitochondria. Here, we report the identification of hundreds of circular RNAs (mecciRNAs) encoded by the mitochondrial genome. We provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that mecciRNAs facilitate the mitochondrial entry of nuclear-encoded proteins by serving as molecular chaperones in the folding of imported proteins. Known components involved in mitochondrial protein and RNA importation, such as TOM40 and PNPASE, interact with mecciRNAs and regulate protein entry. The expression of mecciRNAs is regulated, and these transcripts are critical for the adaption of mitochondria to physiological conditions and diseases such as stresses and cancers by modulating mitochondrial protein importation. mecciRNAs and their associated physiological roles add categories and functions to the known eukaryotic circular RNAs and shed novel light on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus.	2020-10	2024-03-06 20:01:19	2024-03-06T20:01:19Z		1429-1449		10	63		Sci China Life Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32048164					Animals; Cell Nucleus; Gene Expression; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Humans; Mice; Mitochondria; Molecular Chaperones; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; RNA, Circular; RNA, Mitochondrial; Replication Protein A; Zebrafish; circRNA; mecciRNA; mitochondria; mitochondrial protein import

Analysis of zebrafish periderm enhancers facilitates identification of a regulatory variant near human KRT8/18	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.51325		Genome-wide association studies for non-syndromic orofacial clefting (OFC) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at loci where the presumed risk-relevant gene is expressed in oral periderm. The functional subsets of such SNPs are difficult to predict because the sequence underpinnings of periderm enhancers are unknown. We applied ATAC-seq to models of human palate periderm, including zebrafish periderm, mouse embryonic palate epithelia, and a human oral epithelium cell line, and to complementary mesenchymal cell types. We identified sets of enhancers specific to the epithelial cells and trained gapped-kmer support-vector-machine classifiers on these sets. We used the classifiers to predict the effects of 14 OFC-associated SNPs at 12q13 near KRT18. All the classifiers picked the same SNP as having the strongest effect, but the significance was highest with the classifier trained on zebrafish periderm. Reporter and deletion analyses support this SNP as lying within a periderm enhancer regulating KRT18/KRT8 expression.	2020-02-07	2024-03-06 20:01:19	2024-03-06T20:01:19Z		e51325			9		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32031521 PMCID: PMC7039683					Animals; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Keratin-18; Keratin-8; Palate; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Zebrafish; computational biology; developmental biology; enhancers; human; machine learning; mouse; orofacial cleft; periderm; systems biology; zebrafish

However, their roles in physiological conditions in the brain remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we analysed the telencephalon in Grn-deficient zebrafish and identified morphological and transcriptional changes in microglial cells, indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in the absence of any insult. Unexpectedly, activated mutant microglia shared part of their transcriptional signature with aged human microglia. Furthermore, transcriptome profiles of the entire telencephali isolated from young Grn-deficient animals showed remarkable similarities with the profiles of the telencephali isolated from aged wildtype animals. Additionally, 50% of differentially regulated genes during aging were regulated in the telencephalon of young Grn-deficient animals compared to their wildtype littermates. Importantly, the telencephalon transcriptome in young Grn-deficent animals changed only mildly with aging, further suggesting premature aging of Grn-deficient brain. Indeed, Grn loss led to decreased neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, and to shortening of telomeres at young ages, to an extent comparable to that observed during aging. Altogether, our data demonstrate a role of Grn in regulating aging kinetics in the zebrafish telencephalon, thus providing a valuable tool for the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat age-associated pathologies.	2020-02-03	2024-03-06 20:01:18	2024-03-06T20:01:18Z		350		2	9		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32028681 PMCID: PMC7072227					Aging; Aging, Premature; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Gene Expression Profiling; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Kinetics; Microglia; Mutation; Neurogenesis; Oligodendroglia; Phenotype; Stem Cells; Telencephalon; Telomere; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; aging; granulin; microglia; neurogenesis

Macrophages directly contribute collagen to scar formation during zebrafish heart regeneration and mouse heart repair	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-019-14263-2		Canonical roles for macrophages in mediating the fibrotic response after a heart attack include extracellular matrix turnover and activation of cardiac fibroblasts to initiate collagen deposition. Here we reveal that macrophages directly contribute collagen to the forming post-injury scar. Unbiased transcriptomics shows an upregulation of collagens in both zebrafish and mouse macrophages following heart injury. Adoptive transfer of macrophages, from either collagen-tagged zebrafish or adult mouse GFPtpz-collagen donors, enhances scar formation via cell autonomous production of collagen. In zebrafish, the majority of tagged collagen localises proximal to the injury, within the overlying epicardial region, suggesting a possible distinction between macrophage-deposited collagen and that predominantly laid-down by myofibroblasts. Macrophage-specific targeting of col4a3bpa and cognate col4a1 in zebrafish significantly reduces scarring in cryoinjured hosts. Our findings contrast with the current model of scarring, whereby collagen deposition is exclusively attributed to myofibroblasts, and implicate macrophages as direct contributors to fibrosis during heart repair.	2020-01-30	2024-03-06 20:01:18	2024-03-06T20:01:18Z		600		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32001677 PMCID: PMC6992796					Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Cicatrix; Collagen; Embryo, Mammalian; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Heart; Macrophages; Mice; Monocytes; RNA, Messenger; Spleen; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the detailed roles of miRNAs in cold acclimation in fish are still unclear. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs from 6 small RNA libraries from the zebrafish embryonic fibroblast ZF4 cells under control (28°C, 30 days) and cold-acclimation (18°C, 30 days) conditions. A total of 414 miRNAs, 349 known and 65 novel, were identified. Among those miRNAs, 24 (19 known and 5 novel) were up-regulated, and 23 (9 known and 14 novel) were down-regulated in cold acclimated cells. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses indicated that the target genes of known differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNA) are involved in cold acclimation by regulation of phosphorylation, cell junction, intracellular signal transduction, ECM-receptor interaction and so on. Moreover, both miR-100-3p inhibitor and miR-16b mimics could protect ZF4 cells under cold stress, indicating the involvement of miRNA in cold acclimation. Further study showed that miR-100-3p and miR-16b could regulate inversely the expression of their target gene (atad5a, cyp2ae1, lamp1, rilp, atxn7, tnika, btbd9), and that overexpression of miR-100-3p disturbed the early embryonic development of zebrafish. In summary, the present data show that miRNAs are closely involved in cold acclimation in zebrafish ZF4 cells and provide information for further understanding of the roles of miRNAs in cold acclimation in fish.	2020	2024-03-06 20:01:18	2024-03-06T20:01:18Z		e0226905		1	15		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31923196 PMCID: PMC6953832					Acclimatization; Animals; Cell Line; Cold Temperature; Gene Expression Profiling; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; MicroRNAs; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

However, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) could direct juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation to male and even induce ovary-to-testis reversal in adult zebrafish. RESULTS: In order to determine the transcriptomic changes of sex differentiation in juvenile zebrafish and early sex-reversal in adult zebrafish, we sequenced the transcriptomes of juvenile and adult zebrafish treated with AI exemestane (EM) for 32 days, when juvenile zebrafish sex differentiation finished. EM treatment in females up-regulated the expression of genes involved in estrogen metabolic process, female gamete generation and oogenesis, including gsdf, macf1a and paqr5a, while down-regulated the expression of vitellogenin (vtg) genes, including vtg6, vtg2, vtg4, and vtg7 due to the lower level of Estradiol (E2). Furthermore, EM-juveniles showed up-regulation in genes related to cell death and apoptosis, such as bcl2l16 and anax1c, while the control-juveniles exhibited up-regulation of genes involved in positive regulation of reproductive process and oocyte differentiation such as zar1 and zpcx. Moreover, EM-females showed higher enrichment than control females in genes involved in VEGF signaling pathway, glycosaminoglycan degradation, hedgehog signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows anti-masculinization in EM-treated adult females but not in EM-treated juveniles. This may be responsible for the lower sex plasticity in adults than juveniles.	2020-01-07	2024-03-06 20:01:17	2024-03-06T20:01:17Z		22		1	21		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31910818 PMCID: PMC6947999					Adult; Androstadienes; Animals; Aromatase Inhibitors; Aromatase inhibitor; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hedgehog Proteins; Male; RNA-Seq; Reproduction; Sex Differentiation; Sex differentiation; Sex reversal; Signal Transduction; Vitellogenesis; Vitellogenins; Zebrafish

However, the sub-lethal consequences induced by these absorbed radiological doses remain understudied and the long-term biological impacts largely unknown. We assessed the biological effects of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) on embryonic development by exposing zebrafish embryo from fertilization and up to 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf) at dose rates of 0.5 mGy/h, 5 mGy/h and 50 mGy/h, thereby encompassing the field of low dose rates defined at 6 mGy/h. Chronic exposure to IR altered larval behaviour in a light-dark locomotor test and affected cardiac activity at a dose rate as low as 0.5 mGy/h. The multi-omics analysis of transcriptome, proteome and transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of the deregulated genes, collectively points towards perturbations of neurogenesis, muscle development, and retinoic acid (RA) signaling after chronic exposure to IR. Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the impaired expression of the transcription factors her4.4 in the central nervous system and myogenin in the developing muscles of exposed embryos. At the organ level, the assessment of muscle histology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated myofibers disruption and altered neuromuscular junctions in exposed larvae at 5 mGy/h and 50 mGy/h. The integration of these multi-level data demonstrates that chronic exposure to low dose rates of IR has an impact on neuronal and muscle progenitor cells, that could lead to motility defects in free swimming larvae at 120 hpf. The mechanistic understanding of these effects allows us to propose a model where deregulation of RA signaling by chronic exposure to IR has pleiotropic effects on neurogenesis and muscle development.	2019-12-27	2024-03-06 20:01:17	2024-03-06T20:01:17Z		20241		1	9		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31882844 PMCID: PMC6934629					Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Embryonic Development; Larva; Muscle Development; Muscles; Nervous System; Radiation, Ionizing; Systems Biology; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Tretinoin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the cellular identity and the biological properties of adult newborn neurons are elusive for most brain areas. Here, we have used short-term lineage tracing of radial glia progeny to prospectively isolate newborn neurons from the her4.1+ radial glia lineage in the homeostatic adult forebrain. Transcriptome analysis of radial glia, newborn neurons and mature neurons using single cell sequencing identified distinct transcriptional profiles, including novel markers for each population. Specifically, we detected two separate newborn neuron types, which showed diversity of cell fate commitment and location. Further analyses showed that these cell types are homologous to neurogenic cells in the mammalian brain, identified neurogenic commitment in proliferating radial glia and indicated that glutamatergic projection neurons are generated in the adult zebrafish telencephalon. Thus, we prospectively isolated adult newborn neurons from the adult zebrafish forebrain, identified markers for newborn and mature neurons in the adult brain, and revealed intrinsic heterogeneity among adult newborn neurons and their homology with mammalian adult neurogenic cell types.	2020-01-09	2024-03-06 20:01:17	2024-03-06T20:01:17Z		dev185595		1	147		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31908317 PMCID: PMC6983714					Adult neurogenesis; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Animals, Newborn; Brain; Cell Lineage; Diencephalon; Ependymoglial Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Mice; Neural stem cell; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Radial glia; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single cell sequencing; Single-Cell Analysis; Telencephalon; Zebrafish

Studies in zebrafish have resulted in a model in which preexisting cardiomyocytes dedifferentiate and reinitiate proliferation to replace the lost myocardium. To identify which processes occur in proliferating cardiomyocytes we have used a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach. We uncovered that proliferating border zone cardiomyocytes have very distinct transcriptomes compared to the nonproliferating remote cardiomyocytes and that they resemble embryonic cardiomyocytes. Moreover, these cells have reduced expression of mitochondrial genes and reduced mitochondrial activity, while glycolysis gene expression and glucose uptake are increased, indicative for metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we find that the metabolic reprogramming of border zone cardiomyocytes is induced by Nrg1/ErbB2 signaling and is important for their proliferation. This mechanism is conserved in murine hearts in which cardiomyocyte proliferation is induced by activating ErbB2 signaling. Together these results demonstrate that glycolysis regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration.	2019-12-23	2024-03-06 20:01:16	2024-03-06T20:01:16Z		e50163			8		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31868166 PMCID: PMC7000220					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; Cellular Reprogramming; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, erbB-2; Glycolysis; Heart; Hexokinase; Male; Mice; Models, Animal; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Neuregulin-1; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; heart; metabolism; mouse; neuregulin; regeneration; regenerative medicine; stem cells; zebrafish

Here we characterize microglia morphology and transcriptional programs across ten species spanning more than 450 million years of evolution. We find that microglia express a conserved core gene program of orthologous genes from rodents to humans, including ligands and receptors associated with interactions between glia and neurons. In most species, microglia show a single dominant transcriptional state, whereas human microglia display significant heterogeneity. In addition, we observed notable differences in several gene modules of rodents compared with primate microglia, including complement, phagocytic, and susceptibility genes to neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Our study provides an essential resource of conserved and divergent microglia pathways across evolution, with important implications for future development of microglia-based therapies in humans.	2019-12-12	2024-03-06 20:01:15	2024-03-06T20:01:15Z		1609-1622.e16		7	179		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31835035					Animals; Chickens; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Microglia; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Primates; Reptiles; Rodentia; Sheep; Single-Cell Analysis; Swine; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; immunology; microglia; neurodegeneration; single-cell RNA-seq; systems biology

Evolutionarily novel genes are expressed in transgenic fish tumors and their orthologs are involved in development of progressive traits in humans	Infectious Agents and Cancer		1750-9378	10.1186/s13027-019-0262-5		ABSTRACT: Earlier we suggested a new hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of hereditary tumors (Kozlov, Evolution by tumor Neofunctionalization, 2014), and described a new class of genes - tumor specifically expressed, evolutionarily novel (TSEEN) genes - that are predicted by this hypothesis (Kozlov, Infect Agents Cancer 11:34, 2016). In this paper we studied evolutionarily novel genes expressed in fish tumors after regression, as a model of evolving organs. As evolutionarily novel genes may not yet have organismal functions, we studied the acquisition of new gene functions by comparing fish evolutionarily novel genes with their human orthologs. We found that many genes involved in development of progressive traits in humans (lung, mammary gland, placenta, ventricular septum, etc.) originated in fish and are expressed in fish tumors and tumors after regression. These findings support a possible evolutionary role of hereditary tumors, and in particular the hypothesis of evolution by tumor neofunctionalization. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Earlier we described a new class of genes that are tumor-specifically expressed and evolutionarily novel (TSEEN). As the functions of TSEEN genes are often uncertain, we decided to study TSEEN genes of fishes so that we could trace the appearance of their new functions in higher vertebrates. We found that many human genes which are involved in development of progressive traits (placenta development, mammary gland and lung development etc.,) originated in fishes and are expressed in fish tumors.	2019	2024-03-06 20:01:14	2024-03-06T20:01:14Z		46			14		Infect Agent Cancer								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31827597 PMCID: PMC6896781					Cancer; Evolution; Evolutionarily novel; Gene expression; Tumor specific expression

Here we describe the identification of the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian IL-7 based on chromosomal localization, deduced protein sequence, and expression patterns. To examine the biological role of il7 in teleosts, we generated an il7 allele lacking most of its coding exons using CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis. il7-deficient animals are viable and exhibit no obvious signs of immune disorder. With respect to intrathymic T cell development, il7 deficiency is associated with only a mild reduction of thymocyte numbers, contrasting with a more pronounced impairment of T cell development in il7r-deficient fish. Genetic interaction studies between il7 and il7r mutants, and il7 and crlf2(tslpr) mutants suggest the contribution of additional, as-yet unidentified cytokines to intrathymic T cell development. Such activities were also ascertained for other cytokines, such as il2 and il15, collectively indicating that in contrast to the situation in mammals, T cell development in the thymus of teleosts is driven by a degenerate multicomponent network of γc cytokines; this explains why deficiencies of single components have little detrimental effect. In contrast, the dependence on a single cytokine in the mammalian thymus has catastrophic consequences in cases of congenital deficiencies in genes affecting the IL-7 signaling pathway. We speculate that the transition from a degenerate to a nonredundant cytokine network supporting intrathymic T cell development emerged as a consequence of repurposing evolutionarily ancient constitutive cytokine pathways for regulatory functions in the mammalian peripheral immune system.	2019-12-26	2024-03-06 20:01:14	2024-03-06T20:01:14Z		26759-26767		52	116		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31822609 PMCID: PMC6936713					cytokine signaling; evolution; network structure; thymus; zebrafish

The underlying reasons for this dramatic shift are mostly unknown. Using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model of Shigella infection, we discover that S. sonnei is more virulent than S. flexneri in vivo. Whole animal dual-RNAseq and testing of bacterial mutants suggest that S. sonnei virulence depends on its O-antigen oligosaccharide (which is unique among Shigella species). We show in vivo using zebrafish and ex vivo using human neutrophils that S. sonnei O-antigen can mediate neutrophil tolerance. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that O-antigen enables S. sonnei to resist phagolysosome acidification and promotes neutrophil cell death. Chemical inhibition or promotion of phagolysosome maturation respectively decreases and increases neutrophil control of S. sonnei and zebrafish survival. Strikingly, larvae primed with a sublethal dose of S. sonnei are protected against a secondary lethal dose of S. sonnei in an O-antigen-dependent manner, indicating that exposure to O-antigen can train the innate immune system against S. sonnei. Collectively, these findings reveal O-antigen as an important therapeutic target against bacillary dysentery, and may explain the rapidly increasing S. sonnei burden in developing countries.	2019-12	2024-03-06 20:01:14	2024-03-06T20:01:14Z		e1008006		12	15		PLoS Pathog								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31830135 PMCID: PMC6980646					Animals; Dysentery, Bacillary; Humans; Neutrophils; O Antigens; Shigella sonnei; Virulence; Zebrafish

Previous studies have identified some genetic risk factors, such as hepatitis B virus X antigens, overexpression of SRC oncogene, and mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene; however, the synergism between diet and genetic risk factors is still unclear. To investigate the synergism between diet and genetic risk factors in hepatocarcinogenesis, we used zebrafish with four genetic backgrounds and overfeeding or high-fat-diet-induced obesity with an omics-based expression of genes and histopathological changes. The results show that overfeeding and high-fat diet can induce obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in wild-type fish. In HBx, Src (p53-) triple transgenic zebrafish, diet-induced obesity accelerated HCC formation at five months of age and increased the cancer incidence threefold. We developed a global omics data analysis method to investigate genes, pathways, and biological systems based on microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS, RNA-seq) omics data of zebrafish with four diet and genetic risk factors. The results show that two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) systems, metabolism and genetic information processing, as well as the pathways of fatty acid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis, are activated during hepatocarcinogenesis. This study provides a systematic view of the synergism between genetic and diet factors in the dynamic liver cancer formation process, and indicate that overfeeding or a high-fat diet and the risk genes have a synergistic effect in causing liver cancer by affecting fatty acid metabolism and ribosome biogenesis.	2019-11-28	2024-03-06 20:01:13	2024-03-06T20:01:13Z		1899		12	11		Cancers (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31795276 PMCID: PMC6966430					hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); obesity

TGF-β Signaling Promotes Tissue Formation during Cardiac Valve Regeneration in Adult Zebrafish	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2019.10.027		Cardiac valve disease can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and is thus a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Its main treatment is valve replacement, which is currently greatly limited by the poor recellularization and tissue formation potential of the implanted valves. As we still lack suitable animal models to identify modulators of these processes, here we used adult zebrafish and found that, upon valve decellularization, they initiate a rapid regenerative program that leads to the formation of new functional valves. After injury, endothelial and kidney marrow-derived cells undergo cell cycle re-entry and differentiate into new extracellular matrix-secreting valve cells. The TGF-β signaling pathway promotes the regenerative process by enhancing progenitor cell proliferation as well as valve cell differentiation. These findings reveal a key role for TGF-β signaling in cardiac valve regeneration and establish the zebrafish as a model to identify and test factors promoting cardiac valve recellularization and growth.	2020-01-06	2024-03-06 20:01:13	2024-03-06T20:01:13Z		9-20.e7		1	52		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31786069					Animals; Cell Cycle; Cell Differentiation; Endothelium; Extracellular Matrix; Heart Valves; Kidney; Models, Animal; Regeneration; Tissue Engineering; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Zebrafish; atrio-ventricular; cell ablation; cell tracing; cell transplantation; endothelium; extracellular matrix; laser capture microdissection; valve endothelial cells; valve interstitial cells; whole kidney marrow																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

Here, we utilized Microwell-seq to analyze more than 250,000 single cells covering major zebrafish cell types and constructed a systematic zebrafish cell landscape. We revealed single-cell compositions for 18 zebrafish tissue types covering both embryo and adult stages. Single-cell mapping of caudal fin regeneration revealed a unique characteristic of blastema population and key genetic regulation involved in zebrafish tissue repair.

X9PBI6XW	journalArticle	2021	Lin, Yi-Fan; Sam, Jessica; Evans, Todd	Sirt1 promotes tissue regeneration in zebrafish through regulating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response	iScience		2589-0042	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103118		The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is an organellar stress signaling pathway that functions to detect and restore disruption of mitochondrial proteostasis. The UPRmt is involved in a wide range of physiological and disease conditions, including aging, stem cell maintenance, innate immunity, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Here we report that the UPRmt is integral to zebrafish fin regeneration. Taking advantage of a novel zebrafish UPRmt reporter, we observed that UPRmt activation occurs in regenerating fin tissue shortly after injury. Through chemical and genetic approaches, we discovered that the Sirt1-UPRmt pathway, best known for its role in promoting lifespan extension, is crucial for fin regeneration. The metabolism of NAD+ is an important contributor to Sirt1 activity in this context. We propose that Sirt1 activation induces mitochondrial biogenesis in injured fin tissue, which leads to UPRmt activation and promotes tissue regeneration.	2021-10-22	2024-03-06 20:14:19	2024-03-06T20:14:19Z		103118		10	24		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34622167 PMCID: PMC8479786					Cell biology; Developmental biology; Molecular biology

Nontrivial classical genetic and transcriptomic approaches have revealed essential molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory circuits that drive neural crest-derived cell fate decisions. However, how the epigenetic landscape contributes to pigment cell differentiation, especially in the context of iridophore cell fate, is poorly understood. RESULTS: We chart the global changes in the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, during neural crest differentiation into melanophores and iridophores to identify epigenetic determinants shaping cell type-specific gene expression. Motif enrichment in the epigenetically dynamic regions reveals putative transcription factors that might be responsible for driving pigment cell identity. Through this effort, in the relatively uncharacterized iridophores, we validate alx4a as a necessary and sufficient transcription factor for iridophore differentiation and present evidence on alx4a's potential regulatory role in guanine synthesis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Pigment cell fate is marked by substantial DNA demethylation events coupled with dynamic chromatin accessibility to potentiate gene regulation through cis-regulatory control. Here, we provide a multi-omic resource for neural crest differentiation into melanophores and iridophores. This work led to the discovery and validation of iridophore-specific alx4a transcription factor.	2021-10-04	2024-03-06 20:14:19	2024-03-06T20:14:19Z		282		1	22		Genome Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34607603 PMCID: PMC8489059					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Chromatin; Chromatophores; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Melanophores; Neural Crest; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In situ and transcriptomic identification of microglia in synapse-rich regions of the developing zebrafish brain	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-021-26206-x		Microglia are brain resident macrophages that play vital roles in central nervous system (CNS) development, homeostasis, and pathology. Microglia both remodel synapses and engulf apoptotic cell corpses during development, but whether unique molecular programs regulate these distinct phagocytic functions is unknown. Here we identify a molecularly distinct microglial subset in the synapse rich regions of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain. We found that ramified microglia increased in synaptic regions of the midbrain and hindbrain between 7 and 28 days post fertilization. In contrast, microglia in the optic tectum were ameboid and clustered around neurogenic zones. Using single-cell mRNA sequencing combined with metadata from regional bulk sequencing, we identified synaptic-region associated microglia (SAMs) that were highly enriched in the hindbrain and expressed multiple candidate synapse modulating genes, including genes in the complement pathway. In contrast, neurogenic associated microglia (NAMs) were enriched in the optic tectum, had active cathepsin activity, and preferentially engulfed neuronal corpses. These data reveal that molecularly distinct phagocytic programs mediate synaptic remodeling and cell engulfment, and establish the zebrafish hindbrain as a model for investigating microglial-synapse interactions.	2021-10-08	2024-03-06 20:14:19	2024-03-06T20:14:19Z		5916		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34625548 PMCID: PMC8501082					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte; Cathepsin B; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Mesencephalon; Microglia; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Phagocytosis; Rhombencephalon; Single-Cell Analysis; Superior Colliculi; Synapses; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Yet, the mechanistic basis for HSC development remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a zebrafish smu471 mutant with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) defects and found that sart3 was the causative gene. RNA expression profiling of the sart3smu471 mutant revealed spliceosome and p53 signaling pathway to be the most significantly enriched pathways in the sart3smu471 mutant. Knock down of p53 rescued HSPC development in the sart3smu471 mutant. Interestingly, the p53 inhibitor, mdm4, had undergone an alternative splicing event in the mutant. Restoration of mdm4 partially rescued HSPC deficiency. Thus, our data suggest that HSPC proliferation and maintenance require sart3 to ensure the correct splicing and expression of mdm4, so that the p53 pathway is properly inhibited to prevent definitive hematopoiesis failure. This study expands our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that impact HSPC development and sheds light on the mechanistic basis and potential therapeutic use of sart3 in spliceosome-mdm4-p53 related disorders.	2021-10-05	2024-03-06 20:14:19	2024-03-06T20:14:19Z		906		10	12		Cell Death Dis								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34611130 PMCID: PMC8492694					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Apoptosis; Base Sequence; Cell Proliferation; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Models, Biological; Mutation; RNA Splicing Factors; Signal Transduction; Spliceosomes; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The SAN consists of a specialized pacemaker cell population that has the potential to generate electrical impulses. Although the SAN pacemaker has been extensively studied in mammalian and teleost models, including the zebrafish, their molecular nature remains inadequately comprehended. RESULTS: To characterize the molecular profile of the zebrafish sinoatrial ring (SAR) and elucidate the mechanism of pacemaker function, we utilized the transgenic line sqet33mi59BEt to isolate cells of the SAR of developing zebrafish embryos and profiled their transcriptome. Our analyses identified novel candidate genes and well-known conserved signaling pathways involved in pacemaker development. We show that, compared to the rest of the heart, the zebrafish SAR overexpresses several mammalian SAN pacemaker signature genes, which include hcn4 as well as those encoding calcium- and potassium-gated channels. Moreover, genes encoding components of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as members of the Tbx family, which have previously been implicated in pacemaker development, were also overexpressed in the SAR. Among SAR-overexpressed genes, 24 had human homologues implicated in 104 different ClinVar phenotype entries related to various forms of congenital heart diseases, which suggest the relevance of our transcriptomics resource to studying human heart conditions. Finally, functional analyses of three SAR-overexpressed genes, pard6a, prom2, and atp1a1a.2, uncovered their novel role in heart development and physiology. CONCLUSION: Our results established conserved aspects between zebrafish and mammalian pacemaker function and revealed novel factors implicated in maintaining cardiac rhythm. The transcriptome data generated in this study represents a unique and valuable resource for the study of pacemaker function and associated heart diseases.	2021-10-02	2024-03-06 20:14:18	2024-03-06T20:14:18Z		715		1	22		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34600492 PMCID: PMC8487553					Animals; Cardiac conduction system; Heart Rate; Humans; Pacemaker; RNA-seq; Sinoatrial Node; Sinoatrial node; Sinoatrial ring; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

The lack of genetic tractability/interventions and reliance on secondary validation using other non-specific compounds frequently complicate the earmarking of individual binders as functionally- or phenotypically-sufficient pathway regulators. Using a redox-targeting approach to interrogate how on-target binding of pleiotropic electrophiles translates to a phenotypic output in vivo, we here systematically track the molecular components attributable to innate immune cell toxicity of the electrophilic-drug dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®). In a process largely independent of canonical Keap1/Nrf2-signaling, Keap1-specific modification triggers mitochondrial-targeted neutrophil/macrophage apoptosis. On-target Keap1-ligand-engagement is accompanied by dissociation of Wdr1 from Keap1 and subsequent coordination with cofilin, intercepting Bax. This phagocytic-specific cell-killing program is recapitulated by whole-animal administration of dimethyl fumarate, where individual depletions of the players identified above robustly suppress apoptosis.	2021-09-30	2024-03-06 20:14:18	2024-03-06T20:14:18Z		5736		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34593792 PMCID: PMC8484674					Actin Depolymerizing Factors; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Dimethyl Fumarate; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; Macrophages; Mice; Microfilament Proteins; Neutrophils; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is essential for wound healing, including both scar formation and regeneration. However, targeting TGFβ may affect other physiological mechanisms, owing its pleiotropic nature. The regulation of various cellular activities by TGFβ relies on its interaction with other pathways including Notch. Here, we explore the interplay of TGFβ with Notch and how this regulates MC response to injury in zebrafish and mice. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize potential similarities between murine and human MCs during chronic reactive gliosis. METHODS: Focal damage to photoreceptors was induced with a 532 nm diode laser in TgBAC (gfap:gfap-GFP) zebrafish (ZF) and B6-Tg (Rlbp1-GFP) mice. Transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were employed for a comparative analysis of MC response to laser-induced injury between ZF and mouse. The laser-induced injury was paired with pharmacological treatments to inhibit either Notch (DAPT) or TGFβ (Pirfenidone) or TGFβ/Notch interplay (SIS3). To determine if the murine laser-induced injury model translates to the human system, we compared the ensuing MC response to human donors with early retinal degeneration. RESULTS: Investigations into injury-induced changes in murine MCs revealed TGFβ/Notch interplay during reactive gliosis. We found that TGFβ1/2 and Notch1/2 interact via Smad3 to reprogram murine MCs towards an epithelial lineage and ultimately to form a glial scar. Similar to what we observed in mice, we confirmed the epithelial phenotype of human Müller cells during gliotic response. CONCLUSION: The study indicates a pivotal role for TGFβ/Notch interplay in tuning MC stemness during injury response and provides novel insights into the remodeling mechanism during retinal degenerative diseases.	2021-09-30	2024-03-06 20:14:18	2024-03-06T20:14:18Z		69		1	16		Mol Neurodegener								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34593012 PMCID: PMC8482586					Animals; Ependymoglial Cells; Gliosis; Laser injury; Mammals; Mice; Müller cells; Notch pathway; Retinal degeneration; Retinal regeneration; Signal Transduction; Smad3; TGFβ signaling; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Vertebrates; Zebrafish

To elucidate the mechanism underlying AVC development and function, we utilized transgenic zebrafish line sqet31Et expressing EGFP in the AVC to isolate this cell population and profile its transcriptome at 48 and 72 hpf. The zebrafish AVC transcriptome exhibits hallmarks of mammalian AV node, including the expression of genes implicated in its development and those encoding connexins forming low conductance gap junctions. Transcriptome analysis uncovered protein-coding and noncoding transcripts enriched in AVC, which have not been previously associated with this structure, as well as dynamic expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers and components of TGF-β, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways likely reflecting ongoing AVC and valve development. Using transgenic line Tg(myl7:mermaid) encoding voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein, we show that abolishing the pacemaker-containing sinoatrial ring (SAR) through Isl1 loss of function resulted in spontaneous activation in the AVC region, suggesting that it possesses inherent automaticity although insufficient to replace the SAR. The SAR and AVC transcriptomes express partially overlapping species of ion channels and gap junction proteins, reflecting their distinct roles. Besides identifying conserved aspects between zebrafish and mammalian conduction systems, our results established molecular hallmarks of the developing AVC which underlies its role in structural and electrophysiological separation between heart chambers. This data constitutes a valuable resource for studying AVC development and function, and identification of novel candidate genes implicated in these processes.	2021-10	2024-03-06 20:14:17	2024-03-06T20:14:17Z		6669-6687		19-20	78		Cell Mol Life Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34557935 PMCID: PMC8558220					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Atrioventricular canal; Atrioventricular node; Cardiac pacemaker; Cardiac valve; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genome; Genomics; Heart Septal Defects; Heart Valves; Myocardium; Organogenesis; Pacemaker, Artificial; RNA-seq; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Maintenance of tissue homeostasis by balancing cell proliferation, cell size, and cell extrusion ensures epidermal integrity. Although the mechanisms of cell extrusion are better understood, how epithelial cells that round up under developmental or perturbed genetic conditions are reintegrated in the epithelium to maintain homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we performed live imaging in zebrafish embryos to show that epidermal cells that round up due to membrane homeostasis defects in the absence of goosepimples/myosinVb (myoVb) function, are reintegrated into the epithelium. Transcriptome analysis and genetic interaction studies suggest that the transcription factor Grainyhead-like 3 (Grhl3) induces the retention of rounded cells by regulating E-cadherin levels. Moreover, Grhl3 facilitates the survival of MyoVb deficient embryos by regulating cell adhesion, cell retention, and epidermal architecture. Our analyses have unraveled a mechanism of retention of rounded cells and its importance in epithelial homeostasis.	2021-09	2024-03-06 20:14:17	2024-03-06T20:14:17Z		e1009823		9	17		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34570762 PMCID: PMC8496789					Animals; Endocytosis; Epidermal Cells; Mutation; Stress, Physiological; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Despite its importance, our understanding of the molecular players that govern mammalian sperm-egg interaction is incomplete, partly because many of the essential factors found in nonmammalian species do not have obvious mammalian homologs. We have recently identified the lymphocyte antigen-6 (Ly6)/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) protein Bouncer as an essential fertilization factor in zebrafish [S. Herberg, K. R. Gert, A. Schleiffer, A. Pauli, Science 361, 1029-1033 (2018)]. Here, we show that Bouncer's homolog in mammals, Sperm Acrosome Associated 4 (SPACA4), is also required for efficient fertilization in mice. In contrast to fish, in which Bouncer is expressed specifically in the egg, SPACA4 is expressed exclusively in the sperm. Male knockout mice are severely subfertile, and sperm lacking SPACA4 fail to fertilize wild-type eggs in vitro. Interestingly, removal of the zona pellucida rescues the fertilization defect of Spaca4-deficient sperm in vitro, indicating that SPACA4 is not required for the interaction of sperm and the oolemma but rather of sperm and the zona pellucida. Our work identifies SPACA4 as an important sperm protein necessary for zona pellucida penetration during mammalian fertilization.	2021-09-28	2024-03-06 20:14:16	2024-03-06T20:14:16Z		e2108777118		39	118		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34556579 PMCID: PMC8488580					Acrosome; Animals; Antigens, Ly; Female; Fertilization; Infertility, Male; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Zona Pellucida; fertilization; mouse; sperm–egg interaction; zona pellucida

Cooperation between melanoma cell states promotes metastasis through heterotypic cluster formation	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2021.08.018		Melanomas can have multiple coexisting cell states, including proliferative (PRO) versus invasive (INV) subpopulations that represent a "go or grow" trade-off; however, how these populations interact is poorly understood. Using a combination of zebrafish modeling and analysis of patient samples, we show that INV and PRO cells form spatially structured heterotypic clusters and cooperate in the seeding of metastasis, maintaining cell state heterogeneity. INV cells adhere tightly to each other and form clusters with a rim of PRO cells. Intravital imaging demonstrated cooperation in which INV cells facilitate dissemination of less metastatic PRO cells. We identified the TFAP2 neural crest transcription factor as a master regulator of clustering and PRO/INV states. Isolation of clusters from patients with metastatic melanoma revealed a subset with heterotypic PRO-INV clusters. Our data suggest a framework for the co-existence of these two divergent cell populations, in which heterotypic clusters promote metastasis via cell-cell cooperation.	2021-10-25	2024-03-06 20:14:16	2024-03-06T20:14:16Z		2808-2825.e10		20	56		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34529939 PMCID: PMC8551056					Animals; Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Melanoma; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Neural Crest; TFAP2; Zebrafish; circulating tumor cell cluster; cluster; cooperation; melanoma; metastasis; zebrafish

Retinal ganglion cell survival after severe optic nerve injury is modulated by crosstalk between Jak/Stat signaling and innate immune responses in the zebrafish retina	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.199694		Visual information is transmitted from the eye to the brain along the optic nerve, a structure composed of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. The optic nerve is highly vulnerable to damage in neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs or therapies to protect RGCs from death. Zebrafish possess remarkable neuroprotective and regenerative abilities. Here, utilizing an optic nerve transection (ONT) injury and an RNA-seq-based approach, we identify genes and pathways active in RGCs that may modulate their survival. Through pharmacological perturbation, we demonstrate that Jak/Stat pathway activity is required for RGC survival after ONT. Furthermore, we show that immune responses directly contribute to RGC death after ONT; macrophages/microglia are recruited to the retina and blocking neuroinflammation or depleting these cells after ONT rescues survival of RGCs. Taken together, these data support a model in which crosstalk between macrophages/microglia and RGCs, mediated by Jak/Stat pathway activity, regulates RGC survival after optic nerve injury.	2022-04-15	2024-03-06 20:14:15	2024-03-06T20:14:15Z		dev199694		8	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34528064 PMCID: PMC8601708					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Female; Immunity, Innate; Innate immune system; Jak/Stat; Janus Kinases; Male; Neuroprotection; Optic Nerve Injuries; RGC; Retinal Ganglion Cells; STAT Transcription Factors; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, the subpopulations, distinguishing molecular features, cellular functions, and intercellular interactions of non-CMs in heart regeneration remain largely unexplored. Using the LIGER algorithm, we assemble an atlas of cell states from 61,977 individual non-CM scRNA-seq profiles isolated at multiple time points during regeneration. This analysis reveals extensive non-CM cell diversity, including multiple macrophage (MC), fibroblast (FB), and endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations with unique spatiotemporal distributions, and suggests an important role for MC in inducing the activated FB and EC subpopulations. Indeed, pharmacological perturbation of MC function compromises the induction of the unique FB and EC subpopulations. Furthermore, we developed computational algorithm Topologizer to map the topological relationships and dynamic transitions between functional states. We uncover dynamic transitions between MC functional states and identify factors involved in mRNA processing and transcriptional regulation associated with the transition. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of non-CMs during cardiac regeneration provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of this process.	2021-11-04	2024-03-06 20:14:15	2024-03-06T20:14:15Z		e52901		11	22		EMBO Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34523214 PMCID: PMC8567231					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Endothelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Heart; Myocytes, Cardiac; Topologizer; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; heart regeneration; non-myocytes; scRNA-Seq; zebrafish

The Warburg effect is necessary to promote glycosylation in the blastema during zebrafish tail regeneration	NPJ Regenerative medicine		2057-3995	10.1038/s41536-021-00163-x		Throughout their lifetime, fish maintain a high capacity for regenerating complex tissues after injury. We utilized a larval tail regeneration assay in the zebrafish Danio rerio, which serves as an ideal model of appendage regeneration due to its easy manipulation, relatively simple mixture of cell types, and superior imaging properties. Regeneration of the embryonic zebrafish tail requires development of a blastema, a mass of dedifferentiated cells capable of replacing lost tissue, a crucial step in all known examples of appendage regeneration. Using this model, we show that tail amputation triggers an obligate metabolic shift to promote glucose metabolism during early regeneration similar to the Warburg effect observed in tumor forming cells. Inhibition of glucose metabolism did not affect the overall health of the embryo but completely blocked the tail from regenerating after amputation due to the failure to form a functional blastema. We performed a time series of single-cell RNA sequencing on regenerating tails with and without inhibition of glucose metabolism. We demonstrated that metabolic reprogramming is required for sustained TGF-β signaling and blocking glucose metabolism largely mimicked inhibition of TGF-β receptors, both resulting in an aberrant blastema. Finally, we showed using genetic ablation of three possible metabolic pathways for glucose, that metabolic reprogramming is required to provide glucose specifically to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway while neither glycolysis nor the pentose phosphate pathway were necessary for regeneration.	2021-09-13	2024-03-06 20:14:15	2024-03-06T20:14:15Z		55		1	6		NPJ Regen Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34518542 PMCID: PMC8437957

CTCF knockout in zebrafish induces alterations in regulatory landscapes and developmental gene expression	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-021-25604-5		Coordinated chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters are critical for gene regulation. The architectural protein CTCF mediates chromatin looping and is enriched at the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs), which are sub-megabase chromatin structures. In vitro CTCF depletion leads to a loss of TADs but has only limited effects over gene expression, challenging the concept that CTCF-mediated chromatin structures are a fundamental requirement for gene regulation. However, how CTCF and a perturbed chromatin structure impacts gene expression during development remains poorly understood. Here we link the loss of CTCF and gene regulation during patterning and organogenesis in a ctcf knockout zebrafish model. CTCF absence leads to loss of chromatin structure and affects the expression of thousands of genes, including many developmental regulators. Our results demonstrate the essential role of CTCF in providing the structural context for enhancer-promoter interactions, thus regulating developmental genes.	2021-09-13	2024-03-06 20:14:14	2024-03-06T20:14:14Z		5415		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34518536 PMCID: PMC8438036					Animals; Body Patterning; CCCTC-Binding Factor; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Chromatin; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockout Techniques; Organogenesis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA-Seq; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In contrast, species like zebrafish can regenerate damaged tissues without excessive fibrosis. However, whether specific signaling pathways can both limit fibrosis and promote regeneration is unclear. Here, we show that interleukin-11 (Il-11)/Stat3 signaling has such a dual function. Zebrafish lacking Il-11 receptor function display severely compromised heart, fin, and scale regeneration. Deep phenotyping and transcriptional analysis of adult hearts and fins show that Il-11 signaling drives cellular reprogramming to orchestrate global and tissue-specific regenerative programs and broadly antagonizes hallmarks of adult mammalian scarring. Mechanistically, our data indicate that IL-11 signaling in endothelial cells antagonizes profibrotic transforming growth factor–β signaling and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, limiting scarring and promoting cardiomyocyte repopulation, after injury. Overall, our findings position damage-induced Il-11/Stat3 signaling in a key role limiting fibrosis and promoting regeneration, revealing novel targets for regenerative therapies.	2021-09-10	2024-03-06 20:14:14	2024-03-06T20:14:14Z		eabg6497		37	7		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34516874 PMCID: PMC8442930

Gene co-expression network analysis in zebrafish reveals chemical class specific modules	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-021-07940-4		BACKGROUND: Zebrafish is a popular animal model used for high-throughput screening of chemical hazards, however, investigations of transcriptomic mechanisms of toxicity are still needed. Here, our goal was to identify genes and biological pathways that Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor 2 (AHR2) Activators and flame retardant chemicals (FRCs) alter in developing zebrafish. Taking advantage of a compendium of phenotypically-anchored RNA sequencing data collected from 48-h post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish, we inferred a co-expression network that grouped genes based on their transcriptional response. RESULTS: Genes responding to the FRCs and AHR2 Activators localized to distinct regions of the network, with FRCs inducing a broader response related to neurobehavior. AHR2 Activators centered in one region related to chemical stress responses. We also discovered several highly co-expressed genes in this module, including cyp1a, and we subsequently show that these genes are definitively within the AHR2 signaling pathway. Systematic removal of the two chemical types from the data, and analysis of network changes identified neurogenesis associated with FRCs, and regulation of vascular development associated with both chemical classes. We also identified highly connected genes responding specifically to each class that are potential biomarkers of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we created the first zebrafish chemical-specific gene co-expression network illuminating how chemicals alter the transcriptome relative to each other. In addition to our conclusions regarding FRCs and AHR2 Activators, our network can be leveraged by other studies investigating chemical mechanisms of toxicity.	2021-09-13	2024-03-06 20:14:14	2024-03-06T20:14:14Z		658		1	22		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34517816 PMCID: PMC8438978					Animals; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Base Sequence; Development; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Flame retardant chemicals; Gene co-expression; Network; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Runx1-null mouse embryos lack definitive hematopoiesis and die in mid-gestation. However, although zebrafish embryos with a runx1 W84X mutation have defects in early definitive hematopoiesis, some runx1W84X/W84X embryos can develop to fertile adults with blood cells of multilineages, raising the possibility that HSCs can emerge without RUNX1. Here, using 3 new zebrafish runx1-/- lines, we uncovered the compensatory mechanism for runx1-independent hematopoiesis. We show that, in the absence of a functional runx1, a cd41-green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ population of hematopoietic precursors still emerge from the hemogenic endothelium and can colonize the hematopoietic tissues of the mutant embryos. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the cd41-GFP+ cells identified a set of runx1-/--specific signature genes during hematopoiesis. Significantly, gata2b, which normally acts upstream of runx1 for the generation of HSCs, was increased in the cd41-GFP+ cells in runx1-/- embryos. Interestingly, genetic inactivation of both gata2b and its paralog gata2a did not affect hematopoiesis. However, knocking out runx1 and any 3 of the 4 alleles of gata2a and gata2b abolished definitive hematopoiesis. Gata2 expression was also upregulated in hematopoietic cells in Runx1-/- mice, suggesting the compensatory mechanism is conserved. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and GATA2 serve redundant roles for HSC production, acting as each other's safeguard.	2021-12-14	2024-03-06 20:14:13	2024-03-06T20:14:13Z		4949-4962		23	5		Blood Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34492681 PMCID: PMC9153008					Animals; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mice; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Partitioning of gene expression among zebrafish photoreceptor subtypes	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-021-96837-z		Vertebrate photoreceptors are categorized into two broad classes, rods and cones, responsible for dim- and bright-light vision, respectively. While many molecular features that distinguish rods and cones are known, gene expression differences among cone subtypes remain poorly understood. Teleost fishes are renowned for the diversity of their photoreceptor systems. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to profile adult photoreceptors in zebrafish, a teleost. We found that in addition to the four canonical zebrafish cone types, there exist subpopulations of green and red cones (previously shown to be located in the ventral retina) that express red-shifted opsin paralogs (opn1mw4 or opn1lw1) as well as a unique combination of cone phototransduction genes. Furthermore, the expression of many paralogous phototransduction genes is partitioned among cone subtypes, analogous to the partitioning of the phototransduction paralogs between rods and cones seen across vertebrates. The partitioned cone-gene pairs arose via the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication or later clade-specific gene duplications. We also discovered that cone subtypes express distinct transcriptional regulators, including many factors not previously implicated in photoreceptor development or differentiation. Overall, our work suggests that partitioning of paralogous gene expression via the action of differentially expressed transcriptional regulators enables diversification of cone subtypes in teleosts.	2021-08-30	2024-03-06 20:14:13	2024-03-06T20:14:13Z		17340		1	11		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34462505 PMCID: PMC8405809					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Separation; Cluster Analysis; Color Vision; Evolution, Molecular; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Techniques; Genome; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Light Signal Transduction; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; RNA-Seq; Retina; Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells; Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Fibroblast activation in the mammalian heart leads to a permanent fibrotic scar that impairs cardiac function. In other organisms, such as zebrafish, cardiac injury is followed by transient fibrosis and scar-free regeneration. The mechanisms that drive scarring versus scar-free regeneration are not well understood. Here, we show that the homeobox-containing transcription factor Prrx1b is required for scar-free regeneration of the zebrafish heart as the loss of Prrx1b results in excessive fibrosis and impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation. Through lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that Prrx1b is activated in epicardial-derived cells where it restricts TGFβ ligand expression and collagen production. Furthermore, through combined in vitro experiments in human fetal epicardial-derived cells and in vivo rescue experiments in zebrafish, we conclude that Prrx1 stimulates Nrg1 expression and promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation. Collectively, these results indicate that Prrx1 is a key transcription factor that balances fibrosis and regeneration in the injured zebrafish heart.

Single-cell imaging of T cell immunotherapy responses in vivo	The Journal of Experimental Medicine		1540-9538	10.1084/jem.20210314		T cell immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment for a subset of cancers. Yet, a major hurdle has been the lack of facile and predicative preclinical animal models that permit dynamic visualization of T cell immune responses at single-cell resolution in vivo. Here, optically clear immunocompromised zebrafish were engrafted with fluorescent-labeled human cancers along with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells, bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), and antibody peptide epitope conjugates (APECs), allowing real-time single-cell visualization of T cell-based immunotherapies in vivo. This work uncovered important differences in the kinetics of T cell infiltration, tumor cell engagement, and killing between these immunotherapies and established early endpoint analysis to predict therapy responses. We also established EGFR-targeted immunotherapies as a powerful approach to kill rhabdomyosarcoma muscle cancers, providing strong preclinical rationale for assessing a wider array of T cell immunotherapies in this disease.	2021-10-04	2024-03-06 20:14:12	2024-03-06T20:14:12Z		e20210314		10	218		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34415995 PMCID: PMC8383813					Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA-Binding Proteins; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Phthalazines; Piperazines; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Single-Cell Analysis; T-Lymphocytes; Temozolomide; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

A certain threshold of injury-derived signal must be exceeded in order to engage MG in a regenerative response (MG's injury-response threshold). Pan-retinal Notch inhibition expands the zone of injury-responsive MG at the site of focal injury, suggesting that Notch signaling regulates MG's injury-response threshold. We found that Notch signaling enhanced chromatin accessibility and gene expression at a subset of regeneration-associated genes in the uninjured retina. Two Notch effector genes, hey1 and id2b, were identified that reflect bifurcation of the Notch signaling pathway, and differentially regulate MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation of MG-derived progenitors. Furthermore, Notch signaling component gene repression in the injured retina suggests a role for Dll4, Dlb, and Notch3 in regulating Notch signaling in MG and epistasis experiments confirm that the Dll4/Dlb-Notch3-Hey1/Id2b signaling pathway regulates MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:14:12	2024-03-06T20:14:12Z		2882-2898		12	69		Glia								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34415582 PMCID: PMC8502208					Animals; Ascl1; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Proliferation; Neuroglia; Receptors, Notch; Retina; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; dll4; notch3; reprogramming; stem cell; zebrafish

How neural crest cells differentiate into diverse cell types is a fundamental question in the study of vertebrate biology. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional changes associated with neural crest cell development in the zebrafish trunk during the early stages of migration. We show that neural crest cells are transcriptionally diverse and identify pre-migratory populations already expressing genes associated with differentiated derivatives, specifically in the xanthophore lineage. Further, we identify a population of Rohon-Beard neurons in the data. The data presented identify novel genetic markers for multiple trunk neural crest cell populations and Rohon-Beard neurons providing insight into previously uncharacterized genes critical for vertebrate development.	2021-08-16	2024-03-06 20:14:12	2024-03-06T20:14:12Z		e66078			10		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34397384 PMCID: PMC8367380					Animals; Cell Lineage; Cell Movement; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression; Genetic Markers; Neural Crest; Neurons; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; developmental biology; neural crest cells; pigment development; rohon-beard cells; scRNA-seq; xanthophores; zebrafish

Fxr signaling and microbial metabolism of bile salts in the zebrafish intestine	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.abg1371		Bile salt synthesis, secretion into the intestinal lumen, and resorption in the ileum occur in all vertebrate classes. In mammals, bile salt composition is determined by host and microbial enzymes, affecting signaling through the bile salt-binding transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (Fxr). However, these processes in other vertebrate classes remain poorly understood. We show that key components of hepatic bile salt synthesis and ileal transport pathways are conserved and under control of Fxr in zebrafish. Zebrafish bile salts consist primarily of a C27 bile alcohol and a C24 bile acid that undergo multiple microbial modifications including bile acid deconjugation that augments Fxr activity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide a cellular atlas of the zebrafish intestinal epithelium and uncover roles for Fxr in transcriptional and differentiation programs in ileal and other cell types. These results establish zebrafish as a nonmammalian vertebrate model for studying bile salt metabolism and Fxr signaling.	2021-07	2024-03-06 20:14:11	2024-03-06T20:14:11Z		eabg1371		30	7		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34301599 PMCID: PMC8302129					Animals; Bile Acids and Salts; Intestines; Liver; Mammals; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

In this study, the locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae was assessed under the exposure to 0.1-20 μM PFOS based on its reported neurobehavioral effect. After the number of zebrafish larvae was optimized for proteomics and metabolomics studies, three kinds of omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) were carried out with zebrafish larvae exposed to 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μM PFOS. More importantly, a data-driven integration of multi-omics was performed to elucidate the toxicity mechanism involved in developmental neurotoxicity. In a concentration-dependent manner, exposure to PFOS provoked hyperactivity and hypoactivity under light and dark conditions, respectively. Individual omics revealed that PFOS exposure caused perturbations in the pathways of neurological function, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. Integrated omics implied that there were decisive pathways for axonal deformation, neuroinflammatory stimulation, and dysregulation of calcium ion signaling, which are more clearly specified for neurotoxicity. Overall, our findings broaden the molecular understanding of the developmental neurotoxicity of PFOS, for which multi-omics and integrated omics analyses are efficient for discovering the significant molecular pathways related to developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:14:11	2024-03-06T20:14:11Z		106802			157		Environ Int								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34358914					Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fluorocarbons; Integration; Larva; Multi-omics; Neurotoxicity; Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) is a bona fide marker of endothelial cells during early development. In zebrafish Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 , we identified two endothelial cell populations, high-fli1+ and low-fli1+, by the intensity of green fluorescent protein signal. By comparing RNA-sequencing analysis of non-fli1 expressing cells (fli1-) with these two (fli1+) cell populations, we identified several up-regulated genes, not previously recognized as important, during endothelial development. Compared with fli1- and low-fli1+ cells, high-fli1+ cells showed up-regulated expression of the zinc finger transcription factor PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 16 (prdm16). Prdm16 knockdown (KD) by morpholino in the zebrafish larva was associated with impaired angiogenesis and increased number of low-fli1+ cells at the expense of high-fli1+ cells. In addition, PRDM16 KD in endothelial cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells impaired their differentiation and migration in vitro. Moreover, zebrafish mutants (mut) with loss of function for the oncogene LIM domain only 2 (lmo2) also showed reduced prdm16 gene expression combined with impaired angiogenesis. Prdm16 expression was reduced further in endothelial (CD31+) cells compared with CD31- cells isolated from lmo2-mutants (lmo2-mut) embryos. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR demonstrated that Lmo2 binds to the promoter and directly regulates the transcription of prdm16 This work unveils a mechanism by which prdm16 expression is activated in endothelial cells by Lmo2 and highlights a possible therapeutic pathway by which to modulate endothelial cell growth and repair.	2021-08-03	2024-03-06 20:14:11	2024-03-06T20:14:11Z		e2008559118		31	118		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34330825 PMCID: PMC8346798					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1; RNA-Seq; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; angiogenesis; differentiation; endothelial cells; epigenetic factors; zebrafish

Metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling of adult mice and larval zebrafish leptin mutants reveal a common pattern of changes in metabolites and signaling pathways	Cell & Bioscience		2045-3701	10.1186/s13578-021-00642-0		BACKGROUND: Leptin plays a critical role in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism and cross talks between leptin and metabolic pathways leading to metabolic homeostasis across different species are not clear. This study aims to explore the effects of leptin in mice and zebrafish larvae by integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics. Different metabolomic approaches including mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution magic-angle-spinning NMR spectrometry were used to investigate the metabolic changes caused by leptin deficiency in mutant ob/ob adult mice and lepb-/- zebrafish larvae. For transcriptome studies, deep RNA sequencing was used. RESULTS: Thirteen metabolites were identified as common biomarkers discriminating ob/ob mice and lepb-/- zebrafish larvae from their respective wild type controls: alanine, citrulline, ethanolamine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, putrescine, serine and threonine. Moreover, we also observed that glucose and lipid levels were increased in lepb-/- zebrafish larvae compared to the lepb+/+ group. Deep sequencing showed that many genes involved in proteolysis and arachidonic acid metabolism were dysregulated in ob/ob mice heads and lepb mutant zebrafish larvae compared to their wild type controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin deficiency leads to highly similar metabolic alterations in metabolites in both mice and zebrafish larvae. These metabolic changes show similar features as observed during progression of tuberculosis in human patients, mice and zebrafish larvae. In addition, by studying the transcriptome, we found similar changes in gene regulation related to proteolysis and arachidonic acid metabolism in these two different in vivo models.	2021-07-07	2024-03-06 20:14:10	2024-03-06T20:14:10Z		126		1	11		Cell Biosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34233759 PMCID: PMC8265131					Diabetes; Leptin mutant zebrafish; Metabolomics; Ob/ob mice; Transcriptomics; Wasting syndrome

Due to finite available RNA sequencing data of organisms with vast cell type complexity, currently available gene annotation resources are incomplete, which poses significant challenges to the comprehensive interpretation and quantification of transcriptomes. In this chapter, we introduce 3'GAmES, a stand-alone computational pipeline for the identification and quantification of novel mRNA 3'end isoforms from 3'mRNA sequencing data. 3'GAmES expands available repositories and improves comprehensive gene-tag counting by cost-effective 3' mRNA sequencing, faithfully mirroring whole-transcriptome RNAseq measurements. By employing R and bash shell scripts (assembled in a Singularity container) 3'GAmES systematically augments cell type-specific 3' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts and increases the sensitivity of quantitative gene expression profiling by 3' mRNA sequencing.

METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis was utilized to create pcsk9 knock-out (KO) zebrafish, which were infected with S pneumoniae to assess the role of PCSK9 for the survival of the fish and in the transcriptomic response of the liver. The direct effects of PCSK9 on the expression of acute-phase reaction (APR) genes were studied in HepG2 cells. RESULTS: The pcsk9 KO zebrafish lines (pcsk9tpu-13 and pcsk9tpu-2,+15 ) did not show developmental defects or gross phenotypical differences. In the S pneumoniae infected zebrafish, the mortality of pcsk9 KOs was similar to the controls. A liver-specific gene expression analysis revealed that a pneumococcal challenge upregulated pcsk9, and that the pcsk9 deletion reduced the expression of APR genes, including hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (hamp) and complement component 7b (c7b). Accordingly, silencing PCSK9 in vitro in HepG2 cells using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) decreased HAMP expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that PCSK9 is not critical for zebrafish survival in a systemic pneumococcal infection. However, PCSK9 deficiency was associated with the lower expression of APR genes in zebrafish and altered the expression of innate immunity genes in a human hepatocyte cell line. Overall, our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for PCSK9 in APR in the liver.	2021-10	2024-03-06 20:14:09	2024-03-06T20:14:09Z		2511-2522		10	41		Liver Int								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34174143					Acute-Phase Proteins; Animals; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver; Pneumococcus; Proprotein Convertase 9; Subtilisins; Zebrafish; innate immunity; sepsis; zebrafish

Although genetic studies have identified upstream nodes controlling these networks, their regulatory logic remains poorly investigated. Here, we characterize transcriptome dynamics and chromatin accessibility in segregating NR/RPE populations in zebrafish. We analyze cis-regulatory modules and enriched transcription factor motives to show extensive network redundancy and context-dependent activity. We identify downstream targets, highlighting an early recruitment of desmosomal genes in the flattening RPE and revealing Tead factors as upstream regulators. We investigate the RPE specification network dynamics to uncover an unexpected sequence of transcription factors recruitment, which is conserved in humans. This systematic interrogation of the NR/RPE bifurcation should improve both genetic counseling for eye disorders and hiPSCs-to-RPE differentiation protocols for cell-replacement therapies in degenerative diseases.	2021-06-23	2024-03-06 20:14:09	2024-03-06T20:14:09Z		3866		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34162866 PMCID: PMC8222258					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Morphogenesis; RNA-Seq; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

Single-cell ATAC-seq reveals GATA2-dependent priming defect in myeloid and a maturation bottleneck in lymphoid lineages	Blood Advances		2473-9537	10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002992		Germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 are associated with a syndrome characterized by cytopenias, atypical infections, and increased risk of hematologic malignancies. Here, we generated a zebrafish mutant of gata2b that recapitulated the myelomonocytopenia and B-cell lymphopenia of GATA2 deficiency syndrome. Using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing of marrow cells, we showed that loss of gata2b led to contrasting alterations in chromosome accessibility in early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, associated with defects in gene expression. Within the myeloid lineage in gata2b mutant zebrafish, we identified an attenuated myeloid differentiation with reduced transcriptional priming and skewing away from the monocytic program. In contrast, in early lymphoid progenitors, gata2b loss led to accumulation of B-lymphoid transcription factor accessibility coupled with increased expression of the B-cell lineage-specification program. However, gata2b mutant zebrafish had incomplete B-cell lymphopoiesis with loss of lineage-specific transcription factor accessibility in differentiating B cells, in the context of aberrantly reduced oxidative metabolic pathways. Our results establish that transcriptional events in early progenitors driven by Gata2 are required to complete normal differentiation.	2021-07-13	2024-03-06 20:14:09	2024-03-06T20:14:09Z		2673-2686		13	5		Blood Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34170284 PMCID: PMC8221101					Animals; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; GATA2 Deficiency; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Lymphopoiesis; Transcription Factors; Xenopus Proteins; Zebrafish

However, a role for Snai1 in regulating other aspects of cardiac morphogenesis has not been reported. Using genetic, transcriptomic, and chimeric analyses in zebrafish, we find that Snai1b is required in cardiomyocytes for myocardial wall integrity. Loss of snai1b increases the frequency of cardiomyocyte extrusion away from the cardiac lumen. Extruding cardiomyocytes exhibit increased actomyosin contractility basally as revealed by enrichment of p-myosin and α-catenin epitope α-18, as well as disrupted intercellular junctions. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and snai1b mutant hearts revealed the dysregulation of intermediate filament genes, including desmin b (desmb) upregulation. Cardiomyocyte-specific desmb overexpression caused increased cardiomyocyte extrusion, recapitulating the snai1b mutant phenotype. Altogether, these results indicate that Snai1 maintains the integrity of the myocardial epithelium, at least in part by repressing desmb expression.	2021-06-21	2024-03-06 20:14:08	2024-03-06T20:14:08Z		e66143			10		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34152269 PMCID: PMC8216718					Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart; Intermediate Filaments; Myocardium; Snail Family Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cardiac development; cell biology; cell extrusion; developmental biology; tissue integrity; zebrafish

Sequential regulation of hemogenic fate and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell formation from arterial endothelium by Ezh1/2	Stem Cell Reports		2213-6711	10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.05.014		Across species, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise during embryogenesis from a specialized arterial population, termed hemogenic endothelium. Here, we describe a mechanistic role for the epigenetic regulator, Enhancer of zeste homolog-1 (Ezh1), in vertebrate HSPC production via regulation of hemogenic commitment. Loss of ezh1 in zebrafish embryos favored acquisition of hemogenic (gata2b) and HSPC (runx1) fate at the expense of the arterial program (ephrinb2a, dll4). In contrast, ezh1 overexpression blocked hematopoietic progression via maintenance of arterial gene expression. The related Polycomb group subunit, Ezh2, functioned in a non-redundant, sequential manner, whereby inhibition had no impact on arterial identity, but was capable of blocking ezh1-knockdown-associated HSPC expansion. Single-cell RNA sequencing across ezh1 genotypes revealed a dropout of ezh1+/- cells among arterial endothelium associated with positive regulation of gene transcription. Exploitation of Ezh1/2 modulation has potential functional relevance for improving in vitro HSPC differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cell sources.	2021-07-13	2024-03-06 20:14:08	2024-03-06T20:14:08Z		1718-1734		7	16		Stem Cell Reports								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34143974 PMCID: PMC8282472					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Endothelial Cells; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Ezh1; Ezh2; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Loss of Function Mutation; Lymphocytes; Mice; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; RNA-Seq; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT); hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC); hemogenic endothelium (HE); zebrafish

Normal functions of PrPC are poorly understood, though recent proteomic and transcriptomic approaches have begun to reveal common themes. We use our compound prp1 and prp2 knockout mutant zebrafish at three days post fertilization to take a transcriptomic approach to investigating potentially conserved PrPC functions during development. Gene ontology analysis shows the biological processes with the largest changes in gene expression include redox processing, transport and cell adhesion. Within these categories several different gene families were prevalent including the solute carrier proteins, cytochrome p450 enzymes and protocadherins. Continuing from previous studies identifying cell adhesion as an important function of PrPC we found that in addition to the protocadherins there was a significant reduction in transcript abundance of both ncam1a and st8sia2. These two genes are involved in the early development of vertebrates. The alterations in cell adhesion transcripts were consistent with past findings in zebrafish and mouse prion protein mutants; however E-cadherin processing after prion protein knockdown failed to reveal any differences compared with wild type in either our double prp1/prp2 mutant fish or after prp1 morpholino knockdown. Our data supports a cross species conserved role for PrPC in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system, particularly by regulating various and important cell adhesion processes.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:14:08	2024-03-06T20:14:08Z		70-81		1	15		Prion								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34139950 PMCID: PMC8216189					Animals; Mice; Prion Diseases; Prion Proteins; Prion knockout; Proteomics; Protocadherins; RNA-sequencing; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; cell adhesion; scrapie; transcriptome

Loss of MBNL protein function through sequestration by CUG or CCUG RNA repeats is largely responsible for the phenotypes of the human genetic disorder myotonic dystrophy (DM). We generated the first stable zebrafish (Danio rerio) models of DM-associated MBNL loss of function through mutation of the three zebrafish mbnl genes. In contrast to mouse models, zebrafish double and triple homozygous mbnl mutants were viable to adulthood. Zebrafish mbnl mutants displayed disease-relevant physical phenotypes including decreased body size and impaired movement. They also exhibited widespread alternative splicing changes, including the misregulation of many DM-relevant exons. Physical and molecular phenotypes were more severe in compound mbnl mutants than in single mbnl mutants, suggesting partially redundant functions of Mbnl proteins. The high fecundity and larval optical transparency of this complete series of zebrafish mbnl mutants will make them useful for studying DM-related phenotypes and how individual Mbnl proteins contribute to them, and for testing potential therapeutics. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.	2021-06-01	2024-03-06 20:14:07	2024-03-06T20:14:07Z		dmm045773		6	14		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34125183 PMCID: PMC8246264					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Homozygote; MBNL1; MBNL2; MBNL3; Mutation; Myotonic Dystrophy; Myotonic dystrophy; Phenotype; RNA-Binding Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish disease models

Reduced expression of the zebrafish FMR1 orthologous gene, fmr1, causes developmental and behavioural phenotypes related to FXS. Zebrafish homozygous for the hu2787 non-sense mutation allele of fmr1 are widely used to model FXS, although FXS-relevant phenotypes seen from morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (morpholino) suppression of fmr1 transcript translation were not observed when hu2787 was first described. The subsequent discovery of transcriptional adaptation (a form of genetic compensation), whereby mutations causing non-sense-mediated decay of transcripts can drive compensatory upregulation of homologous transcripts independent of protein feedback loops, suggested an explanation for the differences reported. We examined the whole-embryo transcriptome effects of homozygosity for fmr1 h u2787 at 2 days post fertilisation. We observed statistically significant changes in expression of a number of gene transcripts, but none from genes showing sequence homology to fmr1. Enrichment testing of differentially expressed genes implied effects on lysosome function and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. The majority of the differentially expressed genes are located, like fmr1, on Chromosome 14. Quantitative PCR tests did not support that this was artefactual due to changes in relative chromosome abundance. Enrichment testing of the "leading edge" differentially expressed genes from Chromosome 14 revealed that their co-location on this chromosome may be associated with roles in brain development and function. The differential expression of functionally related genes due to mutation of fmr1, and located on the same chromosome as fmr1, is consistent with R.A. Fisher's assertion that the selective advantage of co-segregation of particular combinations of alleles of genes will favour, during evolution, chromosomal rearrangements that place them in linkage disequilibrium on the same chromosome. However, we cannot exclude that the apparent differential expression of genes on Chromosome 14 genes was, (if only in part), caused by differences between the expression of alleles of genes unrelated to the effects of the fmr1 h u2787 mutation and made manifest due to the limited, but non-zero, allelic diversity between the genotypes compared.	2021	2024-03-06 20:14:07	2024-03-06T20:14:07Z		625466			12		Front Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34135935 PMCID: PMC8203322					FMR1; chromosome evolution; fragile X syndrome; homeostasis; linkage disequilibrium; transcriptional adaptation; transcriptome analysis; zebrafish

However, systematic analysis of these processes is hindered by a lack of spatio-temporal information in single-cell RNA sequencing. Here, we combine spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA labeling to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the transcriptome during early zebrafish development. We measure spatial localization of mRNA molecules within the one-cell stage embryo, which allows us to identify a class of mRNAs that are specifically localized at an extraembryonic position, the vegetal pole. Furthermore, we establish a method for high-throughput single-cell RNA labeling in early zebrafish embryos, which enables us to follow the fate of individual maternal transcripts until gastrulation. This approach reveals that many localized transcripts are specifically transported to the primordial germ cells. Finally, we acquire spatial transcriptomes of two xenopus species and compare evolutionary conservation of localized genes as well as enriched sequence motifs.	2021-06-07	2024-03-06 20:14:06	2024-03-06T20:14:06Z		3358		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34099733 PMCID: PMC8184788					Animals; Cell Tracking; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Oocytes; RNA, Messenger; Single-Cell Analysis; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Species Specificity; Transcriptome; Xenopus; Xenopus laevis; Zebrafish

However, the therapeutic function and the underlying mechanism of Tanshinone in AML are not clear, and the toxic effect of Tanshinone limits its clinical application. Methods: Our work utilizes human leukemia cell lines, zebrafish transgenics and xenograft models to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how Tanshinone affects normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. WISH, Sudan Black and O-Dianisidine Staining were used to determine the expression of hematopoietic genes on zebrafish embryos. RNA-seq analysis showed that differential expression genes and enrichment gene signature with Tan I treatment. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method was used with a BIAcore T200 (GE Healthcare) to measure the binding affinities of Tan I. In vitro methyltransferase assay was performed to verify Tan I inhibits the histone enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex. ChIP-qPCR assay was used to determine the H3K27me3 level of EZH2 target genes. Results: We found that Tanshinone I (Tan I), one of the Tanshinones, can inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia cells in vitro and in the xenograft zebrafish model, as well as the normal and malignant definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Mechanistic studies illustrate that Tan I regulates normal and malignant hematopoiesis through direct binding to EZH2, a well-known histone H3K27 methyltransferase, and inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we identified MMP9 and ABCG2 as two possible downstream genes of Tan I's effects on EZH2. Conclusions: Together, this study confirmed that Tan I is a novel EZH2 inhibitor and suggested MMP9 and ABCG2 as two potential therapeutic targets for myeloid malignant diseases.	2021	2024-03-06 20:14:06	2024-03-06T20:14:06Z		6891-6904		14	11		Theranostics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34093860 PMCID: PMC8171091					ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Abietanes; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; EZH2; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; H3K27me3; Hematopoiesis; Histones; Humans; Leukemia; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Neoplasm Proteins; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Protein Binding; RNA-Seq; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Tanshinone I; Transcriptome; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish; hematopoiesis; leukemia

Heart cryoinjury in zebrafish triggers the formation of a fibrotic scar that gradually degrades, leading to regeneration. Midkine-a (Mdka) is a multifunctional cytokine that is activated after cardiac injury. Here, we investigated the role of mdka in zebrafish heart regeneration. We show that mdka expression was induced at 1-day post-cryoinjury (dpci) throughout the epicardial layer, whereas by 7 dpci expression had become restricted to the epicardial cells covering the injured area. To study the role of mdka in heart regeneration, we generated mdka-knock out (KO) zebrafish strains. Analysis of injured hearts showed that loss of mdka decreased endothelial cell proliferation and resulted in an arrest in heart regeneration characterized by retention of a collagenous scar. Transcriptional analysis revealed increases in collagen transcription and intense TGFβ signaling activity. These results reveal a critical role for mdka in fibrosis regulation during heart regeneration.	2021	2024-03-06 20:14:06	2024-03-06T20:14:06Z		669439			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34026760 PMCID: PMC8138450					Midkine-a; collagen; epicardium; fibrotic scar; signaling/signaling pathways; zebrafish heart regeneration

Harnessing the intrinsic ability of the RPE to self-repair is an attractive therapeutic strategy; however, mammalian RPE is limited in its regenerative capacity. Zebrafish possess tremendous intrinsic regenerative potential in ocular tissues, including the RPE, but little is known about the mechanisms driving RPE regeneration. Here, utilizing transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines, pharmacological manipulations, transcriptomics, and imaging analyses, we identified elements of the immune response as critical mediators of intrinsic RPE regeneration. After genetic ablation, the RPE express immune-related genes, including leukocyte recruitment factors such as interleukin 34 We demonstrate that macrophage/microglia cells are responsive to RPE damage and that their function is required for the timely progression of the regenerative response. These data identify the molecular and cellular underpinnings of RPE regeneration and hold significant potential for translational approaches aimed toward promoting a pro-regenerative environment in mammalian RPE.	2021-05-25	2024-03-06 20:14:05	2024-03-06T20:14:05Z		e2017198118		21	118		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34006636 PMCID: PMC8166181					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Blindness; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Immunity; Interleukins; Microglia; Mutation; Regeneration; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; inflammation; macrophage; microglia; regeneration; retinal pigment epithelium

Subsequently, a subset of OPCs differentiates into mature oligodendrocytes, which myelinate axons. This process is necessary for efficient neuronal signaling and organism survival. Previous studies have identified several factors that influence OPC development, including excitatory glutamatergic synapses that form between neurons and OPCs during myelination. However, little is known about how glutamate signaling affects OPC migration before myelination. In this study, we use in vivo, time-lapse imaging in zebrafish in conjunction with genetic and pharmacological perturbation to investigate OPC migration and myelination when the GluR4A ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit is disrupted. In our studies, we observed that gria4a mutant embryos and larvae displayed abnormal OPC migration and altered dorsoventral distribution in the spinal cord. Genetic mosaic analysis confirmed that these effects were cell-autonomous, and we identified that voltage-gated calcium channels were downstream of glutamate receptor signaling in OPCs and could rescue the migration and myelination defects we observed when glutamate signaling was perturbed. These results offer new insights into the complex system of neuron-OPC interactions and reveal a cell-autonomous role for glutamatergic signaling in OPCs during neural development.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is an essential process during development that leads to uniform oligodendrocyte distribution and sufficient myelination for central nervous system function. Here, we demonstrate that the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluR4A is an important driver of OPC migration and myelination in vivo and that activated voltage-gated calcium channels are downstream of glutamate receptor signaling in mediating this migration.	2021-06-23	2024-03-06 20:14:04	2024-03-06T20:14:04Z		5353-5371		25	41		J Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33975920 PMCID: PMC8221590					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Glutamic Acid; Neurogenesis; Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells; Receptors, AMPA; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord; Zebrafish; glutamate signaling; myelin; oligodendrocyte; oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; zebrafish

L.; Hardiman, Gary	Induced Torpor as a Countermeasure for Low Dose Radiation Exposure in a Zebrafish Model	Cells		2073-4409	10.3390/cells10040906		The development of the Artemis programme with the goal of returning to the moon is spurring technology advances that will eventually take humans to Mars and herald a new era of interplanetary space travel. However, long-term space travel poses unique challenges including exposure to ionising radiation from galactic cosmic rays and potential solar particle events, exposure to microgravity and specific nutritional challenges arising from earth independent exploration. Ionising radiation is one of the major obstacles facing future space travel as it can generate oxidative stress and directly damage cellular structures such as DNA, in turn causing genomic instability, telomere shortening, extracellular-matrix remodelling and persistent inflammation. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) this can lead to leaky gut syndrome, perforations and motility issues, which impact GIT functionality and affect nutritional status. While current countermeasures such as shielding from the spacecraft can attenuate harmful biological effects, they produce harmful secondary particles that contribute to radiation exposure. We hypothesised that induction of a torpor-like state would confer a radioprotective effect given the evidence that hibernation extends survival times in irradiated squirrels compared to active controls. To test this hypothesis, a torpor-like state was induced in zebrafish using melatonin treatment and reduced temperature, and radiation exposure was administered twice over the course of 10 days. The protective effects of induced-torpor were assessed via RNA sequencing and qPCR of mRNA extracted from the GIT. Pathway and network analysis were performed on the transcriptomic data to characterise the genomic signatures in radiation, torpor and torpor + radiation groups. Phenotypic analyses revealed that melatonin and reduced temperature successfully induced a torpor-like state in zebrafish as shown by decreased metabolism and activity levels. Genomic analyses indicated that low dose radiation caused DNA damage and oxidative stress triggering a stress response, including steroidal signalling and changes to metabolism, and cell cycle arrest. Torpor attenuated the stress response through an increase in pro-survival signals, reduced oxidative stress via the oxygen effect and detection and removal of misfolded proteins. This proof-of-concept model provides compelling initial evidence for utilizing an induced torpor-like state as a potential countermeasure for radiation exposure.	2021-04-14	2024-03-06 20:14:04	2024-03-06T20:14:04Z		906		4	10		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33920039 PMCID: PMC8071006					Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Melatonin; Models, Animal; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Radiation Exposure; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Physiological; Survival Analysis; Temperature; Torpor; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; bioinformatics; countermeasure; metabolism; radiation; signalling pathways; space; temperature; torpor; transcriptome; zebrafish

Cell-specific transcriptional control of mitochondrial metabolism by TIF1γ drives erythropoiesis	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aaz2740		Transcription and metabolism both influence cell function, but dedicated transcriptional control of metabolic pathways that regulate cell fate has rarely been defined. We discovered, using a chemical suppressor screen, that inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) rescues erythroid differentiation in bloodless zebrafish moonshine (mon) mutant embryos defective for transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (tif1γ). This rescue depends on the functional link of DHODH to mitochondrial respiration. The transcription elongation factor TIF1γ directly controls coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis gene expression. Upon tif1γ loss, CoQ levels are reduced, and a high succinate/α-ketoglutarate ratio leads to increased histone methylation. A CoQ analog rescues mon's bloodless phenotype. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial metabolism is a key output of a lineage transcription factor that drives cell fate decisions in the early blood lineage.	2021-05-14	2024-03-06 20:14:04	2024-03-06T20:14:04Z		716-721		6543	372		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33986176 PMCID: PMC8177078					Animals; Citric Acid Cycle; DNA Methylation; Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase; Electron Transport; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Enzyme Inhibitors; Erythropoiesis; Gene Expression Regulation; Histones; Leflunomide; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Methylation; Mitochondria; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors; Oxygen Consumption; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Ubiquinone; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Transcriptomic Changes and the Roles of Cannabinoid Receptors and PPARγ in Developmental Toxicities Following Exposure to Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfab046		Human consumption of cannabinoid-containing products during early life or pregnancy is rising. However, information about the molecular mechanisms involved in early life stage Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) toxicities is critically lacking. Here, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to measure THC- and CBD-mediated changes on transcriptome and the roles of cannabinoid receptors (Cnr) 1 and 2 and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARγ) in developmental toxicities. Transcriptomic profiling of 96-h postfertilization (hpf) cnr+/+ embryos exposed (6 - 96 hpf) to 4 μM THC or 0.5 μM CBD showed differential expression of 904 and 1095 genes for THC and CBD, respectively, with 360 in common. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched in the THC and CBD datasets included those related to drug, retinol, and steroid metabolism and PPAR signaling. The THC exposure caused increased mortality and deformities (pericardial and yolk sac edemas, reduction in length) in cnr1-/- and cnr2-/- fish compared with cnr+/+ suggesting Cnr receptors are involved in protective pathways. Conversely, the cnr1-/- larvae were more resistant to CBD-induced malformations, mortality, and behavioral alteration implicating Cnr1 in CBD-mediated toxicity. Behavior (decreased distance travelled) was the most sensitive endpoint to THC and CBD exposure. Coexposure to the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 and CBD in cnr+/+ and cnr2-/- strains caused more adverse outcomes compared with CBD alone, but not in the cnr1-/- fish, suggesting that PPARγ plays a role in CBD metabolism downstream of Cnr1. Collectively, PPARγ, Cnr1, and Cnr2 play important roles in the developmental toxicity of cannabinoids with Cnr1 being the most critical.	2021-07-16	2024-03-06 20:14:03	2024-03-06T20:14:03Z		44-59		1	182		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33892503 PMCID: PMC8285010					Animals; Cannabidiol; Dronabinol; Humans; PPARγ; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; RNAseq; Receptors, Cannabinoid; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; behavior; cannabidiol; development; tetrahydrocannabinol

Actively maintained ionic homeostasis of the mammalian inner ear endolymph is essential for HC function. In contrast, fish lateral line HCs are exposed to the fluctuating ionic composition of the aqueous environment. Using lineage labeling, in vivo time-lapse imaging and scRNA-seq, we discovered highly motile skin-derived cells that invade mature mechanosensory organs of the zebrafish lateral line and differentiate into Neuromast-associated (Nm) ionocytes. This invasion is adaptive as it is triggered by environmental fluctuations. Our discovery of Nm ionocytes challenges the notion of an entirely placodally derived lateral line and identifies Nm ionocytes as likely regulators of HC function possibly by modulating the ionic microenvironment. Nm ionocytes provide an experimentally accessible in vivo system to study cell invasion and migration, as well as the physiological adaptation of vertebrate organs to changing environmental conditions.	2021-05-03	2024-03-06 20:14:03	2024-03-06T20:14:03Z		1296-1312.e7		9	56		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33878346 PMCID: PMC8142321					Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biomarkers; Cell Count; Cell Movement; Environment; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gills; Hair Cells, Auditory; Homeostasis; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lateral Line System; Receptors, Notch; Salinity; Signal Transduction; Skin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; acclimation; basal keratinocytes; cell migration; invasion; ion homeostasis; ionocytes; lateral line; neuromasts; sensory hair cells; zebrafish

Phenotypically Anchored mRNA and miRNA Expression Profiling in Zebrafish Reveals Flame Retardant Chemical Toxicity Networks	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2021.663032		The ubiquitous use of flame retardant chemicals (FRCs) in the manufacture of many consumer products leads to inevitable environmental releases and human exposures. Studying toxic effects of FRCs as a group is challenging since they widely differ in physicochemical properties. We previously used zebrafish as a model to screen 61 representative FRCs and showed that many induced behavioral and teratogenic effects, with aryl phosphates identified as the most active. In this study, we selected 10 FRCs belonging to diverse physicochemical classes and zebrafish toxicity profiles to identify the gene expression responses following exposures. For each FRC, we executed paired mRNA-micro-RNA (miR) sequencing, which enabled us to study mRNA expression patterns and investigate the role of miRs as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. We found widespread disruption of mRNA and miR expression across several FRCs. Neurodevelopment was a key disrupted biological process across multiple FRCs and was corroborated by behavioral deficits. Several mRNAs (e.g., osbpl2a) and miRs (e.g., mir-125b-5p), showed differential expression common to multiple FRCs (10 and 7 respectively). These common miRs were also predicted to regulate a network of differentially expressed genes with diverse functions, including apoptosis, neurodevelopment, lipid regulation and inflammation. Commonly disrupted transcription factors (TFs) such as retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D regulator were predicted to regulate a wide network of differentially expressed mRNAs across a majority of the FRCs. Many of the differential mRNA-TF and mRNA-miR pairs were predicted to play important roles in development as well as cancer signaling. Specific comparisons between TBBPA and its derivative TBBPA-DBPE showed contrasting gene expression patterns that corroborated with their phenotypic profiles. The newer generation FRCs such as IPP and TCEP produced distinct gene expression changes compared to the legacy FRC BDE-47. Our study is the first to establish a mRNA-miR-TF regulatory network across a large group of structurally diverse FRCs and diverse phenotypic responses. The purpose was to discover common and unique biological targets that will help us understand mechanisms of action for these important chemicals and establish this approach as an important tool for better understanding toxic effects of environmental contaminants.	2021	2024-03-06 20:14:03	2024-03-06T20:14:03Z		663032			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33898466 PMCID: PMC8063052					flame retardants (additives, reactives); gene expression; mRNA; micro-RNA (miRNA); network analysis; neurodevelopment; transcription factors (TFs); zebrafish

This regenerative response relies, in part, on the endogenous ability of cardiomyocytes (CMs) to dedifferentiate and proliferate to replenish the lost muscle. However, CM heterogeneity and population dynamics during development and regeneration require further investigation. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses of the developing and adult zebrafish heart, we identified tnnc2 and tnni4b.3 expression as markers for CMs at early and late developmental stages, respectively. Using newly developed reporter lines for these genes, we investigated their expression dynamics during heart development and regeneration. tnnc2 reporter lines label most CMs at embryonic stages, and this labeling declines rapidly during larval stages; in adult hearts, tnnc2 reporter expression is only detectable in a small subset of CMs. Conversely, expression of a tnni4b.3 reporter is initially visible in CMs in the outer curvature of the ventricle at larval stages, and it is subsequently present in a vast majority of the CMs in adult hearts. To further characterize the adult CMs labeled by the tnnc2 (i.e., embryonic) reporter, we performed transcriptomic analyses and found that they express markers of immature CMs as well as genes encoding components of the Notch signaling pathway. In support of this finding, we observed, using two different reporters, that these CMs display higher levels of Notch signaling. Moreover, during adult heart regeneration, CMs in the injured area activate the embryonic CM reporter and downregulate the tnni4b.3 reporter, further highlighting the molecular changes in regenerating CMs. Overall, our findings provide additional evidence for CM heterogeneity in adult zebrafish.	2021-08	2024-03-06 20:14:02	2024-03-06T20:14:02Z		259-271			476		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33857482					Animals; Cardiomyocyte heterogeneity; Cardiomyocyte maturation; Cell Proliferation; Heart; Heart Ventricles; Heart development; Heart regeneration; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing pathways evolved to detect pathogens, but can also serve to cull cells with inappropriate TE activation as TEs can be viral mimetics. Epigenetic silencing of TEs is mediated in part by DNA methylation, but it is not clear if TE activation or the immune system contribute to the cellular damage caused by loss of DNA methylation. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the observation of an activated interferon response in the liver of zebrafish larvae with deletion in critical components of the DNA methylation machinery, uhrf1 and dnmt1. We focus on dissecting the relationship between DNA methylation, TE activation and induction of an immune response through cytoplasmic DNA and double stranded RNA sensing pathways and identify tnfa as a mediator of cell death in the liver of these mutants. Integrated RNAseq and methylome analysis identified LTR transposons as the most upregulated in these mutants and also the most methylated in control larvae, indicating a direct role of DNA methylation in suppressing this TE subclass. RNAseq analysis from these same samples revealed expression signatures of a type-I interferon response and of tnfa activation, mimicking the pattern of gene expression in virally infected cells. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated depletion of the cellular antiviral sensors sting and mavs reduced expression of interferon response genes and tnfa depletion dramatically reduced cell death in uhrf1 mutant livers. This suggests that the antiviral response induced by DNA hypomethylation and TE activation in the liver is mediated by the signaling pathways activated by both cytoplasmic double stranded RNA and DNA and that tnfa mediates cell death as a potential mechanism to eliminate these damaged cells.	2021	2024-03-06 20:14:02	2024-03-06T20:14:02Z		627926			12		Front Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33854502 PMCID: PMC8039153					Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1; DNA Methylation; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity; Liver; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Mimicry; Retroelements; TNFa; Trans-Activators; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Viruses; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; dnmt1; interferon; transposable element; uhrf1; zebrafish

Disruption of Cxcr3 chemotactic signaling alters lysosomal function and renders macrophages more microbicidal	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109000		Chemotaxis and lysosomal function are closely intertwined processes essential for the inflammatory response and clearance of intracellular bacteria. We used the zebrafish model to examine the link between chemotactic signaling and lysosome physiology in macrophages during mycobacterial infection and wound-induced inflammation in vivo. Macrophages from zebrafish larvae carrying a mutation in a chemokine receptor of the Cxcr3 family display upregulated expression of vesicle trafficking and lysosomal genes and possess enlarged lysosomes that enhance intracellular bacterial clearance. This increased microbicidal capacity is phenocopied by inhibiting the lysosomal transcription factor EC, while its overexpression counteracts the protective effect of chemokine receptor mutation. Tracking macrophage migration in zebrafish revealed that lysosomes of chemokine receptor mutants accumulate in the front half of cells, preventing macrophage polarization during chemotaxis and reaching sites of inflammation. Our work shows that chemotactic signaling affects the bactericidal properties and localization during chemotaxis, key aspects of the inflammatory response.	2021-04-13	2024-03-06 20:13:35	2024-03-06T20:13:35Z		109000		2	35		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33852860					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Cell Tracking; Chemotaxis; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Larva; Luminescent Proteins; Lysosomes; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages; Mutation; Mycobacterium Infections; Mycobacterium marinum; Receptors, CXCR3; Red Fluorescent Protein; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; chemotaxis; infection; inflammation; lysosome; macrophage; mycobacteria; vesicle; zebrafish

The ecotoxicological contaminant tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH) impacts embryonic development in zebrafish (Danio rerio)	Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)		1879-1514	10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105815		Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH) is a water contaminant with unknown etiology, but is believed to be a byproduct of DDT manufacturing. It is highly persistent in the environment, and bioaccumulates in marine species. TCPMOH has also been measured in human breast milk, which poses a risk for developing infants. However, almost no toxicity data is currently available. In this study, we investigate the hazard posed by developmental TCPMOH exposures using the zebrafish model (Danio rerio). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5 µM TCPMOH beginning at 24 h post fertilization (hpf). Embryonic mortality and incidence of morphological deformities increased in a concentration-dependent manner with TCPMOH exposure. RNA sequencing assessed changes in gene expression associated with acute (4 hour) exposures to 50 nM TCPMOH. Developmental exposure to TCPMOH decreased expression of ahr2, as well as metabolic enzymes cyp1a1, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, cyp1c2, and cyp2y3 (p<0.05). These findings were concordant with decreased Cyp1a1 induction measured by the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay (p<0.05). Pathways associated with xenobiotic metabolism, lipid metabolism, and transcriptional and translational regulation were decreased. Pathways involved in DNA replication and repair, carbohydrate metabolism, and endocrine function were upregulated. Overall, this study demonstrates that TCPMOH is acutely toxic to zebrafish embryos at elevated concentrations.	2021-06	2024-03-06 20:13:34	2024-03-06T20:13:34Z		105815			235		Aquat Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33838494 PMCID: PMC8113121					Animals; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1; Ecotoxicology; Embryo; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Humans; Inactivation, Metabolic; Methanol; TCPMOH; Transcriptional Activation; Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol; Trityl Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																																																																																																																				
F3YM97B5	journalArticle	2021	Pillay, Sanjana; Takahashi, Hazuki; Carninci, Piero; Kanhere, Aditi	Antisense RNAs during early vertebrate development are divided in groups with distinct features	Genome Research		1549-5469	10.1101/gr.262964.120		Long noncoding RNAs or lncRNAs are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs that are >200 nt in length. Almost 50% of lncRNAs during zebrafish development are transcribed in an antisense direction to a protein-coding gene. However, the role of these natural antisense transcripts (NATs) during development remains enigmatic. To understand NATs in early vertebrate development, we took a computational biology approach and analyzed existing as well as novel data sets. Our analysis indicates that zebrafish NATs can be divided into two major classes based on their coexpression patterns with respect to the overlapping protein-coding genes. Group 1 NATs have characteristics similar to maternally deposited RNAs in that their levels decrease as development progresses. Group 1 NAT levels are negatively correlated with that of overlapping sense-strand protein-coding genes. Conversely, Group 2 NATs are coexpressed with overlapping protein-coding genes. In contrast to Group 1, which is enriched in genes involved in developmental pathways, Group 2 protein-coding genes are enriched in housekeeping functions. Group 1 NATs also show larger overlap and higher complementarity with the sense-strand mRNAs compared to other NATs. In addition, our transcriptomics data, quantifying RNA levels from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, indicates that Group 1 NATs are more abundant in the cytosol. Based on their expression pattern, cytosolic nature, and their higher complementarity to the overlapping developmental mRNAs, we speculate that Group 1 NATs function post-transcriptionally to silence spurious expression of developmental genes.	2021-06	2024-03-06 20:13:34	2024-03-06T20:13:34Z		995-1010		6	31		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33795334 PMCID: PMC8168585					Animals; Morphogenesis; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

A myeloid-stromal niche and gp130 rescue in NOD2-driven Crohn's disease	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/s41586-021-03484-5		Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease that is frequently accompanied by aberrant healing and stricturing complications. Crosstalk between activated myeloid and stromal cells is critical in the pathogenicity of Crohn's disease1,2, and increases in intravasating monocytes are correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment3. The risk alleles with the highest effect on Crohn's disease are loss-of-function mutations in NOD24,5, which increase the risk of stricturing6. However, the mechanisms that underlie pathogenicity driven by NOD2 mutations and the pathways that might rescue a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use direct ex vivo analyses of patients who carry risk alleles of NOD2 to show that loss of NOD2 leads to dysregulated homeostasis of activated fibroblasts and macrophages. CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells from carriers of NOD2 risk alleles produce cells that express high levels of collagen, and elevation of conserved signatures is observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models of intestinal injury. The enrichment of STAT3 regulation and gp130 ligands in activated fibroblasts and macrophages suggested that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated program in NOD2-deficient cells. We show that post-treatment induction of the STAT3 pathway is correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment in patients, and demonstrate in vivo in zebrafish the amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal niche using the specific gp130 inhibitor bazedoxifene. Our results provide insights into NOD2-driven fibrosis in Crohn's disease, and suggest that gp130 blockade may benefit some patients with Crohn's disease-potentially as a complement to anti-TNF therapy.	2021-05	2024-03-06 20:13:34	2024-03-06T20:13:34Z		275-281		7858	593		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33789339 PMCID: PMC8284870					Alleles; Animals; Collagen; Crohn Disease; Cytokine Receptor gp130; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; Ileitis; Indoles; Interleukin-11; Lipopolysaccharide Receptors; Macrophages; Male; Myeloid Cells; Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stromal Cells; WT1 Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

To profile the developmental landscape of fetal HSPCs and their local niche, here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we deciphered a dynamic atlas covering 28,777 cells and 9 major cell types (23 clusters) of zebrafish caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT). We characterized four heterogeneous HSPCs with distinct lineage priming and metabolic gene signatures. Furthermore, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of CHT niche components for HSPC development, with a focus on the transcription factors and ligand-receptor networks involved in HSPC expansion. Importantly, we identified an endothelial cell-specific G protein-coupled receptor 182, followed by in vivo and in vitro functional validation of its evolutionally conserved role in supporting HSPC expansion in zebrafish and mice. Finally, comparison between zebrafish CHT and human fetal liver highlighted the conservation and divergence across evolution. These findings enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying hematopoietic niche for HSPC expansion in vivo and provide insights into improving protocols for HSPC expansion in vitro.	2021-04-06	2024-03-06 20:13:33	2024-03-06T20:13:33Z		e2015748118		14	118		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33785593 PMCID: PMC8040670					Animals; Cell Lineage; Fetus; Gene Expression Profiling; Gpr182; HSPC expansion; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Liver; Mice; Single-Cell Analysis; Stem Cell Niche; Zebrafish; caudal hematopoietic tissue; single-cell RNA-seq; zebrafish

In vivo proximity labeling identifies cardiomyocyte protein networks during zebrafish heart regeneration	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.66079		Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here, we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa, or vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.	2021-03-25	2024-03-06 20:13:33	2024-03-06T20:13:33Z		e66079			10		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33764296 PMCID: PMC8034980					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; BioID2; ErbB2; Heart; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Rho A; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; developmental biology; heart regeneration; proximity labeling; zebrafish

Ddx41 inhibition of DNA damage signaling permits erythroid progenitor expansion in zebrafish	Haematologica		1592-8721	10.3324/haematol.2020.257246		DEAD-box Helicase 41 (DDX41) is a recently identified factor mutated in hematologic malignancies whose function in hematopoiesis is unknown. Using an in vivo model of Ddx41 deficiency, we unveiled a critical role for this helicase in regulating erythropoiesis. We demonstrated that loss of ddx41 leads to anemia caused by diminished proliferation and defective differentiation of erythroid progenitors. Mis-expression and alternative splicing of cell cycle genes is rampant in ddx41 mutant erythroid progenitors. We delineated that the DNA damage response is activated in mutant cells resulting in an Ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-triggered cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of these kinases partially suppressed ddx41 mutant anemia. These findings establish a critical function for Ddx41 in promoting healthy erythropoiesis via protection from genomic stress and delineate a mechanistic framework to explore a role for ATM and ATR signaling in DDX41-mutant hematopoietic pathologies.	2022-03-01	2024-03-06 20:13:33	2024-03-06T20:13:33Z		644-654		3	107		Haematologica								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33763998 PMCID: PMC8883538					Animals; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; DNA Damage; Erythropoiesis; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

In a previous study, we generated an EOfAD-like mutation, psen1Q96_K97del, in zebrafish and performed transcriptome analysis comparing entire brains from 6-month-old wild type and heterozygous mutant fish. We identified predicted effects on mitochondrial function and endolysosomal acidification. Here we aimed to determine whether similar effects occur in 7 day post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae that might be exploited in screening of chemical libraries to find ameliorative drugs. RESULTS: We generated clutches of wild type and heterozygous psen1Q96_K97del 7 dpf larvae using a paired-mating strategy to reduce extraneous genetic variation before performing a comparative transcriptome analysis. We identified 228 differentially expressed genes and performed various bioinformatics analyses to predict cellular functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses predicted a significant effect on oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with our earlier observations of predicted effects on ATP synthesis in adult heterozygous psen1Q96_K97del brains. The dysregulation of minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM) genes strongly contributed to predicted effects on DNA replication and the cell cycle and may explain earlier observations of genome instability due to PSEN1 mutation. The upregulation of crystallin gene expression may be a response to defective activity of mutant Psen1 protein in endolysosomal acidification. Genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) were downregulated, consistent with previous studies of EOfAD mutant iPSC neurons and postmortem late onset AD brains. Also, changes in expression of genes controlling iron ion transport were observed without identifiable changes in the prevalence of transcripts containing iron responsive elements (IREs) in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). These changes may, therefore, predispose to the apparent iron dyshomeostasis previously observed in 6-month-old heterozygous psen1Q96_K97del EOfAD-like mutant brains.	2021-03-24	2024-03-06 20:13:33	2024-03-06T20:13:33Z		211		1	22		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33761877 PMCID: PMC7992352					Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Extracellular Matrix; Gene Expression Profiling; Homeostasis; Iron; Larva; Mutation; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Presenilin-1; Zebrafish

A non-canonical type 2 immune response coordinates tuberculous granuloma formation and epithelialization	Cell		1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.046		The central pathogen-immune interface in tuberculosis is the granuloma, a complex host immune structure that dictates infection trajectory and physiology. Granuloma macrophages undergo a dramatic transition in which entire epithelial modules are induced and define granuloma architecture. In tuberculosis, relatively little is known about the host signals that trigger this transition. Using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, we identify the basis of granuloma macrophage transformation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of zebrafish granulomas and analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macaques reveal that, even in the presence of robust type 1 immune responses, countervailing type 2 signals associate with macrophage epithelialization. We find that type 2 immune signaling, mediated via stat6, is absolutely required for epithelialization and granuloma formation. In mixed chimeras, stat6 acts cell autonomously within macrophages, where it is required for epithelioid transformation and incorporation into necrotic granulomas. These findings establish the signaling pathway that produces the hallmark structure of mycobacterial infection.	2021-04-01	2024-03-06 20:13:32	2024-03-06T20:13:32Z		1757-1774.e14		7	184		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33761328 PMCID: PMC8055144					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cadherins; Cell Differentiation; Disease Models, Animal; Epithelioid Cells; Granuloma; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; IL4R; Immunity; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-12; Macrophages; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Mycobacterium marinum; Necrosis; RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems; Receptors, Interleukin-4; STAT6; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; epithelialization; granuloma; macrophage; tuberculosis; zebrafish

The insecticide permethrin induces transgenerational behavioral changes linked to transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in zebrafish (Danio rerio)	The Science of the Total Environment		1879-1026	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146404		The pyrethroid insecticide permethrin is widely used for agricultural and domestic purposes. Previous data indicated that it acts as a developmental neurotoxicant and can induce transgenerational effects in non-target organisms. However, associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate permethrin-related transgenerational effects in the zebrafish model, and to identify possible molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance. Zebrafish (F0) were exposed to permethrin during early-life (2 h post-fertilization up to 28 days). The F1 and F2 offspring generations were obtained by pairing exposed F0 males and females, and were bred unexposed. Locomotor and anxiety behavior were investigated, together with transcriptomic and epigenomic (DNA methylation) changes in brains. Permethrin exposed F0 fish were hypoactive at adulthood, while males from the F1 and F2 generations showed a specific decrease in anxiety-like behavior. In F0, transcriptomic data showed enrichment in pathways related to glutamatergic synapse activity, which may partly underlie the behavioral effects. In F1 and F2 males, dysregulation of similar pathways was observed, including a subset of differentially methylated regions that were inherited from the F0 to the F2 generation and indicated stable dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling. Altogether, the present results provide novel evidence on the transgenerational neurotoxic effects of permethrin, as well as mechanistic insight: a transient exposure induces persistent transcriptional and DNA methylation changes that may translate into transgenerational alteration of glutamatergic signaling and, thus, into behavioral alterations.	2021-07-20	2024-03-06 20:13:32	2024-03-06T20:13:32Z		146404			779		Sci Total Environ								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33752003					Animals; Behavior, Animal; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Developmental neurotoxicity; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Female; Glutamatergic signaling; Insecticides; Male; Permethrin; Pesticide; Transcriptome; Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance; Zebrafish

Life Sciences		1869-1889	10.1007/s11427-020-1878-8		Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are able to self-renew and can give rise to all blood lineages throughout their lifetime, yet the mechanisms regulating HSPC development have yet to be discovered. In this study, we characterized a hematopoiesis defective zebrafish mutant line named smu07, which was obtained from our previous forward genetic screening, and found the HSPC expansion deficiency in the mutant. Positional cloning identified that slc20a1b, which encodes a sodium phosphate cotransporter, contributed to the smu07 blood phenotype. Further analysis demonstrated that mutation of slc20a1b affects HSPC expansion through cell cycle arrest at G2/M phases in a cell-autonomous manner. Our study shows that slc20a1b is a vital regulator for HSPC proliferation in zebrafish early hematopoiesis and provides valuable insights into HSPC development.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:13:32	2024-03-06T20:13:32Z		2186-2201		12	64		Sci China Life Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33751369					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; HSPC; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mutation; Phenotype; Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; slc20a1b; zebrafish

Single-cell mRNA profiling reveals changes in solute carrier expression and suggests a metabolic switch during zebrafish pronephros development	American Journal of Physiology. Renal Physiology		1522-1466	10.1152/ajprenal.00610.2020		Developing organisms need to adapt to environmental variations as well as to rapid changes in substrate availability and energy demands imposed by fast-growing tissues and organs. Little is known about the adjustments that kidneys undergo in response to these challenges. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish pronephric duct cells to understand how the developing kidney responds to changes in filtered substrates and intrinsic energy requirements. We found high levels of glucose transporters early in development and increased expression of monocarboxylate transporters at later times. This indicates that the zebrafish embryonic kidney displays a high glucose transporting capacity during early development, which is replaced by the ability to absorb monocarboxylates and amino acids at later stages. This change in transport capacity was accompanied by the upregulation of mitochondrial carriers, indicating a switch to increased oxidative phosphorylation to meet the increasing energy demand of a developing kidney.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The zebrafish embryonic kidney has high levels of glucose transporters during early development, which are replaced by monocarboxylate and amino acid transporters later on. Inhibition of Na+-glucose cotransporter-dependent glucose transport by sotagliflozin also increased slc2a1a expression, supporting the idea that the glucose transport capacity is dynamically adjusted during zebrafish pronephros development. Concurrent upregulation of mitochondrial SCL25 transporters at later stages supports the idea that the pronephros adjusts to changing substrate supplies and/or energy demands during embryonic development.	2021-05-01	2024-03-06 20:13:32	2024-03-06T20:13:32Z		F826-F837		5	320		Am J Physiol Renal Physiol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33749326					Animals; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Pronephros; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Seq; Single-Cell Analysis; Solute Carrier Proteins; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; energy metabolism; pronephros; single-cell RNA sequencing; solute carrier; zebrafish

CSF1R was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of immune disorders, hematopoietic diseases, tissue damage, tumor growth and metastasis, and so on. Hence, understanding the role of CSF1R is important. CSF1R is highly conserved among vertebrates. In zebrafish, it is encoded by the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor a (csf1ra) gene. In this study, a csf1ra-/- zebrafish mutant line was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. csf1ra-/- larvae lacked the yellow cast on their heads and over their flanks, while adult mutants had poorly formed stripes. RNA-sequence analysis revealed that genes related to bile acid secretion, fat digestion and absorption, and pancreatic secretion were differentially expressed in csf1ra-/- mutants, which led to fatty changes in the liver. In addition, genes related to locomotion were also significantly changed, with the more active movement observed in csf1ra-/- larvae. Our study demonstrated that csf1ra participates in the metabolic process and behavior. This study provides new insights into csf1ra function during zebrafish development.	2021-04-30	2024-03-06 20:13:31	2024-03-06T20:13:31Z		93-99			551		Biochem Biophys Res Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33725575					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; CRISPR/Cas9; Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor a (csf1ra); Gene Knockout Techniques; Knock out; Larva; Locomotion; Locomotion capacity; Metabolism; Mutation; Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Zebrafish

The role of Niemann-Pick type C2 in zebrafish embryonic development	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.194258		Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative lysosomal disease caused by mutations of either NPC1 or NPC2. NPC2 is a soluble lysosomal protein that functions in coordination with NPC1 to efflux cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment. Mutations of either gene result in the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in the late endosome/lysosome, and reduction of cellular cholesterol bioavailability. Zygotic null npc2m/m zebrafish showed significant unesterified cholesterol accumulation at larval stages, a reduction in body size, and motor and balance defects in adulthood. However, the phenotype at embryonic stages was milder than expected, suggesting a possible role of maternal Npc2 in embryonic development. Maternal-zygotic npc2m/m zebrafish exhibited significant developmental defects, including defective otic vesicle development/absent otoliths, abnormal head/brain development, curved/twisted body axes and no circulating blood cells, and died by 72 hpf. RNA-seq analysis conducted on 30 hpf npc2+/m and MZnpc2m/m embryos revealed a significant reduction in the expression of notch3 and other downstream genes in the Notch signaling pathway, suggesting that impaired Notch3 signaling underlies aspects of the developmental defects observed in MZnpc2m/m zebrafish.	2021-04-01	2024-03-06 20:13:31	2024-03-06T20:13:31Z		dev194258		7	148		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33722902 PMCID: PMC8077516					Animals; Biological Transport; Cholesterol; Embryonic Development; Endosomes; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Larva; Lysosomes; Membrane Proteins; Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C; Niemann–Pick type C; Niemann–Pick type C2; Notch3; Npc2; Receptor, Notch3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

HSPCs emerge from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VDA) during a specific timespan in embryonic development through endothelial hematopoietic transition (EHT). We investigated the ontogeny of HSPCs in mutant zebrafish embryos lacking functional pten, an important tumor suppressor with a central role in cell signaling. Through in vivo live imaging, we discovered that in pten mutant embryos a proportion of the HSPCs died upon emergence from the VDA, an effect rescued by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Surprisingly, inhibition of PI3K in wild-type embryos also induced HSPC death. Surviving HSPCs colonized the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) normally and committed to all blood lineages. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that inhibition of PI3K enhanced survival of multipotent progenitors, whereas the number of HSPCs with more stem-like properties was reduced. At the end of the definitive wave, loss of Pten caused a shift to more restricted progenitors at the expense of HSPCs. We conclude that PI3K signaling tightly controls HSPCs survival and both up- and downregulation of PI3K signaling reduces stemness of HSPCs.	2021-04	2024-03-06 20:13:31	2024-03-06T20:13:31Z		2741-2755		15	40		Oncogene								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33714985 PMCID: PMC8049872					Animals; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells; Survival Analysis; Zebrafish

Excessive R-loops trigger an inflammatory cascade leading to increased HSPC production	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2021.02.006		Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise during embryonic development and are essential for sustaining the blood and immune systems throughout life. Tight regulation of HSPC numbers is critical for hematopoietic homeostasis. Here, we identified DEAD-box helicase 41 (Ddx41) as a gatekeeper of HSPC production. Using zebrafish ddx41 mutants, we unveiled a critical role for this helicase in regulating HSPC production at the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. We determined that Ddx41 suppresses the accumulation of R-loops, nucleic acid structures consisting of RNA:DNA hybrids and ssDNAs whose equilibrium is essential for cellular fitness. Excess R-loop levels in ddx41 mutants triggered the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway leading to increased numbers of hemogenic endothelium and HSPCs. Elevated R-loop accumulation and inflammatory signaling were observed in human cells with decreased DDX41, suggesting possible conservation of mechanism. These findings delineate that precise regulation of R-loop levels during development is critical for limiting cGAS-STING activity and HSPC numbers.	2021-03-08	2024-03-06 20:13:30	2024-03-06T20:13:30Z		627-640.e5		5	56		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33651979 PMCID: PMC8258699					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Differentiation; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Ddx41; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Membrane Proteins; Nucleotidyltransferases; R-Loop Structures; R-loops; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; inflammatory signaling; zebrafish

Dynamic Polarization of Rab11a Modulates Crb2a Localization and Impacts Signaling to Regulate Retinal Neurogenesis	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2020.608112		Interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM) is the process in which pseudostratified epithelial nuclei oscillate from the apical to basal surface and in phase with the mitotic cycle. In the zebrafish retina, neuroepithelial retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) increase Notch activity with apical movement of the nuclei, and the depth of nuclear migration correlates with the probability that the next cell division will be neurogenic. This study focuses on the mechanisms underlying the relationships between IKNM, cell signaling, and neurogenesis. In particular, we have explored the role IKNM has on endosome biology within RPCs. Through genetic manipulation and live imaging in zebrafish, we find that early (Rab5-positive) and recycling (Rab11a-positive) endosomes polarize in a dynamic fashion within RPCs and with reference to nuclear position. Functional analyses suggest that dynamic polarization of recycling endosomes and their activity within the neuroepithelia modulates the subcellular localization of Crb2a, consequently affecting multiple signaling pathways that impact neurogenesis including Notch, Hippo, and Wnt activities. As nuclear migration is heterogenous and asynchronous among RPCs, Rab11a-affected signaling within the neuroepithelia is modulated in a differential manner, providing mechanistic insight to the correlation of IKNM and selection of RPCs to undergo neurogenesis.	2020	2024-03-06 20:13:30	2024-03-06T20:13:30Z		608112			8		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33634099 PMCID: PMC7900515					Rab11; crumbs; endocytosis; interkinetic nuclear migration; neurogenesis; recycling endosome

Localized EMT reprograms glial progenitors to promote spinal cord repair	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2021.01.017		Anti-regenerative scarring obstructs spinal cord repair in mammals and presents a major hurdle for regenerative medicine. In contrast, adult zebrafish possess specialized glial cells that spontaneously repair spinal cord injuries by forming a pro-regenerative bridge across the severed tissue. To identify the mechanisms that regulate differential regenerative capacity between mammals and zebrafish, we first defined the molecular identity of zebrafish bridging glia and then performed cross-species comparisons with mammalian glia. Our transcriptomics show that pro-regenerative zebrafish glia activate an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene program and that EMT gene expression is a major factor distinguishing mammalian and zebrafish glia. Functionally, we found that localized niches of glial progenitors undergo EMT after spinal cord injury in zebrafish and, using large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we identified the gene regulatory network that activates EMT and drives functional regeneration. Thus, non-regenerative mammalian glia lack an essential EMT-driving gene regulatory network that reprograms pro-regenerative zebrafish glia after injury.	2021-03-08	2024-03-06 20:13:30	2024-03-06T20:13:30Z		613-626.e7		5	56		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33609461 PMCID: PMC8044706					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; EMT; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Mammals; Neuroglia; Neurons; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Cord Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; astrocytes; bridging; glia; regeneration; spinal cord injury; zebrafish

Previously, we observed negative effects on phenotype, DNA methylation, and gene expression profiles, in offspring of zebrafish exposed to gamma radiation during gametogenesis. We hypothesize that previously observed effects are accompanied with changes in the expression profile of non-coding RNAs, inherited by next generations. Non-coding RNA expression profile was analysed in F1 offspring (5.5 h post-fertilization) by high-throughput sequencing 1 year after parental irradiation (8.7 mGy/h, 5.2 Gy total dose). Using our previous F1-γ genome-wide gene expression data (GSE98539), hundreds of mRNAs were predicted as targets of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, involved in pathways such as insulin receptor, NFkB and PTEN signalling, linking to apoptosis and cancer. snRNAs belonging to the five major spliceosomal snRNAs were down-regulated in the F1-γ group, Indicating transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations. In addition, DEpiRNA clusters were associated to 9 transposable elements (TEs) (LTR, LINE, and TIR) (p = 0.0024), probable as a response to the activation of these TEs. Moreover, the expression of the lincRNAs malat-1, and several others was altered in the offspring F1, in concordance with previously observed phenotypical alterations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate diverse gamma radiation-induced alterations in the ncRNA profiles of F1 offspring observable 1 year after parental irradiation.	2021-02-18	2024-03-06 20:13:30	2024-03-06T20:13:30Z		4142		1	11		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33602989 PMCID: PMC7893006					Animals; DNA Damage; DNA Methylation; Gametogenesis; Gamma Rays; RNA, Untranslated; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Insulin-like 3 affects zebrafish spermatogenic cells directly and via Sertoli cells	Communications Biology		2399-3642	10.1038/s42003-021-01708-y		Pituitary hormones can use local signaling molecules to regulate target tissue functions. In adult zebrafish testes, follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) strongly increases the production of insulin-like 3 (Insl3), a Leydig cell-derived growth factor found in all vertebrates. Little information is available regarding Insl3 function in adult spermatogenesis. The Insl3 receptors Rxfp2a and 2b were expressed by type A spermatogonia and Sertoli and myoid cells, respectively, in zebrafish testis tissue. Loss of insl3 increased germ cell apoptosis in males starting at 9 months of age, but spermatogenesis appeared normal in fully fertile, younger adults. Insl3 changed the expression of 409 testicular genes. Among others, retinoic acid (RA) signaling was up- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg) signaling was down-regulated. Follow-up studies showed that RA and Pparg signaling mediated Insl3 effects, resulting in the increased production of differentiating spermatogonia. This suggests that Insl3 recruits two locally active nuclear receptor pathways to implement pituitary (Fsh) stimulation of spermatogenesis.	2021-02-15	2024-03-06 20:13:29	2024-03-06T20:13:29Z		204		1	4		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33589679 PMCID: PMC7884674					Animals; Apoptosis; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Insulin; Male; PPAR gamma; Proteins; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Sertoli Cells; Signal Transduction; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Transcriptome; Tretinoin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, only a limited number of regulatory proteins that contribute to this complex MYCN-mediated process have been elucidated. Here we show that the growth arrest-specific 7 (GAS7) gene, located at chromosome band 17p13.1, is preferentially deleted in high-risk MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. GAS7 expression was also suppressed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma lacking 17p deletion. GAS7 deficiency led to accelerated metastasis in both zebrafish and mammalian models of neuroblastoma with overexpression or amplification of MYCN. Analysis of expression profiles and the ultrastructure of zebrafish neuroblastoma tumors with MYCN overexpression identified that GAS7 deficiency led to (i) downregulation of genes involved in cell-cell interaction, (ii) loss of contact among tumor cells as critical determinants of accelerated metastasis, and (iii) increased levels of MYCN protein. These results provide the first genetic evidence that GAS7 depletion is a critical early step in the cascade of events culminating in neuroblastoma metastasis in the context of MYCN overexpression. SIGNIFICANCE: Heterozygous deletion or MYCN-mediated repression of GAS7 in neuroblastoma releases an important brake on tumor cell dispersion and migration to distant sites, providing a novel mechanism underlying tumor metastasis in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma.See related commentary by Menard, p. 2815.	2021-06-01	2024-03-06 20:13:29	2024-03-06T20:13:29Z		2995-3007		11	81		Cancer Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33602789 PMCID: PMC8178188					Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Bone Marrow Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Chromosome Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; Mice, SCID; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuroblastoma; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish

Macrophages provide a transient muscle stem cell niche via NAMPT secretion	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/s41586-021-03199-7		Skeletal muscle regenerates through the activation of resident stem cells. Termed satellite cells, these normally quiescent cells are induced to proliferate by wound-derived signals1. Identifying the source and nature of these cues has been hampered by an inability to visualize the complex cell interactions that occur within the wound. Here we use muscle injury models in zebrafish to systematically capture the interactions between satellite cells and the innate immune system after injury, in real time, throughout the repair process. This analysis revealed that a specific subset of macrophages 'dwell' within the injury, establishing a transient but obligate niche for stem cell proliferation. Single-cell profiling identified proliferative signals that are secreted by dwelling macrophages, which include the cytokine nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt, which is also known as visfatin or PBEF in humans). Nampt secretion from the macrophage niche is required for muscle regeneration, acting through the C-C motif chemokine receptor type 5 (Ccr5), which is expressed on muscle stem cells. This analysis shows that in addition to their ability to modulate the immune response, specific macrophage populations also provide a transient stem-cell-activating niche, directly supplying proliferation-inducing cues that govern the repair process that is mediated by muscle stem cells. This study demonstrates that macrophage-derived niche signals for muscle stem cells, such as NAMPT, can be applied as new therapeutic modalities for skeletal muscle injury and disease.	2021-03	2024-03-06 20:13:28	2024-03-06T20:13:28Z		281-287		7849	591		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33568815					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Macrophages; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Skeletal; Myoblasts; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; PAX7 Transcription Factor; RNA-Seq; Receptors, CCR5; Regeneration; Single-Cell Analysis; Stem Cell Niche; Zebrafish

Phagocytic activity has a central role in scavenging apoptotic cells in differentiated tissues3-6. However, how apoptotic cells are cleared in the blastula embryo in the absence of specialized immune cells remains unknown. Here we show that the surface epithelium of zebrafish and mouse embryos, which is the first tissue formed during vertebrate development, performs efficient phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine-mediated target recognition. Quantitative four-dimensional in vivo imaging analyses reveal a collective epithelial clearance mechanism that is based on mechanical cooperation by two types of Rac1-dependent basal epithelial protrusions. The first type of protrusion, phagocytic cups, mediates apoptotic target uptake. The second, a previously undescribed type of fast and extended actin-based protrusion that we call 'epithelial arms', promotes the rapid dispersal of apoptotic targets through Arp2/3-dependent mechanical pushing. On the basis of experimental data and modelling, we show that mechanical load-sharing enables the long-range cooperative uptake of apoptotic cells by multiple epithelial cells. This optimizes the efficiency of tissue clearance by extending the limited spatial exploration range and local uptake capacity of non-motile epithelial cells. Our findings show that epithelial tissue clearance facilitates error correction that is relevant to the developmental robustness and survival of the embryo, revealing the presence of an innate immune function in the earliest stages of embryonic development.	2021-02	2024-03-06 20:13:28	2024-03-06T20:13:28Z		618-623		7847	590		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33568811					Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex; Actins; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Movement; Cell Shape; Cell Surface Extensions; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryonic Development; Epithelial Cells; Immunity, Innate; Mice; Phagocytes; Phagocytosis; Phosphatidylserines; Zebrafish; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein

Vitamin E Deficiency Disrupts Gene Expression Networks during Zebrafish Development	Nutrients		2072-6643	10.3390/nu13020468		Vitamin E (VitE) is essential for vertebrate embryogenesis, but the mechanisms involved remain unknown. To study embryonic development, we fed zebrafish adults (>55 days) either VitE sufficient (E+) or deficient (E-) diets for >80 days, then the fish were spawned to generate E+ and E- embryos. To evaluate the transcriptional basis of the metabolic and phenotypic outcomes, E+ and E- embryos at 12, 18 and 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) were subjected to gene expression profiling by RNASeq. Hierarchical clustering, over-representation analyses and gene set enrichment analyses were performed with differentially expressed genes. E- embryos experienced overall disruption to gene expression associated with gene transcription, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, intracellular signaling and the formation of embryonic structures. mTOR was apparently a major controller of these changes. Thus, embryonic VitE deficiency results in genetic and transcriptional dysregulation as early as 12 hpf, leading to metabolic dysfunction and ultimately lethal outcomes.	2021-01-30	2024-03-06 20:13:28	2024-03-06T20:13:28Z		468		2	13		Nutrients								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33573233 PMCID: PMC7912379					Animals; Blotting, Western; E+, VitE sufficient; E–, VitE deficient; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; VitE; Vitamin E Deficiency; Zebrafish; hours post-fertilization; hpf; vitamin E; α-TTP; α-tocopherol transfer protein.

In patients with myeloid malignancies, ASXL1 mutations are usually heterozygous frameshift or nonsense mutations leading to C-terminal truncation. Current disease models have predominantly total loss of ASXL1 or overexpressed C-terminal truncations. These models cannot fully recapitulate leukemogenesis and disease progression. We generated an endogenous C-terminal-truncated Asxl1 mutant in zebrafish that mimics human myeloid malignancies. At the embryonic stage, neutrophil differentiation was explicitly blocked. At 6 months, mutants initially exhibited a myelodysplastic syndrome-like phenotype with neutrophilic dysplasia. At 1 year, about 13% of mutants further acquired the phenotype of monocytosis, which mimics chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or increased progenitors, which mimics acute myeloid leukemia. These features are comparable to myeloid malignancy progression in humans. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis, inhibitor treatment, and rescue assays indicated that asxl1-induced neutrophilic dysplasia was associated with reduced expression of bmi1a, a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 1 and a reported myeloid leukemia-associated gene. Our model demonstrated that neutrophilic dysplasia caused by asxl1 mutation is a foundation for the progression of myeloid malignancies, and illustrated a possible effect of the Asxl1-Bmi1a axis on regulating neutrophil development.	2021-08	2024-03-06 20:13:27	2024-03-06T20:13:27Z		2299-2310		8	35		Leukemia								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33483612 PMCID: PMC8324474					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic; Mutation; Neutrophils; Phenotype; Repressor Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Mutations in pre-mRNAs processing factor 31 (PRPF31) cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive retinal degeneration disease. The transcriptome-wide splicing events specifically regulated by PRPF31 and their biological roles in the development and maintenance of retina are still unclear. Here, we showed that the differentiation and viability of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are severely perturbed in prpf31 knockout zebrafish when compared with other tissues at an early embryonic stage. At the cellular level, significant mitotic arrest and DNA damage were observed. These defects could be rescued by the wild-type human PRPF31 rather than the disease-associated mutants. Further bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification uncovered that Prpf31 deletion predominantly causes the skipping of exons with a weak 5' splicing site. Moreover, genes necessary for DNA repair and mitotic progression are most enriched among the differentially spliced events, which may explain the cellular and tissular defects in prpf31 mutant retinas. This is the first time that Prpf31 is demonstrated to be essential for the survival and differentiation of RPCs during retinal neurogenesis by specifically modulating the alternative splicing of genes involved in DNA repair and mitosis.	2021-02-26	2024-03-06 20:13:27	2024-03-06T20:13:27Z		2027-2043		4	49		Nucleic Acids Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33476374 PMCID: PMC7913766					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Apoptosis; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Survival; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Exons; Gene Knockout Techniques; M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Retina; Retinal Neurons; Spindle Apparatus; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The BMP signaling gradient is interpreted through concentration thresholds in dorsal-ventral axial patterning	PLoS biology		1545-7885	10.1371/journal.pbio.3001059		Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) patterns the dorsal-ventral (DV) embryonic axis in all vertebrates, but it is unknown how cells along the DV axis interpret and translate the gradient of BMP signaling into differential gene activation that will give rise to distinct cell fates. To determine the mechanism of BMP morphogen interpretation in the zebrafish gastrula, we identified 57 genes that are directly activated by BMP signaling. By using Seurat analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we found that these genes are expressed in at least 3 distinct DV domains of the embryo. We distinguished between 3 models of BMP signal interpretation in which cells activate distinct gene expression through interpretation of thresholds of (1) the BMP signaling gradient slope; (2) the BMP signal duration; or (3) the level of BMP signal activation. We tested these 3 models using quantitative measurements of phosphorylated Smad5 (pSmad5) and by examining the spatial relationship between BMP signaling and activation of different target genes at single-cell resolution across the embryo. We found that BMP signaling gradient slope or BMP exposure duration did not account for the differential target gene expression domains. Instead, we show that cells respond to 3 distinct levels of BMP signaling activity to activate and position target gene expression. Together, we demonstrate that distinct pSmad5 threshold levels activate spatially distinct target genes to pattern the DV axis.	2021-01	2024-03-06 20:13:27	2024-03-06T20:13:27Z		e3001059		1	19		PLoS Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33481775 PMCID: PMC7857602					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Body Patterning; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gastrula; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Smad5 Protein; Tissue Distribution; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Demethylation has been investigated primarily in the context of DNA, but recently Tet enzymes have also been shown to mediate demethylation of 5mC in RNA as an additional level of epitranscriptomic regulation. We analyzed compound tet2/3 mutant zebrafish and discovered a role for Tet enzymes in the maturation of primitive and definitive neutrophils during granulation. Transcript profiling showed dysregulation of cytokine signaling in tet mutant neutrophils, including upregulation of socs3b. We show that Tet normally demethylates socs3b mRNA during granulation, thereby destabilizing the transcript, leading to its downregulation. Failure of this process leads to accumulation of socs3b mRNA and repression of cytokine signaling at this crucial step of neutrophil maturation. This study provides further evidence for Tets as epitranscriptomic regulatory enzymes and implicates Tet2/3 in regulation of neutrophil maturation.	2021-01-12	2024-03-06 20:13:26	2024-03-06T20:13:26Z		108632		2	34		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33440144 PMCID: PMC7837371					Animals; Demethylation; Dioxygenases; Granulation Tissue; Neutrophils; RNA; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cytokine; epitranscriptomics; mRNA stability; methylation; myelopoiesis

Currently, no definite treatment exists for CM. A de novo mutation in Tropomyosin 3-TPM3(E151G) was identified from a boy diagnosed with CM, previously TPM3(E151A) was reported to cause CM. However, the role of TPM3(E151G) in CM is unknown. METHODS: Histopathological, swimming behavior, and muscle endurance were monitored in TPM3 wild-type and mutant transgenic fish, modelling CM. Gene expression profiling of muscle of the transgenic fish were studied through RNAseq, and mitochondria respiration was investigated. RESULTS: While TPM3(WT) and TPM3(E151A) fish show normal appearance, amazingly a few TPM3(E151G) fish display either no tail, a crooked body in both F0 and F1 adults. Using histochemical staining for the muscle biopsy, we found TPM3(E151G) displays congenital fiber type disproportion and TPM3(E151A) resembles nemaline myopathy. TPM3(E151G) transgenic fish dramatically swimming slower than those in TPM3(WT) and TPM3(E151A) fish measured by DanioVision and T-maze, and exhibit weaker muscle endurance by swimming tunnel instrument. Interestingly, L-carnitine treatment on TPM3(E151G) transgenic larvae significantly improves the muscle endurance by restoring the basal respiration and ATP levels in mitochondria. With RNAseq transcriptomic analysis of the expression profiling from the muscle specimens, it surprisingly discloses large downregulation of genes involved in pathways of sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, which can be rescued by L-carnitine treatment, fatty acid metabolism was differentially dysregulated in TPM3(E151G) fish and rescued by L-carnitine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that TPM3(E151G) and TPM3(E151A) exhibit different pathogenicity, also have distinct gene regulatory profiles but the ion channels were downregulated in both mutants, and provides a potential mechanism of action of TPM3 pathophysiology. Our results shed a new light in the future development of potential treatment for TPM3-related CM.	2021-01-12	2024-03-06 20:13:26	2024-03-06T20:13:26Z		8		1	28		J Biomed Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33435938 PMCID: PMC7802209					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carnitine; Congenital myopathy; L-Carnitine; Muscle, Skeletal; Myotonia Congenita; Tropomyosin; Tropomyosin 3 (TPM3); Zebrafish

Mutations in the transcription factor NKX3.2 underlie spondylo-megaepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia (SMMD), which is characterized by skeletal defects including scoliosis, large epiphyses, wide growth plates and supernumerary distal limb joints. Whereas nkx3.2 knockdown zebrafish and mouse Nkx3.2 mutants display embryonic lethal jaw joint fusions and skeletal reductions, respectively, they lack the skeletal overgrowth seen in SMMD patients. Here, we report adult viable nkx3.2 mutant zebrafish displaying cartilage overgrowth in place of a missing jaw joint, as well as severe dysmorphologies of the facial skeleton, skullcap and spine. In contrast, cartilage overgrowth and scoliosis are absent in rare viable nkx3.2 knockdown animals that lack jaw joints, supporting post-embryonic roles for Nkx3.2. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo validation reveal increased proliferation and upregulation of stress-induced pathways, including prostaglandin synthases, in mutant chondrocytes. By generating a zebrafish model for the skeletal overgrowth defects of SMMD, we reveal post-embryonic roles for Nkx3.2 in dampening proliferation and buffering the stress response in joint-associated chondrocytes.	2021-01-25	2024-03-06 20:13:26	2024-03-06T20:13:26Z		dev193409		2	148		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33462117 PMCID: PMC7860120					Animals; Bone and Bones; Cartilage; Chondrocyte; Chondrocytes; Disease Models, Animal; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Homeodomain Proteins; Jaw; Joint; Joints; Mitosis; Morpholinos; Mutation; Nkx3.2; Osteochondrodysplasias; Proliferation; RNA-Seq; Single-Cell Analysis; Skull; Spine; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, it is largely unknown how much underlying microscopic variability is compatible with normal development. Here, we quantify embryo-to-embryo variability in vertebrate development by studying cell number variation in the zebrafish endoderm. We notice that the size of a sub-population of the endoderm, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs, which later form the left-right organizer), exhibits significantly more embryo-to-embryo variation than the rest of the endoderm. We find that, with incubation of the embryos at elevated temperature, the frequency of left-right laterality defects is increased drastically in embryos with a low number of DFCs. Furthermore, we observe that these fluctuations have a large stochastic component among fish of the same genetic background. Hence, a stochastic variation in early development leads to a remarkably strong macroscopic phenotype. These fluctuations appear to be associated with maternal effects in the specification of the DFCs.	2021-01-12	2024-03-06 20:13:26	2024-03-06T20:13:26Z		108606		2	34		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33440143 PMCID: PMC7809618					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Phenotype; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; dorsal forerunner cells; early development; heart laterality; left-right asymmetry; maternal effects; phenotypic variability; zebrafish

The tissue-wide coordination of cellular dynamics that is needed for proper morphogenesis is challenged by the large dimensions of regenerating body parts. Feedback mechanisms in biochemical pathways can provide effective communication across great distances1-5, but how they might regulate growth during tissue regeneration is unresolved6,7. Here we report that rhythmic travelling waves of Erk activity control the growth of bone in time and space in regenerating zebrafish scales, millimetre-sized discs of protective body armour. We find that waves of Erk activity travel across the osteoblast population as expanding concentric rings that are broadcast from a central source, inducing ring-like patterns of tissue growth. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that Erk activity propagates as excitable trigger waves that are able to traverse the entire scale in approximately two days and that the frequency of wave generation controls the rate of scale regeneration. Furthermore, the periodic induction of synchronous, tissue-wide activation of Erk in place of travelling waves impairs tissue growth, which indicates that wave-distributed Erk activation is key to regeneration. Our findings reveal trigger waves as a regulatory strategy to coordinate cell behaviour and instruct tissue form during regeneration.	2021-02	2024-03-06 20:13:25	2024-03-06T20:13:25Z		129-133		7844	590		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33408418 PMCID: PMC7864885					Animal Scales; Animals; Diffusion; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Male; Osteoblasts; Regeneration; Zebrafish

In contrast, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the spinal lesion site of zebrafish is permissive and required for axon regeneration. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this interspecies difference have not been investigated. Here, we show that an injury to the zebrafish spinal cord triggers recruitment of pdgfrb+ myoseptal and perivascular cells in a PDGFR signaling-dependent manner. Interference with pdgfrb+ cell recruitment or depletion of pdgfrb+ cells inhibits axonal regrowth and recovery of locomotor function. Transcriptional profiling and functional experiments reveal that pdgfrb+ cells upregulate expression of axon growth-promoting ECM genes (cthrc1a and col12a1a/b) and concomitantly reduce synthesis of matrix molecules that are detrimental to regeneration (lum and mfap2). Our data demonstrate that a switch in ECM composition is critical for axon regeneration after spinal cord injury and identify the cellular source and components of the growth-promoting lesion ECM.	2021-02-22	2024-03-06 20:13:25	2024-03-06T20:13:25Z		509-524.e9		4	56		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33412105					Animals; Axons; Cicatrix; ECM; Extracellular Matrix; Models, Biological; Nerve Regeneration; PDGFRβ; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Recovery of Function; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; axon; fibroblast; myoseptal cells; optoablation; perivascular cells; regeneration; spinal cord; zebrafish

Emx2 regulates hair cell rearrangement but not positional identity within neuromasts	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.60432		Each hair cell (HC) precursor of zebrafish neuromasts divides to form two daughter HCs of opposite hair bundle orientations. Previously, we showed that transcription factor Emx2, expressed in only one of the daughter HCs, generates this bidirectional HC pattern (Jiang et al., 2017). Here, we asked whether Emx2 mediates this effect by changing location of hair bundle establishment or positions of HCs since daughter HCs are known to switch positions with each other. We showed this HC rearrangement, redefined as two processes named Rock and Roll, is required for positional acquisition of HCs. Apical protrusion formation of nascent HCs and planar polarity signaling are both important for the Rock and Roll.

It is well known that a regeneration blastema of appendages of vertebrates such as fish and amphibians grows distally. However, it remains unclear whether a regeneration blastema in vertebrate appendages can grow proximally. Here, we show that a regeneration blastema in zebrafish fins can grow proximally along the proximodistal axis by calcineurin inhibition. We used fin excavation in adult zebrafish to observe unidirectional regeneration from the anterior cut edge (ACE) to the posterior cut edge (PCE) of the cavity and this unidirectional regeneration polarity occurs as the PCE fails to build blastemas. Furthermore, we found that calcineurin activities in the ACE were greater than in the PCE. Calcineurin inhibition induced PCE blastemas, and calcineurin hyperactivation suppressed fin regeneration. Collectively, these findings identify calcineurin as a molecular switch to specify the PCE blastema of the proximodistal axis and regeneration polarity in zebrafish fin.	2021-01-12	2024-03-06 20:13:24	2024-03-06T20:13:24Z		e2009539118		2	118		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33376206 PMCID: PMC7812827					Animal Fins; Animals; Calcineurin; Cell Polarity; Extremities; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; calcineurin; fin regeneration; polarity; zebrafish

However, systematic studies and molecular mechanisms of the adverse effects of microgravity on the immune system in animal models are limited. Here, we establish a ground-based zebrafish disease model of microgravity for the research of space immunology. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that the retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptor (RLR) and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways are significantly compromised by simulated microgravity (Sμg). TRIM25, an essential E3 for RLR signaling, is inhibited under Sμg, hampering the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and the following function-induction positive feedback loop of antiviral immune response. These mechanisms provide insights into better understanding of the effects and principles of microgravity on host antiviral immunity and present broad potential implications for developing strategies that can prevent and control viral diseases during space flight.	2021-01-05	2024-03-06 20:13:24	2024-03-06T20:13:24Z		108600		1	34		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33406425					Aerospace Medicine; Animals; DEAD Box Protein 58; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunity; K63-linked ubiquitination; Male; RIG-I; Rhabdoviridae; Rhabdoviridae Infections; Signal Transduction; TRIM25; Toll-Like Receptors; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Ubiquitination; Weightlessness; Zebrafish; antiviral immunity; positive feedback loop; rotary cell culture system; simulated microgravity; type I interferon; zebrafish embryo model

In the present study, we showed that transient inhibition of embryonic HSP90 function by a chemical inhibitor or low conductivity stress promoted variation of cold tolerance capacity in adult zebrafish. Further work showed that embryonic HSP90 inhibition enhanced cold tolerance in adult zebrafish could be transmitted to their offspring. RNA-seq data showed that embryonic HSP90 inhibition enhanced cold tolerance involves variation of gene expression related to proteasome, lysosome, autophagy, and ribosome. Experiments with zebrafish ZF4 cells showed that two differentially expressed genes atg9b and psmd12 were up-regulated by radicicol treatment and provided protective roles for cells under cold stress, indicating that up-regulation of autophagy and proteasome function contributes to enhanced cold tolerance. The present work sheds a light on the roles of HSP90 in regulation of phenotypic plasticity associated with thermal adaptation in fish.	2020	2024-03-06 20:13:23	2024-03-06T20:13:23Z		541944			11		Front Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33343615 PMCID: PMC7746879					Hsp90; Hsp90 inhibitor; cold tolerance; embryonic; zebrafish

Characterizing RGC diversity is required to understand the logic of the underlying functional segregation. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we systematically classified RGCs in adult and larval zebrafish, thereby identifying marker genes for >30 mature types and several developmental intermediates. We used this dataset to engineer transgenic driver lines, enabling specific experimental access to a subset of RGC types. Expression of one or few transcription factors often predicts dendrite morphologies and axonal projections to specific tectal layers and extratectal targets. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that molecularly defined RGCs exhibit specific functional tuning. Finally, chemogenetic ablation of eomesa+ RGCs, which comprise melanopsin-expressing types with projections to a small subset of central targets, selectively impaired phototaxis. Together, our study establishes a framework for systematically studying the functional architecture of the visual system.	2021-02-17	2024-03-06 20:13:23	2024-03-06T20:13:23Z		645-662.e9		4	109		Neuron								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33357413 PMCID: PMC7897282					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Locomotion; Male; Photic Stimulation; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Zebrafish; behavior; cell atlas; eomes; genetic markers; genome engineering; ipRGCs; physiology; single-cell transcriptomics; visual pathways

In situ differentiation of iridophore crystallotypes underlies zebrafish stripe patterning	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-020-20088-1		Skin color patterns are ubiquitous in nature, impact social behavior, predator avoidance, and protection from ultraviolet irradiation. A leading model system for vertebrate skin patterning is the zebrafish; its alternating blue stripes and yellow interstripes depend on light-reflecting cells called iridophores. It was suggested that the zebrafish's color pattern arises from a single type of iridophore migrating differentially to stripes and interstripes. However, here we find that iridophores do not migrate between stripes and interstripes but instead differentiate and proliferate in-place, based on their micro-environment. RNA-sequencing analysis further reveals that stripe and interstripe iridophores have different transcriptomic states, while cryogenic-scanning-electron-microscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction identify different crystal-arrays architectures, indicating that stripe and interstripe iridophores are different cell types. Based on these results, we present an alternative model of skin patterning in zebrafish in which distinct iridophore crystallotypes containing specialized, physiologically responsive, organelles arise in stripe and interstripe by in-situ differentiation.	2020-12-15	2024-03-06 20:13:23	2024-03-06T20:13:23Z		6391		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33319779 PMCID: PMC7738553					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Chromatophores; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Mutagenesis; Skin; Skin Pigmentation; Transcriptome; X-Ray Diffraction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, several transgenic zebrafish lines with single or multiple deletions of nf1, tp53 and rb1 in astrocytes, were established to genetically induce gliomagenesis in zebrafish. In the mutant with a single deletion, we found only the nf1 mutation low-efficiently induced tumour incidence, suggesting that the Nf1 pathway is critical for the initiation of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Combination of mutations, nf1;tp53 and rb1;tp53 combined knockout fish, showed much higher tumour incidences, high-grade histology, increased invasiveness, and shortened survival time. Further bioinformatics analyses demonstrated the alterations in RTK/Ras/PI3K, cell cycle, and focal adhesion pathways, induced by abrogated nf1, tp53, or rb1, were probably the critical stepwise biological events for the initiation and development of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Gene expression profiling and histological analyses showed the tumours derived from zebrafish have significant similarities to the subgroups of human gliomas. Furthermore, temozolomide treatment effectively suppressed gliomagenesis in these glioma zebrafish models, and the histological responses in temozolomide-treated zebrafish were similar to those observed in clinically treated glioma patients. Thus, our findings will offer a potential tool for genetically investigating gliomagenesis and screening potential targeted anti-tumour compounds for glioma treatment.	2021-03-03	2024-03-06 20:13:22	2024-03-06T20:13:22Z		615-635		2	144		Brain								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33279959 PMCID: PMC7940501					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Glioma; Male; Mutation; Neurofibromatosis 1; Retinoblastoma Protein; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; glioma; nf1; rb1; tp53; zebrafish

Several noncoding RNAs regulate Ybx1 signaling. However, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in embryogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of lncRNAs in Ybx1-mediated regulation of vertebrate development by performing systematic transcriptome analysis of RNA sequencing data derived from ybx1 homozygous mutant zebrafish on day 5 (day5_ybx1-/- ) and wild-type zebrafish on days 5 and 6 (day5_ybx1+/+ and day6_ybx1+/+ ). We identified several lncRNAs affected by ybx1 disruption that may target reduction-oxidation-related genes, such as duox (NADPH oxidase) and noxo1a (NADPH oxidase organizer). Knockdown of three selected lncRNAs led to morphological deformation of larvae, implying an involvement of these lncRNAs in zebrafish embryo development. In summary, our study provides new insights into the lncRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying development in Ybx1-deficient zebrafish larvae.	2021-04	2024-03-06 20:13:22	2024-03-06T20:13:22Z		1259-1276		4	11		FEBS Open Bio								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33278865 PMCID: PMC8016120					Animals; Computational Biology; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; REDOX; RNA, Long Noncoding; Reproducibility of Results; Transcriptome; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1; YBX1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; deep RNA sequencing; long noncoding RNAs; zebrafish embryo development

The mechanisms of this endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) are poorly understood. We show that microRNA-223 (miR-223)-mediated regulation of N-glycan biosynthesis in endothelial cells (ECs) regulates EHT. miR-223 is enriched in hemECs and in oligopotent nascent HSPCs. miR-223 restricts the EHT of lymphoid-myeloid lineages by suppressing the mannosyltransferase alg2 and sialyltransferase st3gal2, two enzymes involved in protein N-glycosylation. ECs that lack miR-223 showed a decrease of high mannose versus sialylated sugars on N-glycoproteins such as the metalloprotease Adam10. EC-specific expression of an N-glycan Adam10 mutant or of the N-glycoenzymes phenocopied miR-223 mutant defects. Thus, the N-glycome is an intrinsic regulator of EHT, serving as a key determinant of the hematopoietic fate.	2020-12-04	2024-03-06 20:13:22	2024-03-06T20:13:22Z		1186-1191		6521	370		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33273096 PMCID: PMC8312266					ADAM10 Protein; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Lineage; Cell Transdifferentiation; Endothelial Cells; Genes, Reporter; Glycomics; Glycoproteins; Glycosylation; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mannosyltransferases; MicroRNAs; Polysaccharides; Sialyltransferases; Zebrafish; beta-Galactoside alpha-2,3-Sialyltransferase

Fish of the genus Danio display colour patterns ranging from horizontal stripes, to vertical bars or spots. Stripe formation in zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a self-organizing process based on cell-contact mediated interactions between three types of chromatophores with a leading role of iridophores. Here we investigate genes known to regulate chromatophore interactions in zebrafish that might have evolved to produce a pattern of vertical bars in its sibling species, Danio aesculapii. Mutant D. aesculapii indicate a lower complexity in chromatophore interactions and a minor role of iridophores in patterning. Reciprocal hemizygosity tests identify the potassium channel gene obelix/Kcnj13 as evolved between the two species. Complementation tests suggest evolutionary change through divergence in Kcnj13 function in two additional Danio species. Thus, our results point towards repeated and independent evolution of this gene during colour pattern diversification.	2020-12-04	2024-03-06 20:13:22	2024-03-06T20:13:22Z		6230		1	11		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33277491 PMCID: PMC7718271					Animals; Chromatophores; Color; Evolution, Molecular; Hybridization, Genetic; Phenotype; Pigmentation; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Species Specificity; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Hypoxia causes oxidative stress with severe and detrimental effects on brain function and acts as a critical initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). From the RNA-Seq in the forebrain (Fb), midbrain (Mb), and hindbrain (Hb) regions of hypoxic and normoxic zebrafish, we identified novel lncRNAs, whose potential cis targets showed involvement in neuronal development and differentiation pathways. Under hypoxia, several lncRNAs and mRNAs were differentially expressed. Co-expression studies indicated that the Fb and Hb regions' potential lncRNA target genes were involved in the AD pathogenesis. In contrast, those in Mb (cry1b, per1a, cipca) was responsible for regulating circadian rhythm. We identified specific lncRNAs present in the syntenic regions between zebrafish and humans, possibly functionally conserved. We thus identified several conserved lncRNAs as the probable regulators of AD genes (adrb3b, cav1, stat3, bace2, apoeb, psen1, s100b).	2021-01	2024-03-06 20:13:21	2024-03-06T20:13:21Z		29-43		1 Pt 1	113		Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33264657					Alzheimer's disease; Animals; Brain; Brain regions; Hypoxia; Long non-coding RNAs; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; RNA, Long Noncoding; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In this study, we show that the gene cellular communication network factor 2a (ccn2a), previously known as ctgfa, is induced in endocardial cells in the injured tissue and regulates CM proliferation and repopulation of the damaged tissue. We find that, whereas in wild-type animals, CMs track along the newly formed blood vessels that revascularize the injured tissue, in ccn2a mutants CM proliferation and repopulation are disrupted, despite apparently unaffected revascularization. In addition, we find that ccn2a overexpression enhances CM proliferation and improves the resolution of transient collagen deposition. Through loss- and gain-of-function as well as pharmacological approaches, we provide evidence that Ccn2a is necessary for and promotes heart regeneration by enhancing the expression of pro-regenerative extracellular matrix genes, and by inhibiting the chemokine receptor gene cxcr3.1 through a mechanism involving Tgfβ/pSmad3 signaling. Thus, Ccn2a positively modulates the innate regenerative response of the adult zebrafish heart.	2021-01-18	2024-03-06 20:13:21	2024-03-06T20:13:21Z		dev193219		2	148		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33234717 PMCID: PMC7847265					Animals; Ccn2a; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Connective Tissue Growth Factor; Coronary Vessels; Ctgf; Endocardium; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular matrix; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart; Heart regeneration; Mutation; Myocytes, Cardiac; Phosphorylation; Protein Transport; Regeneration; Smad Proteins; TGFβ; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

We demonstrate that supt16h, a component of the Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, is required for HSPC formation. Zebrafish supt16h mutants express reduced levels of Notch-signalling components, genes essential for HSPC development, due to abrogated transcription. Whereas global chromatin accessibility in supt16h mutants is not substantially altered, we observe a specific increase in p53 accessibility, causing an accumulation of p53. We further demonstrate that p53 influences expression of the Polycomb-group protein PHC1, which functions as a transcriptional repressor of Notch genes. Suppression of phc1 or its upstream regulator, p53, rescues the loss of both Notch and HSPC phenotypes in supt16h mutants. Our results highlight a relationship between supt16h, p53 and phc1 to specify HSPCs via modulation of Notch signalling.	2020-12	2024-03-06 20:13:21	2024-03-06T20:13:21Z		1411-1422		12	22		Nat Cell Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33230303 PMCID: PMC8092813					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Cycle Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Ontology; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mutation; Polycomb Repressive Complex 1; Receptors, Notch; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The versatility of microglia has long been attributed to heterogeneity. Recent studies have revealed possible heterogeneity in human but not in murine microglia, yet a firm demonstration linking microglial heterogeneity to functional phenotypes remains scarce. Here, we identified two distinct microglial populations in adult zebrafish that differ in morphology, distribution, development, and function. The predominant population, phagocytotic microglia, which expresses ccl34b.1, is broadly distributed, amoeboid in shape, highly mobile, and phagocytotic. The other white matter-enriched ccl34b.1- population, regulatory microglia, has ramified protrusions but has limited mobility and phagocytosis capability. These functional differences are further supported by distinct transcriptomes and responses to bacterial infection, where ccl34b.1+ microglia function in tissue clearance and ccl34b.1- microglia release immune regulators. Our study sheds light on the heterogeneity and functional diversification of microglia.	2020-11	2024-03-06 20:13:20	2024-03-06T20:13:20Z		eabd1160		47	6		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33208372 PMCID: PMC7673811					Animals; Mice; Microglia; Phagocytosis; White Matter; Zebrafish

In current study, we use a mvp knockout zebrafish line recently generated to characterize the function of MVP during organ regeneration. We found the regenerative capacity of heart, spinal cord and fin is preserved in mvp knockout zebrafish. Further experiments demonstrated in injured mvp knockout zebrafish, the cell death is enhanced while the transcriptome landscape is largely unchanged. These data showed MVP acts as an anti-apoptotic factor at early phase of injury response while plays a dispensable role in the regenerative programs in zebrafish.	2020-11	2024-03-06 20:13:20	2024-03-06T20:13:20Z		e05422		11	6		Heliyon								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33195847 PMCID: PMC7644919					Anti-apoptotic effect; Biological sciences; Cell biology; Cell death; Developmental genetics; Knockout; Major vault protein; Regeneration; Regenerative medicine; Zebrafish

Optimized design of antisense oligomers for targeted rRNA depletion	Nucleic Acids Research		1362-4962	10.1093/nar/gkaa1072		RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is extensively used to quantify gene expression transcriptome-wide. Although often paired with polyadenylate (poly(A)) selection to enrich for messenger RNA (mRNA), many applications require alternate approaches to counteract the high proportion of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in total RNA. Recently, digestion using RNaseH and antisense DNA oligomers tiling target rRNAs has emerged as an alternative to commercial rRNA depletion kits. Here, we present a streamlined, more economical RNaseH-mediated rRNA depletion with substantially lower up-front costs, using shorter antisense oligos only sparsely tiled along the target RNA in a 5-min digestion reaction. We introduce a novel Web tool, Oligo-ASST, that simplifies oligo design to target regions with optimal thermodynamic properties, and additionally can generate compact, common oligo pools that simultaneously target divergent RNAs, e.g. across different species. We demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies by generating rRNA-depletion oligos for Xenopus laevis and for zebrafish, which expresses two distinct versions of rRNAs during embryogenesis. The resulting RNA-seq libraries reduce rRNA to <5% of aligned reads, on par with poly(A) selection, and also reveal expression of many non-adenylated RNA species. Oligo-ASST is freely available at https://mtleelab.pitt.edu/oligo to design antisense oligos for any taxon or to target any abundant RNA for depletion.	2021-01-11	2024-03-06 20:13:20	2024-03-06T20:13:20Z		e5		1	49		Nucleic Acids Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33221877 PMCID: PMC7797071					Animals; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Internet; Male; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense; Poly A; RNA; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Ribosomal; Ribonuclease H; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Xenopus laevis; Zebrafish																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

We discovered a layer of this molecular specialization by revealing that the vertebrate retina expresses the largest number of tissue-enriched microexons of all tissue types. A subset of these microexons is included exclusively in photoreceptor transcripts, particularly in genes involved in cilia biogenesis and vesicle-mediated transport. This microexon program is regulated by Srrm3, a paralog of the neural microexon regulator Srrm4. Despite the fact that both proteins positively regulate retina microexons in vitro, only Srrm3 is highly expressed in mature photoreceptors. Its deletion in zebrafish results in widespread down-regulation of microexon inclusion from early developmental stages, followed by other transcriptomic alterations, severe photoreceptor defects, and blindness. These results shed light on the transcriptomic specialization and functionality of photoreceptors, uncovering unique cell type-specific roles for Srrm3 and microexons with implications for retinal diseases.	2022-07-19	2024-03-06 20:17:54	2024-03-06T20:17:54Z		e2117090119		29	119		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35858306 PMCID: PMC9303857					Animals; Exons; Gene Deletion; Humans; Proteins; Retinal Photoreceptor Cell Outer Segment; Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors; Transcriptome; Vision, Ocular; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; alternative splicing; retinal disease model; zebrafish

X-linked myotubular myopathy is associated with epigenetic alterations and is ameliorated by HDAC inhibition	Acta Neuropathologica		1432-0533	10.1007/s00401-022-02468-7		X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a fatal neuromuscular disorder caused by loss of function mutations in MTM1. At present, there are no directed therapies for XLMTM, and incomplete understanding of disease pathomechanisms. To address these knowledge gaps, we performed a drug screen in mtm1 mutant zebrafish and identified four positive hits, including valproic acid, which functions as a potent suppressor of the mtm1 zebrafish phenotype via HDAC inhibition. We translated these findings to a mouse XLMTM model, and showed that valproic acid ameliorates the murine phenotype. These observations led us to interrogate the epigenome in Mtm1 knockout mice; we found increased DNA methylation, which is normalized with valproic acid, and likely mediated through aberrant 1-carbon metabolism. Finally, we made the unexpected observation that XLMTM patients share a distinct DNA methylation signature, suggesting that epigenetic alteration is a conserved disease feature amenable to therapeutic intervention.	2022-09	2024-03-06 20:17:53	2024-03-06T20:17:53Z		537-563		3	144		Acta Neuropathol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35844027 PMCID: PMC9381459					Animals; Congenital myopathies; Disease Models, Animal; Drug discovery; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetics; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal; Myopathies, Structural, Congenital; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Non-Receptor; Valproic Acid; X-linked myotubular myopathy; Zebrafish

Since then, investigation of calcium dynamics in liver explants and culture has greatly increased our understanding of calcium signaling. A bottleneck, however, exists in observing calcium dynamics in a noninvasive manner because of the optical inaccessibility of the mammalian liver. Here, we aimed to take advantage of the transparency of the zebrafish larvae to image hepatocyte calcium dynamics in vivo at cellular resolution. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We developed a transgenic model expressing a calcium sensor, GCaMP6s, specifically in zebrafish hepatocytes. Using this, we provide a quantitative assessment of intracellular calcium dynamics during multiple contexts, including growth, feeding, ethanol-induced stress, and cell ablation. Specifically, we show that synchronized calcium oscillations are present in vivo , which are lost upon starvation. Starvation induces lipid accumulation in the liver. Feeding recommences calcium waves in the liver, but in a spatially restricted manner, as well as resolves starvation-induced hepatic steatosis. By using a genetically encoded scavenger for calcium, we show that dampening of calcium signaling accelerates the accumulation of starvation-related lipid droplets in the liver. Furthermore, ethanol treatment, as well as cell ablation, induces calcium flux, but with different dynamics. The former causes asynchronous calcium oscillations, whereas the latter leads to a single calcium spike. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the presence of oscillations, waves, and spikes in vivo . Calcium waves are present in response to nutrition and negatively regulate starvation-induced accumulation of lipid droplets.	2023-03-01	2024-03-06 20:17:53	2024-03-06T20:17:53Z		789-801		3	77		Hepatology								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35829917					Animals; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Ethanol; Hepatocytes; Liver; Mammals; Starvation; Zebrafish

We have developed iCodon ( www.iCodon.org ), an algorithm for customizing mRNA expression through the introduction of synonymous codon substitutions into the coding sequence. iCodon is optimized for four vertebrate transcriptomes: mouse, human, frog, and fish. Users can predict the mRNA stability of any coding sequence based on its codon composition and subsequently generate more stable (optimized) or unstable (deoptimized) variants encoding for the same protein. Further, we show that codon optimality predictions correlate with both mRNA stability using a massive reporter library and expression levels using fluorescent reporters and analysis of endogenous gene expression in zebrafish embryos and/or human cells. Therefore, iCodon will benefit basic biological research, as well as a wide range of applications for biotechnology and biomedicine.	2022-07-15	2024-03-06 20:17:53	2024-03-06T20:17:53Z		12126		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35840631 PMCID: PMC9287306					Animals; Codon; Humans; Mice; Protein Biosynthesis; Proteins; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Zebrafish

Genome-wide transcriptomic changes reveal the genetic pathways involved in insect migration	Molecular Ecology		1365-294X	10.1111/mec.16588		Insects are capable of extraordinary feats of long-distance movement that have profound impacts on the function of terrestrial ecosystems. The ability to undertake these movements arose multiple times through the evolution of a suite of traits that make up the migratory syndrome, however the underlying genetic pathways involved remain poorly understood. Migratory hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are an emerging model group for studies of migration. They undertake seasonal movements in huge numbers across large parts of the globe and are important pollinators, biological control agents and decomposers. Here, we assembled a high-quality draft genome of the marmalade hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus). We leveraged this genomic resource to undertake a genome-wide transcriptomic comparison of actively migrating Episyrphus, captured from a high mountain pass as they flew south to overwinter, with the transcriptomes of summer forms which were non-migratory. We identified 1543 genes with very strong evidence for differential expression. Interrogation of this gene set reveals a remarkable range of roles in metabolism, muscle structure and function, hormonal regulation, immunity, stress resistance, flight and feeding behaviour, longevity, reproductive diapause and sensory perception. These features of the migrant phenotype have arisen by the integration and modification of pathways such as insulin signalling for diapause and longevity, JAK/SAT for immunity, and those leading to octopamine production and fuelling to boost flight capabilities. Our results provide a powerful genomic resource for future research, and paint a comprehensive picture of global expression changes in an actively migrating insect, identifying key genomic components involved in this important life-history strategy.	2022-08	2024-03-06 20:17:52	2024-03-06T20:17:52Z		4332-4350		16	31		Mol Ecol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35801824 PMCID: PMC9546057					Animal Migration; Animals; Diptera; Ecosystem; Insecta; Phenotype; Transcriptome; differential gene expression; genetics of migration; insect migration; migratory hoverflies; molecular adaptations; syrphidae

The analysis of niche cells or stromal cell lines that can support HSCs has facilitated the finding of novel supporting factors for HSCs. Despite large efforts in the murine bone marrow; however, HSC expansion is still difficult ex vivo, highlighting the need for new approaches to elucidate the molecular elements that regulate HSCs. The zebrafish provides a unique model to study hematopoietic niches as HSCs are maintained in the kidney, allowing for a parallel view of hematopoietic niches over evolution. Here, using a stromal cell line from the zebrafish kidney, zebrafish kidney stromal (ZKS), we uncover that an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, IWR-1-endo, is a potent regulator of HSCs. Coculture assays revealed that ZKS cells were in part supportive of maintenance, but not expansion, of gata2a:GFP+runx1:mCherry+ (gata2a+runx1+) HSCs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that, compared with candidate niche cells in the kidney, ZKS cells weakly expressed HSC maintenance factor genes, thpo and cxcl12, but highly expressed canonical Wnt ligand genes, wnt1, 7bb, and 9a. Thpo supplementation in ZKS culture slightly increased, but inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by IWR-1-endo treatment largely increased the number of gata2a+runx1+ cells (>2-fold). Moreover, we found that gata2a+runx1+ cells can be maintained by supplementing both IWR-1-endo and Thpo without stromal cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence that IWR-1-endo can be used as a novel supporting factor for HSCs.	2022-09-26	2024-03-06 20:17:52	2024-03-06T20:17:52Z		831-842		9	40		Stem Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35759948					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Ligands; Mice; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Zebrafish; canonical Wnt signaling; hematopoietic stem cell; kidney; stromal cell; zebrafish

However, our knowledge about evolutionary conservation of localized transcripts is still limited to a few models. Our goal was to compare localization profiles along the animal-vegetal axis of mature eggs from four vertebrate models, two amphibians (Xenopus laevis, Ambystoma mexicanum) and two fishes (Acipenser ruthenus, Danio rerio) using the spatial expression method called TOMO-Seq. We revealed that RNAs of many known important transcripts such as germ layer determinants, germ plasm factors and members of key signalling pathways, are localized in completely different profiles among the models. It was also observed that there was a poor correlation between the vegetally localized transcripts but a relatively good correlation between the animally localized transcripts. These findings indicate that the regulation of embryonic development within the animal kingdom is highly diverse and cannot be deduced based on a single model.	2022-09	2024-03-06 20:17:52	2024-03-06T20:17:52Z		146-160			489		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35752299					Amphibians; Animals; Biological Evolution; Egg; Fishes; Oocytes; RNA; RNA localization; TOMO-Seq; Xenopus laevis; Zebrafish; evo devo

Nevertheless, the developmental toxicity and potential mechanism of SYP-3343 have not been well-documented. The results showed that SYP-3343 was relatively stable and maintained within the range of 20 % in 24 h, and the LC50 value to embryos at 72 hpf was 17.13 μg/L. The zebrafish embryotoxicity induced by 1, 2, 4, and 8 μg/L SYP-3343 is demonstrated by repressive embryo incubation, enhancive mortality rate, abnormal heart rate, malformed morphological characteristic, and impaired spontaneous coiling, indicating SYP-3343 mostly exerted its toxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides SYP-3343 was critically involved in regulating cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species production as well as zebrafish primary cells apoptosis, which can be mitigated using antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. A significant change occurred in total protein content, the biochemical indices, and antioxidant capacities owing to SYP-3343 exposure. Additionally, SYP-3343 altered the mRNA levels of heart development-, mitochondrial function-, and apoptosis-related genes in zebrafish embryos. These results indicated that SYP-3343 induced apoptosis accompanying reactive oxygen species-initiated mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish embryos.	2022-09-05	2024-03-06 20:17:52	2024-03-06T20:17:52Z		129382			437		J Hazard Mater								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35749898					Animals; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reactive oxygen species; SYP-3343; Zebrafish

Here we report that SMCHD1, a chromatin-modifying enzyme needed for X-inactivation in mammals, is maternally required for timely HOX expression. Using zebrafish and mouse Smchd1 knockout animals, we demonstrate that Smchd1 haplo-insufficiency brings about precocious and ectopic HOX transcription during oogenesis and embryogenesis. Unexpectedly, wild-type offspring born to heterozygous knockout zebrafish smchd1 mothers exhibited patent vertebrate patterning defects. The loss of maternal Smchd1 was accompanied by HOX epi-mutations driven by aberrant DNA methylation. We further show that this regulation is mediated by Lrif1, a direct interacting partner of Smchd1, whose knockout in zebrafish phenocopies that of Smchd1. Rather than being a short-lived maternal effect, HOX mis-regulation is stably inherited through cell divisions and persists in cultured fibroblasts derived from FSHD2 patients haploinsufficient for SMCHD1. We conclude that maternal SMCHD1/LRIF1 sets up an epigenetic state in the HOX loci that can only be reset in the germline. Such an unusual inter-generational inheritance, whereby a phenotype can be one generation removed from its genotype, casts a new light on how unresolved Mendelian diseases may be interpreted.	2022-06-23	2024-03-06 20:17:51	2024-03-06T20:17:51Z		3583		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35739109 PMCID: PMC9226161					Animals; Chromatin; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genes, Homeobox; Haploinsufficiency; Humans; Mice; Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of neuroepithelial cells and other cell types of the gills of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to hypoxia	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-022-13693-1		The fish gill is a multifunctional organ involved in numerous physiological processes, such as gas exchange and sensing of hypoxia by respiratory chemoreceptors, called neuroepithelial cells (NECs). Many studies have focused on zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the structure, function and development of the gills, yet the transcriptomic profile of most gill cells remains obscure. We present the results of a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the gills of zebrafish using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Gill cells from ETvmat2:EGFP zebrafish were individually labelled before scRNA-seq library construction using 10× Genomics Chromium technology. 12,819 cells were sequenced with an average depth of over 27,000 reads per cell. We identified a median of 485 genes per cell and 16 cell clusters, including NECs, neurons, pavement cells, endothelial cells and mitochondrion-rich cells. The identity of NECs was confirmed by expression of slc18a2, encoding the vesicular monoamine transporter, Vmat2. Highly differentially-expressed genes in NECs included tph1a, encoding tryptophan hydroxylase, sv2 (synaptic vesicle protein), and proteins implicated in O2 sensing (ndufa4l2a, cox8al and epas1a). In addition, NECs and neurons expressed genes encoding transmembrane receptors for serotonergic, cholinergic or dopaminergic neurotransmission. Differential expression analysis showed a clear shift in the transcriptome of NECs following 14 days of acclimation to hypoxia. NECs in the hypoxia group showed high expression of genes involved in cell cycle control and proliferation. The present article provides a complete cell atlas for the zebrafish gill and serves as a platform for future studies investigating the molecular biology and physiology of this organ.	2022-06-16	2024-03-06 20:17:51	2024-03-06T20:17:51Z		10144		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35710785 PMCID: PMC9203529					Animals; Endothelial Cells; Gills; Hypoxia; Neuroepithelial Cells; Oxygen; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

The Olfactory Organ Is a Unique Site for Neutrophils in the Brain	Frontiers in Immunology		1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2022.881702		In the vertebrate olfactory tract new neurons are continuously produced throughout life. It is widely believed that neurogenesis contributes to learning and memory and can be regulated by immune signaling molecules. Proteins originally identified in the immune system have subsequently been localized to the developing and adult nervous system. Previously, we have shown that olfactory imprinting, a specific type of long-term memory, is correlated with a transcriptional response in the olfactory organs that include up-regulation of genes associated with the immune system. To better understand the immune architecture of the olfactory organs we made use of cell-specific fluorescent reporter lines in dissected, intact adult brains of zebrafish to examine the association of the olfactory sensory neurons with neutrophils and blood-lymphatic vasculature. Surprisingly, the olfactory organs contained the only neutrophil populations observed in the brain; these neutrophils were localized in the neural epithelia and were associated with the extensive blood vasculature of the olfactory organs. Damage to the olfactory epithelia resulted in a rapid increase of neutrophils both within the olfactory organs as well as the central nervous system. Analysis of cell division during and after damage showed an increase in BrdU labeling in the neural epithelia and a subset of the neutrophils. Our results reveal a unique population of neutrophils in the olfactory organs that are associated with both the olfactory epithelia and the lymphatic vasculature suggesting a dual olfactory-immune function for this unique sensory system.	2022	2024-03-06 20:17:51	2024-03-06T20:17:51Z		881702			13		Front Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35693773 PMCID: PMC9186071					Animals; Neutrophils; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Mucosa; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Zebrafish; bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU); mpx:Dendra2; neutrophil brain migration; olfactory Bulb (OB); olfactory imprinting; olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)

Understanding how heart regeneration occurs in these contexts can help illuminate cellular and molecular events that can be targets for heart failure prevention or treatment. The epicardium, a mesothelial tissue layer that encompasses the heart, is a dynamic structure that is essential for cardiac regeneration in zebrafish. The extent to which different cell subpopulations or states facilitate heart regeneration requires research attention. METHODS: To dissect epicardial cell states and associated proregenerative functions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and identified 7 epicardial cell clusters in adult zebrafish, 3 of which displayed enhanced cell numbers during regeneration. We identified paralogs of hapln1 as factors associated with the extracellular matrix and largely expressed in cluster 1. We assessed HAPLN1 expression in published single-cell RNA sequencing data sets from different stages and injury states of murine and human hearts, and we performed molecular genetics to determine the requirements for hapln1-expressing cells and functions of each hapln1 paralog. RESULTS: A particular cluster of epicardial cells had the strongest association with regeneration and was marked by expression of hapln1a and hapln1b. The hapln1 paralogs are expressed in epicardial cells that enclose dedifferentiated and proliferating cardiomyocytes during regeneration. Induced genetic depletion of hapln1-expressing cells or genetic inactivation of hapln1b altered deposition of the key extracellular matrix component hyaluronic acid, disrupted cardiomyocyte proliferation, and inhibited heart regeneration. We also found that hapln1-expressing epicardial cells first emerge at the juvenile stage, when they associate with and are required for focused cardiomyocyte expansion events that direct maturation of the ventricular wall. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify a subset of epicardial cells that emerge in postembryonic zebrafish and sponsor regions of active cardiomyogenesis during cardiac growth and regeneration. We provide evidence that, as the heart achieves its mature structure, these cells facilitate hyaluronic acid deposition to support formation of the compact muscle layer of the ventricle. They are also required, along with the function of hapln1b paralog, in the production and organization of hyaluronic acid-containing matrix in cardiac injury sites, enabling normal cardiomyocyte proliferation and muscle regeneration.	2022-07-05	2024-03-06 20:17:50	2024-03-06T20:17:50Z		48-63		1	146		Circulation								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35652354 PMCID: PMC9308751					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Heart; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organogenesis; Proteoglycans; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; epicardium; extracellular matrix; heart; hyaluronic acid; myocytes, cardiac; regeneration; zebrafish

Shortly after invasion by the plasmid, pEGFP-N1, the conserved the defense gene, isg15, was activated in the zebrafish zygote and in mammalian cells. Based on the sequence similarity, we found three virus-derived sequences in pEGFP-N1 which share the 5'-GTTTGTT-3' core sequence, an epigenetic factor leading to increased expression of isg15.

However, the de-tailed biological mechanisms and significance by which the effects of fasting confer health benefits are not yet clear. Due to certain advantages of the zebrafish as a vertebrate model, it is widely utilized in biological studies. However, the biological responses to nutrient metabolism within zebrafish skeletal muscles have not yet been amply reported. Therefore, we aimed to reveal a gene expression profile in zebrafish skeletal muscles in response to fasting-refeeding. Accordingly, mRNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed to examine comprehensive gene expression changes in skeletal muscle tissues during fasting-refeeding. Our results produced a novel set of nutrition-related genes under a fasting-refeeding protocol. Moreover, we found that five genes were dramatically upregulated in each fasting (for 24 h) and refeeding (after 3 h), exhibiting a rapid response to the provided conditional changes. The assessment of the gene length revealed that the gene set whose expression was elevated only after 3 h of refeeding had a shorter length, suggesting that nutrition-related gene function is associated with gene length. Taken together, our results from the bioinformatics analyses provide new insights into biological mechanisms induced by fasting-refeeding conditions within zebrafish skeletal muscle.	2022-05-27	2024-03-06 20:17:50	2024-03-06T20:17:50Z		2239		11	14		Nutrients								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35684038 PMCID: PMC9182819					Animals; Fasting; Muscle, Skeletal; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; fasting; gene length; mRNA-sequencing; refeeding; skeletal muscle; zebrafish

Contrary to humans, a zebrafish can regenerate its diseased brain, and thus is ideal for studying neurogenesis. To compare the AD-related molecular pathways between humans and zebrafish, we compared single cell or nuclear transcriptomic data from a zebrafish amyloid toxicity model and its controls (N = 12) with the datasets of two human adult brains (N = 10 and N = 48 (Microglia)), and one fetal brain (N = 10). Approximately 95.4% of the human and zebrafish cells co-clustered. Within each cell type, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched KEGG pathways, and gene ontology terms. We studied synergistic and non-synergistic DEGs to point at either common or uniquely altered mechanisms across species. Using the top DEGs, a high concordance in gene expression changes between species was observed in neuronal clusters. On the other hand, the molecular pathways affected by AD in zebrafish astroglia differed from humans in favor of the neurogenic pathways. The integration of zebrafish and human transcriptomes shows that the zebrafish can be used as a tool to study the cellular response to amyloid proteinopathies. Uniquely altered pathways in zebrafish could highlight the specific mechanisms underlying neurogenesis, which are absent in humans, and could serve as potential candidates for therapeutic developments.	2022-05-31	2024-03-06 20:17:50	2024-03-06T20:17:50Z		1807		11	11		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35681503 PMCID: PMC9180693					Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Animals; Humans; Neurogenesis; Solitary Nucleus; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; adult brain; astroglia; fetal brain; human; microglia; neuroregeneration; single cell RNA sequencing; single nuclear RNA sequencing; telencephalon; zebrafish

Yet the precise mechanism underlying MZT remains largely unknown. Here we report that the RNA helicase Ddx3xb in zebrafish undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and an increase in ATP content promotes the condensation of Ddx3xb during MZT. Mutant form of Ddx3xb losing LLPS ability fails to rescue the developmental defect of Ddx3xb-deficient embryos. Interestingly, the IDR of either FUS or hnRNPA1 can functionally replace the N-terminal IDR in Ddx3xb. Phase separation of Ddx3xb facilitates the unwinding of 5' UTR structures of maternal mRNAs to enhance their translation. Our study reveals an unprecedent mechanism whereby the Ddx3xb phase separation regulates MZT by promoting maternal mRNA translation.	2022-08	2024-03-06 20:17:50	2024-03-06T20:17:50Z		715-728		8	32		Cell Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35661831 PMCID: PMC9343644					Animals; DNA Helicases; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; RNA, Messenger, Stored; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

However, the molecular mechanisms by which temperature affects sex determination remains unclear, although a few candidate genes have been found to play a role in the process. In this study, we conducted transcriptome analysis of the effects induced by high temperature on zebrafish during gonad differentiation period. RESULTS: Totals of 1171, 1022 and 2921 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high temperature and normal temperature were identified at 35, 45 and 60 days post-fertilization (dpf) respectively, revealing that heat shock proteins (HSPs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were involved in the heat-exposed sex reversal. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway that were enriched in individuals after heat treatment included Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, cell cycle, oocyte meiosis and homologous recombination. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the results of comparative transcriptome analyses between high temperature and normal temperature, and reveals that the molecular mechanism of heat-induced masculinization in zebrafish is strongly related to the expression of HSPs and DNMTs and FA pathway during gonad differentiation.	2022-05-31	2024-03-06 20:17:49	2024-03-06T20:17:49Z		39		1	23		BMC Genom Data								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35641933 PMCID: PMC9158171					Animals; FA pathway; Fanconi Anemia; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Gonad differentiation; Gonads; Heat stress; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Their role as functional carrier of bioactive molecules is boosted by cells that actively secrete them in biological fluids or in the intercellular space (interstitial EVs, iEVs). Here we have optimised a method for the isolation and characterization of zebrafish iEVs from whole melanoma tissues. Zebrafish melanoma iEVs are around 140 nm in diameter, as determined by nanoparticle tracking and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Western blot analysis shows enrichment for CD63 and Alix in the iEV fraction, but not in melanoma cell lysates. Super resolution and confocal microscopy reveal that purified zebrafish iEVs are green fluorescent protein positive (GFP+), indicating that they integrate the oncogene GFP-HRASV12G used to induce melanoma in this model within their vesicular membrane or luminal content. Analysis of RNA-Seq data found 118 non-coding (nc)RNAs differentially distributed between zebrafish melanoma and their iEVs, with only 17 of them being selectively enriched in iEVs. Among these, the RNA components of RNAses P and MRP, which process ribosomal RNA precursors, mitochondrial RNAs, and some mRNAs, were enriched in zebrafish and human melanoma EVs, but not in iEVs extracted from brain tumours. We found that melanoma iEVs induce an inflammatory response when injected in larvae, with increased expression of interferon responsive genes, and this effect is reproduced by MRP- or P-RNAs injected into circulation. This suggests that zebrafish melanoma iEVs are a source of MRP- and P-RNAs that can trigger inflammation in cells of the innate immune system.	2022-05-14	2024-03-06 20:17:49	2024-03-06T20:17:49Z		5510		10	23		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35628321 PMCID: PMC9143139					Animals; Extracellular Vesicles; Inflammation; Melanoma; P and MRP RNAse; RNA, Untranslated; Zebrafish; danio rerio; exosomes/extracellular vesicles; long ncRNA; melanoma

(2) Methods: To assess the effects of these dyes, zebrafish embryos were exposed from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) to 10-55 µM Disperse Red 9, 1-50 µM Solvent Red 169, 7.5-13.5 µM Solvent Yellow 33 or 133-314 µM Disperse Blue 14. Embryos were monitored for adverse effects on gene expression at 48 hpf as well as for mortality, development and behavior at 120 hpf. The dyes were examined for their potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. (3) Results: Solvent Yellow 33 and Disperse Blue 14 impaired development and behavior at all concentrations. Disperse Red 9 impaired behavior at all concentrations and development at all concentrations except for 10 µM. Solvent Red 169 caused no effects. Mortality was only seen in Disperse Blue 14 at 261.5 and 314 µM. Gene expression indicated impacts on neurodevelopment and folate and retinol metabolism as potential mechanisms of toxicity. (4) Conclusions: Smoke dyes have a high potential for causing developmental changes and neurotoxicity and should be examined more closely using comprehensive approaches as used here.	2022-04-22	2024-03-06 20:17:49	2024-03-06T20:17:49Z		210		5	10		Toxics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35622624 PMCID: PMC9171585					behavior; pathway; smoke dye; transcriptomics; zebrafish embryo test

In the vascular system, endothelial cells (ECs) of blood and lymphatic vessels differentiate and specialize to cater to the unique physiological demands of each organ1,2. Although lymphatic vessels were shown to derive from multiple cellular origins, lymphatic ECs (LECs) are not known to generate other cell types3,4. Here we use recurrent imaging and lineage-tracing of ECs in zebrafish anal fins, from early development to adulthood, to uncover a mechanism of specialized blood vessel formation through the transdifferentiation of LECs. Moreover, we demonstrate that deriving anal-fin vessels from lymphatic versus blood ECs results in functional differences in the adult organism, uncovering a link between cell ontogeny and functionality. We further use single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the different cellular populations and transition states involved in the transdifferentiation process. Finally, we show that, similar to normal development, the vasculature is rederived from lymphatics during anal-fin regeneration, demonstrating that LECs in adult fish retain both potency and plasticity for generating blood ECs. Overall, our research highlights an innate mechanism of blood vessel formation through LEC transdifferentiation, and provides in vivo evidence for a link between cell ontogeny and functionality in ECs.	2022-06	2024-03-06 20:17:48	2024-03-06T20:17:48Z		570-575		7914	606		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35614218 PMCID: PMC9875863					Animal Fins; Animals; Blood Vessels; Cell Lineage; Cell Transdifferentiation; Endothelial Cells; Lymphatic Vessels; Zebrafish

Single-cell transcriptome reveals insights into the development and function of the zebrafish ovary	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.76014		Zebrafish are an established research organism that has made many contributions to our understanding of vertebrate tissue and organ development, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the genes that regulate gonad development, sex, and reproduction. Unlike the development of many organs, such as the brain and heart that form during the first few days of development, zebrafish gonads do not begin to form until the larval stage (≥5 days post-fertilization). Thus, forward genetic screens have identified very few genes required for gonad development. In addition, bulk RNA-sequencing studies that identify genes expressed in the gonads do not have the resolution necessary to define minor cell populations that may play significant roles in the development and function of these organs. To overcome these limitations, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of cells isolated from juvenile zebrafish ovaries. This resulted in the profiles of 10,658 germ cells and 14,431 somatic cells. Our germ cell data represents all developmental stages from germline stem cells to early meiotic oocytes. Our somatic cell data represents all known somatic cell types, including follicle cells, theca cells, and ovarian stromal cells. Further analysis revealed an unexpected number of cell subpopulations within these broadly defined cell types. To further define their functional significance, we determined the location of these cell subpopulations within the ovary. Finally, we used gene knockout experiments to determine the roles of foxl2l and wnt9b for oocyte development and sex determination and/or differentiation, respectively. Our results reveal novel insights into zebrafish ovarian development and function, and the transcriptome profiles will provide a valuable resource for future studies.	2022-05-19	2024-03-06 20:17:48	2024-03-06T20:17:48Z		e76014			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35588359 PMCID: PMC9191896					Animals; Estrogen synthesis; Female; Gonads; Ovary; Sex Differentiation; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; developmental biology; foxl2l; germ cells; germline stem cells; ovary; sex determination; single-cell RNA sequencing; somatic gonad; wnt9b; zebrafish

Peripheral NOD-like receptor deficient inflammatory macrophages trigger neutrophil infiltration into the brain disrupting daytime locomotion	Communications Biology		2399-3642	10.1038/s42003-022-03410-z		Inflammation is known to disrupt normal behavior, yet the underlying neuroimmune interactions remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether inappropriate macrophage-evoked inflammation alters CNS control of daily-life animal locomotion using a set of zebrafish mutants selected for specific macrophage dysfunction and microglia deficiency. Large-scale genetic and computational analyses revealed that NOD-like receptor nlrc3l mutants are capable of normal motility and visuomotor response, but preferentially swim less in the daytime, suggesting possible low motivation rather than physical impairment. Examining their brain activities and structures implicates impaired dopaminergic descending circuits, where neutrophils abnormally infiltrate. Furthermore, neutrophil depletion recovered daytime locomotion. Restoring wild-type macrophages reversed behavioral and neutrophil aberrations, while three other microglia-lacking mutants failed to phenocopy nlrc3l mutants. Overall, we reveal how peripheral inflammatory macrophages with elevated pro-inflammatory cues (including il1β, tnfα, cxcl8a) in the absence of microglia co-opt neutrophils to infiltrate the brain, thereby potentially enabling local circuitry modulation affecting daytime locomotion.	2022-05-16	2024-03-06 20:17:48	2024-03-06T20:17:48Z		464		1	5		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35577844 PMCID: PMC9110401					Animals; Brain; Inflammation; Locomotion; Macrophages; NLR Proteins; Neutrophil Infiltration; Zebrafish

TFAP2 paralogs facilitate chromatin access for MITF at pigmentation and cell proliferation genes	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1010207		In developing melanocytes and in melanoma cells, multiple paralogs of the Activating-enhancer-binding Protein 2 family of transcription factors (TFAP2) contribute to expression of genes encoding pigmentation regulators, but their interaction with Microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), a master regulator of these cells, is unclear. Supporting the model that TFAP2 facilitates MITF's ability to activate expression of pigmentation genes, single-cell seq analysis of zebrafish embryos revealed that pigmentation genes are only expressed in the subset of mitfa-expressing cells that also express tfap2 paralogs. To test this model in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells we deleted the two TFAP2 paralogs with highest expression, TFAP2A and TFAP2C, creating TFAP2 knockout (TFAP2-KO) cells. We then assessed gene expression, chromatin accessibility, binding of TFAP2A and of MITF, and the chromatin marks H3K27Ac and H3K27Me3 which are characteristic of active enhancers and silenced chromatin, respectively. Integrated analyses of these datasets indicate TFAP2 paralogs directly activate enhancers near genes enriched for roles in pigmentation and proliferation, and directly repress enhancers near genes enriched for roles in cell adhesion. Consistently, compared to WT cells, TFAP2-KO cells proliferate less and adhere to one another more. TFAP2 paralogs and MITF co-operatively activate a subset of enhancers, with the former necessary for MITF binding and chromatin accessibility. By contrast, TFAP2 paralogs and MITF do not appear to co-operatively inhibit enhancers. These studies reveal a mechanism by which TFAP2 profoundly influences the set of genes activated by MITF, and thereby the phenotype of pigment cells and melanoma cells.	2022-05	2024-03-06 20:17:48	2024-03-06T20:17:48Z		e1010207		5	18		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35580127 PMCID: PMC9159589					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Microphthalmos; Pigmentation; Zebrafish

Endocardial identity is established during early somitogenesis by Bmp signalling acting upstream of npas4l and etv2	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.190421		The endocardium plays important roles in the development and function of the vertebrate heart; however, few molecular markers of this tissue have been identified and little is known about what regulates its differentiation. Here, we describe the Gt(SAGFF27C); Tg(4xUAS:egfp) line as a marker of endocardial development in zebrafish. Transcriptomic comparison between endocardium and pan-endothelium confirms molecular distinction between these populations and time-course analysis suggests differentiation as early as eight somites. To investigate what regulates endocardial identity, we employed npas4l, etv2 and scl loss-of-function models. Endocardial expression is lost in npas4l mutants, significantly reduced in etv2 mutants and only modestly affected upon scl loss-of-function. Bmp signalling was also examined: overactivation of Bmp signalling increased endocardial expression, whereas Bmp inhibition decreased expression. Finally, epistasis experiments showed that overactivation of Bmp signalling was incapable of restoring endocardial expression in etv2 mutants. By contrast, overexpression of either npas4l or etv2 was sufficient to rescue endocardial expression upon Bmp inhibition. Together, these results describe the differentiation of the endocardium, distinct from vasculature, and place npas4l and etv2 downstream of Bmp signalling in regulating its differentiation.	2022-05-01	2024-03-06 20:17:47	2024-03-06T20:17:47Z		dev190421		9	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35531980 PMCID: PMC9148566					Animals; Bmp signalling; Cardiac; Endocardium; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; etv2/etsrp; npas4l/cloche

While the hierarchical organization of heterochromatin and euchromatin can underlie differences in gene expression that determine evolutionary differences among species, the way 3D genome architecture is affected by evolutionary forces within major lineages remains unclear. Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of 3D genomes, using high resolution Hi-C data in fibroblast cells of fish, chickens, and 10 mammalian species. RESULTS: This analysis shows a correlation between genome size and chromosome length that affects chromosome territory (CT) organization in the upper hierarchy of genome architecture, whereas lower hierarchical features, including local transcriptional availability of DNA, are selected through the evolution of vertebrates. Furthermore, conservation of topologically associating domains (TADs) appears strongly associated with the modularity of expression profiles across species. Additionally, LINE and SINE transposable elements likely contribute to heterochromatin and euchromatin organization, respectively, during the evolution of genome architecture. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis uncovers organizational features that appear to determine the conservation and transcriptional regulation of functional genes across species. These findings can guide ongoing investigations of genome evolution by extending our understanding of the mechanisms shaping genome architecture.	2022-05-06	2024-03-06 20:17:47	2024-03-06T20:17:47Z		99		1	20		BMC Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35524220 PMCID: PMC9077971					Animals; Chickens; Chromatin; Chromatin architecture; DNA Transposable Elements; Euchromatin; Evolution; Gene expression; Heterochromatin; Mammals; Vertebrates

Enhancer selection dictates gene expression responses in remote organs during tissue regeneration	Nature Cell Biology		1476-4679	10.1038/s41556-022-00906-y		Acute trauma stimulates local repair mechanisms but can also impact structures distant from the injury, for example through the activity of circulating factors. To study the responses of remote tissues during tissue regeneration, we profiled transcriptomes of zebrafish brains after experimental cardiac damage. We found that the transcription factor gene cebpd was upregulated remotely in brain ependymal cells as well as kidney tubular cells, in addition to its local induction in epicardial cells. cebpd mutations altered both local and distant cardiac injury responses, altering the cycling of epicardial cells as well as exchange between distant fluid compartments. Genome-wide profiling and transgenesis identified a hormone-responsive enhancer near cebpd that exists in a permissive state, enabling rapid gene expression in heart, brain and kidney after cardiac injury. Deletion of this sequence selectively abolished cebpd induction in remote tissues and disrupted fluid regulation after injury, without affecting its local cardiac expression response. Our findings suggest a model to broaden gene function during regeneration in which enhancer regulatory elements define short- and long-range expression responses to injury.	2022-05	2024-03-06 20:17:47	2024-03-06T20:17:47Z		685-696		5	24		Nat Cell Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35513710 PMCID: PMC9107506					Animals; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Sinhcaf is a recently identified subunit of the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex (SIN3A-HDAC). Here, we provide evidence that Sinhcaf-dependent histone deacetylation is essential for germ plasm aggregation and primordial germ cell specification. Specifically, maternal-zygotic sinhcaf zebrafish mutants exhibit germ plasm aggregation defects, decreased PGC abundance and male-biased sex ratio, which can be rescued by re-expressing sinhcaf. Overexpression of sinhcaf results in excess PGCs and a female-biased sex ratio. Sinhcaf binds to the promoter region of kif26ab. Loss of sinhcaf epigenetically switches off kif26ab expression by increasing histone 3 acetylation in the promoter region. Injection of kif26ab mRNA could partially rescue the germ plasm aggregation defects in sinhcaf mutant embryos. Taken together, we demonstrate a role of Sinhcaf in germ plasm aggregation and PGC specialization that is mediated by regulating the histone acetylation status of the kif26ab promoter to activate its transcription.

Here, we generate quantitative mRNA m5C maps at different stages of development in 6 vertebrate and invertebrate species and find convergent and unexpected massive methylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by NSUN2 and NSUN6. Using Drosophila as a model, we reveal that embryos lacking maternal mRNA m5C undergo cell cycle delays and fail to timely initiate maternal-to-zygotic transition, implying the functional importance of maternal mRNA m5C. From invertebrates to the lineage leading to humans, two waves of m5C regulatory innovations are observed: higher animals gain cis-directed NSUN2-mediated m5C sites at the 5' end of the mRNAs, accompanied by the emergence of more structured 5'UTR regions; humans gain thousands of trans-directed NSUN6-mediated m5C sites enriched in genes regulating the mitotic cell cycle. Collectively, our studies highlight the existence and regulatory innovations of a mechanism of early embryonic development and provide key resources for elucidating the role of mRNA m5C in biology and disease.	2022-05-05	2024-03-06 20:17:46	2024-03-06T20:17:46Z		2484		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35513466 PMCID: PMC9072368					Animals; Drosophila; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Methylation; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Messenger, Stored; Zygote

Highly selective RET inhibitors have recently entered clinical use after demonstrating efficacy in treating patients with diverse tumor types harboring RET gene rearrangements or activating mutations. In order to understand resistance mechanisms arising after treatment with RET inhibitors, we performed a comprehensive molecular and genomic analysis of a patient with RET-rearranged thyroid cancer. Using a combination of drug screening and proteomic and biochemical profiling, we identified an adaptive resistance to RET inhibitors that reactivates ERK signaling within hours of drug exposure. We found that activation of FGFR signaling is a mechanism of adaptive resistance to RET inhibitors that activates ERK signaling. Combined inhibition of FGFR and RET prevented the development of adaptive resistance to RET inhibitors, reduced cell viability, and decreased tumor growth in cellular and animal models of CCDC6-RET-rearranged thyroid cancer.	2022-06-06	2024-03-06 20:17:46	2024-03-06T20:17:46Z		e20210390		6	219		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35510953 PMCID: PMC9082625					Animals; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Thyroid Neoplasms

Here, we demonstrate the oncogenicity of IRF4 in vivo, its potential effects on T-cell development and clonal evolution using a zebrafish model. IRF4-transgenic zebrafish develop aggressive tumors with massive infiltration of abnormal lymphocytes that spread to distal organs. Many late-stage tumors are mono- or oligoclonal, and tumor cells can expand in recipient animals after transplantation, demonstrating their malignancy. Mutation of p53 accelerates tumor onset, increases penetrance, and results in tumor heterogeneity. Surprisingly, single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals that the majority of tumor cells are double-negative T-cells, many of which express tcr-γ that became dominant as the tumors progress, whereas double-positive T-cells are largely diminished. Gene expression and epigenetic profiling demonstrates that gata3, mycb, lrrn1, patl1 and psip1 are specifically activated in tumors, while genes responsible for T-cell differentiation including id3 are repressed. IRF4-driven tumors are sensitive to the BRD inhibitor.	2022-05-03	2024-03-06 20:17:45	2024-03-06T20:17:45Z		2420		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35504924 PMCID: PMC9065160					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Clonal Evolution; Lymphoma; Lymphoma, T-Cell; Zebrafish

Notch signaling is crucial for HSPC generation across vertebrates; however, the precise control of Notch during this process remains unclear. In the present study, we used multi-omics approaches together with functional assays to assess global DNA methylome dynamics during the endothelial cells to HSPCs transition in zebrafish, and determined that DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is essential for HSPC generation via repression of Notch signaling. Depletion of dnmt1 resulted in decreased DNA methylation levels and impaired HSPC production. Mechanistically, we found that loss of dnmt1 induced hypomethylation of Notch genes and consequently elevated Notch activity in hemogenic endothelial cells, thereby repressing the generation of HSPCs. This finding deepens our understanding of HSPC specification in vivo, which will provide helpful insights for designing new strategies for HSPC generation in vitro.	2022-05-15	2024-03-06 20:17:45	2024-03-06T20:17:45Z		dev200390		10	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35502759 PMCID: PMC9188753					Animals; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Dnmt1; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; Notch; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Elizabeth	Aldh2 is a lineage-specific metabolic gatekeeper in melanocyte stem cells	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.200277		Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) in zebrafish serve as an on-demand source of melanocytes during growth and regeneration, but metabolic programs associated with their activation and regenerative processes are not well known. Here, using live imaging coupled with scRNA-sequencing, we discovered that, during regeneration, quiescent McSCs activate a dormant embryonic neural crest transcriptional program followed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) 2 metabolic switch to generate progeny. Unexpectedly, although ALDH2 is well known for its aldehyde-clearing mechanisms, we find that, in regenerating McSCs, Aldh2 activity is required to generate formate - the one-carbon (1C) building block for nucleotide biosynthesis - through formaldehyde metabolism. Consequently, we find that disrupting the 1C cycle with low doses of methotrexate causes melanocyte regeneration defects. In the absence of Aldh2, we find that purines are the metabolic end product sufficient for activated McSCs to generate progeny. Together, our work reveals McSCs undergo a two-step cell state transition during regeneration, and that the reaction products of Aldh2 enzymes have tissue-specific stem cell functions that meet metabolic demands in regeneration.	2022-05-15	2024-03-06 20:17:45	2024-03-06T20:17:45Z		dev200277		10	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35485397 PMCID: PMC9188749					Aldh2; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Formaldehyde; Melanocyte stem cell; Melanocytes; Metabolism; Neural Crest; Purines; Regeneration; Stem Cells; Zebrafish

T cell immunodeficiency is detrimental, especially when T cell perturbation occurs during severe infection, irradiation, chemotherapy, and age-related thymic atrophy. Therefore, strategies that enhance T cell reconstitution provide considerable benefit and warrant intensive investigation. Here, we report the construction of a T cell ablation model in Tg(coro1a:DenNTR) zebrafish via metronidazole administration. The nascent T cells are mainly derived from the hematopoietic cells migrated from the kidney, the functional homolog of bone marrow and the complete recovery time is 6.5 days post-treatment. The cxcr4b gene is upregulated in the responsive hematopoietic cells. Functional interference of CXCR4 via both genetic and chemical manipulations does not greatly affect T lymphopoiesis, but delays T cell regeneration by disrupting hematopoietic migration. In contrast, cxcr4b accelerates the replenishment of hematopoietic cells in the thymus. Consistently, Cxcl12b, a ligand of Cxcr4, is increased in the thymic epithelial cells of the injured animals. Decreased or increased expression of Cxcl12b results in compromised or accelerated T cell recovery, respectively, similar to those observed with Cxcr4b. Taken together, our study reveals a role of CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling in promoting T cell recovery and provides a promising target for the treatment of immunodeficiency due to T cell injury.	2022-12	2024-03-06 20:17:45	2024-03-06T20:17:45Z		1138-1150		12	49		J Genet Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35483564					Animals; Cell Movement; Cxcl12b; Cxcr4b; Immigration; Signal Transduction; T cell reconstitution; T-Lymphocytes; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, studies addressing the effects of exposure to environmental toxicants during preconception on epigenetic changes in gametes are limited. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of preconceptional exposure to a dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl [PCB126]) on DNA methylation and gene expression in testis. Adult zebrafish were exposed to 3 and 10 nM PCB126 for 24 h and testis tissue was sampled at 7 days postexposure for histology, DNA methylation, and gene expression profiling. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed 37 and 92 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in response to 3 and 10 nM PCB126 exposures, respectively. Among them, 19 DMRs were found to be common between both PCB126 treatment groups. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of DMRs revealed that enrichment of terms such as RNA processing, iron-sulfur cluster assembly, and gluconeogenesis. Gene expression profiling showed differential expression of 40 and 1621 genes in response to 3 and 10 nM PCB126 exposures, respectively. GO analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment of terms related to xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress, and immune function. There is no overlap in the GO terms or individual genes between DNA methylation and RNA sequencing results, but functionally many of the altered pathways have been shown to cause spermatogenic defects.	2022-06-28	2024-03-06 20:17:44	2024-03-06T20:17:44Z		75-87		1	188		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35477799 PMCID: PMC9237993					Animals; DNA; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Testis; Zebrafish; dioxin-like PCBs; environmental epigenetics; testis; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
HABYRXJZ	journalArticle	2022	Zhang, Miao-Qing; Zhang, Jing-Pu; Hu, Chang-Qin	A Rapid Assessment Model for Liver Toxicity of Macrolides and an Integrative Evaluation for Azithromycin Impurities	Frontiers in Pharmacology		1663-9812	10.3389/fphar.2022.860702		Impurities in pharmaceuticals of potentially hazardous materials may cause drug safety problems. Macrolide antibiotic preparations include active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and different types of impurities with similar structures, and the amount of these impurities is usually very low and difficult to be separated for toxicity evaluation. Our previous study indicated that hepatotoxicity induced by macrolides was correlated with c-fos overexpression. Here, we report an assessment of macrolide-related liver toxicity by ADMET prediction, molecular docking, structure-toxicity relationship, and experimental verification via detection of the c-fos gene expression in liver cells. The results showed that a rapid assessment model for the prediction of hepatotoxicity of macrolide antibiotics could be established by calculation of the -CDOCKER interaction energy score with the FosB/JunD bZIP domain and then confirmed by the detection of the c-fos gene expression in L02 cells. Telithromycin, a positive compound of liver toxicity, was used to verify the correctness of the model through comparative analysis of liver toxicity in zebrafish and cytotoxicity in L02 cells exposed to telithromycin and azithromycin. The prediction interval (48.1∼53.1) for quantitative hepatotoxicity in the model was calculated from the docking scores of seven macrolide antibiotics commonly used in clinics. We performed the prediction interval to virtual screening of azithromycin impurities with high hepatotoxicity and then experimentally confirmed by liver toxicity in zebrafish and c-fos gene expression. Simultaneously, we found the hepatotoxicity of azithromycin impurities may be related to the charge of nitrogen (N) atoms on the side chain group at the C5 position via structure-toxicity relationship of azithromycin impurities with different structures. This study provides a theoretical basis for improvement of the quality of macrolide antibiotics.	2022	2024-03-06 20:17:44	2024-03-06T20:17:44Z		860702			13		Front Pharmacol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35444552 PMCID: PMC9014295					ADMET; c-fos; docking energy score; impurity; liver toxicity; macrolides; prediction interval; structure–hepatotoxicity relationship

Transcriptomic and Long-Term Behavioral Deficits Associated with Developmental 3.5 GHz Radiofrequency Radiation Exposures in Zebrafish	Environmental Science & Technology Letters		2328-8930	10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00037		The rapid deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) spectrum by the telecommunication industry is intended to promote better connectivity and data integration among various industries. However, concerns among the public about the safety and health effects of radiofrequency radiations (RFRs) emitted from the newer-generation cell phone frequencies remain, partly due to the lack of robust scientific data. Previously, we used developmental zebrafish to model the bioactivity of 3.5 GHz RFR, a frequency used by 5G-enabled cell phones, in a novel RFR exposure chamber. With RFR exposures from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 48 hpf, we observed that, despite no teratogenic effects, embryos showed subtle hypoactivity in a startle response behavior assay, suggesting abnormal sensorimotor behavior. This study builds upon the previous one by investigating the transcriptomic basis of RFR-associated behavior effects and their persistence into adulthood. Using mRNA sequencing, we found a modest transcriptomic disruption at 48 hpf, with 28 differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that biochemical pathways related to metabolism were significantly perturbed. Embryos were grown to adulthood, and then a battery of behavioral assays suggested subtle but significant abnormal responses in RFR-exposed fish across the different assays evaluated that suggest potential long-term behavioral effects. Overall, our study suggests the impacts of RFRs on the developing brain, behavior, and the metabolome should be further explored.	2022-04-12	2024-03-06 20:17:44	2024-03-06T20:17:44Z		327-332		4	9		Environ Sci Technol Lett								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35434172 PMCID: PMC9009179

Cross-species transcriptomic signatures identify mechanisms related to species sensitivity and common responses to nanomaterials	Nature Nanotechnology		1748-3395	10.1038/s41565-022-01096-2		Physico-chemical characteristics of engineered nanomaterials are known to be important in determining the impact on organisms but effects are equally dependent upon the characteristics of the organism exposed. Species sensitivity may vary by orders of magnitude, which could be due to differences in the type or magnitude of the biochemical response, exposure or uptake of nanomaterials. Synthesizing conclusions across studies and species is difficult as multiple species are not often included in a study, and differences in batches of nanomaterials, the exposure duration and media across experiments confound comparisons. Here three model species, Danio rerio, Daphnia magna and Chironomus riparius, that differ in sensitivity to lithium cobalt oxide nanosheets are found to differ in immune-response, iron-sulfur protein and central nervous system pathways, among others. Nanomaterial uptake and dissolution does not fully explain cross-species differences. This comparison provides insight into how biomolecular responses across species relate to the varying sensitivity to nanomaterials.	2022-06	2024-03-06 20:17:44	2024-03-06T20:17:44Z		661-669		6	17		Nat Nanotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35393598					Animals; Daphnia; Nanostructures; Transcriptome; Water Pollutants, Chemical

The Ahr2-Dependent wfikkn1 Gene Influences Zebrafish Transcriptome, Proteome, and Behavior	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfac037		The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is required for vertebrate development and is also activated by exogenous chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). AHR activation is well-understood, but roles of downstream molecular signaling events are largely unknown. From previous transcriptomics in 48 h postfertilization (hpf) zebrafish exposed to several PAHs and TCDD, we found wfikkn1 was highly coexpressed with cyp1a (marker for AHR activation). Thus, we hypothesized wfikkn1's role in AHR signaling, and showed that wfikkn1 expression was Ahr2 (zebrafish ortholog of human AHR)-dependent in developing zebrafish exposed to TCDD. To functionally characterize wfikkn1, we made a CRISPR-Cas9 mutant line with a 16-bp deletion in wfikkn1's exon, and exposed wildtype and mutants to dimethyl sulfoxide or TCDD. 48-hpf mRNA sequencing revealed over 700 genes that were differentially expressed (p < .05, log2FC > 1) between each pair of treatment combinations, suggesting an important role for wfikkn1 in altering both the 48-hpf transcriptome and TCDD-induced expression changes. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics of 48-hpf wildtype and mutants revealed 325 significant differentially expressed proteins. Functional enrichment demonstrated wfikkn1 was involved in skeletal muscle development and played a role in neurological pathways after TCDD exposure. Mutant zebrafish appeared morphologically normal but had significant behavior deficiencies at all life stages, and absence of Wfikkn1 did not significantly alter TCDD-induced behavior effects at all life stages. In conclusion, wfikkn1 did not appear to be significantly involved in TCDD's overt toxicity but is likely a necessary functional member of the AHR signaling cascade.	2022-05-26	2024-03-06 20:17:44	2024-03-06T20:17:44Z		325-344		2	187		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35377459 PMCID: PMC9308396					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Proteome; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; TCDD; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR); behavior; transcriptomics; wfikkn1; zebrafish

It has been debated whether HECs and non-HSC-forming conventional endothelial cells (cECs) arise from a common precursor or represent distinct lineages. Moreover, the molecular basis underlying their distinct fate determination is poorly understood. We use photoconvertible labeling, time-lapse imaging, and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to trace the lineage of HECs. We discovered that HECs and cECs arise from a common hemogenic angioblast precursor, and their distinct fate is determined by high or low dosage of Etv2, respectively. Our results illuminate the lineage origin and a mechanism on the fate determination of HECs, which may enhance the understanding on the ontogeny of HECs in vertebrates.	2022-03-29	2024-03-06 20:17:43	2024-03-06T20:17:43Z		e2119051119		13	119		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35333649 PMCID: PMC9060440					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Endothelium, Vascular; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; endothelium; fate determination; hemogenic endothelium; lineage origin

Anatomic position determines oncogenic specificity in melanoma	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/s41586-022-04584-6		Oncogenic alterations to DNA are not transforming in all cellular contexts1,2. This may be due to pre-existing transcriptional programmes in the cell of origin. Here we define anatomic position as a major determinant of why cells respond to specific oncogenes. Cutaneous melanoma arises throughout the body, whereas the acral subtype arises on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or under the nails3. We sequenced the DNA of cutaneous and acral melanomas from a large cohort of human patients and found a specific enrichment for BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma and enrichment for CRKL amplifications in acral melanoma. We modelled these changes in transgenic zebrafish models and found that CRKL-driven tumours formed predominantly in the fins of the fish. The fins are the evolutionary precursors to tetrapod limbs, indicating that melanocytes in these acral locations may be uniquely susceptible to CRKL. RNA profiling of these fin and limb melanocytes, when compared with body melanocytes, revealed a positional identity gene programme typified by posterior HOX13 genes. This positional gene programme synergized with CRKL to amplify insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling and drive tumours at acral sites. Abrogation of this CRKL-driven programme eliminated the anatomic specificity of acral melanoma. These data suggest that the anatomic position of the cell of origin endows it with a unique transcriptional state that makes it susceptible to only certain oncogenic insults.	2022-04	2024-03-06 20:17:43	2024-03-06T20:17:43Z		354-361		7905	604		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35355015 PMCID: PMC9355078					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carcinogenesis; Foot; Hand; Humans; Melanoma; Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant; Nails; Oncogenes; Skin Neoplasms; Transcription, Genetic; Zebrafish

Beneficial impacts of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle structure and function in the zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.62760		Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) allows activation of muscle fibers in the absence of voluntary force generation. NMES could have the potential to promote muscle homeostasis in the context of muscle disease, but the impacts of NMES on diseased muscle are not well understood. We used the zebrafish Duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) mutant and a longitudinal design to elucidate the consequences of NMES on muscle health. We designed four neuromuscular stimulation paradigms loosely based on weightlifting regimens. Each paradigm differentially affected neuromuscular structure, function, and survival. Only endurance neuromuscular stimulation (eNMES) improved all outcome measures. We found that eNMES improves muscle and neuromuscular junction morphology, swimming, and survival. Heme oxygenase and integrin alpha7 are required for eNMES-mediated improvement. Our data indicate that neuromuscular stimulation can be beneficial, suggesting that the right type of activity may benefit patients with muscle disease.	2022-03-24	2024-03-06 20:17:42	2024-03-06T20:17:42Z		e62760			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35324428 PMCID: PMC8947762					Animals; Electric Stimulation; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Neuromuscular Junction; Zebrafish; developmental biology; dystroglycanopathies; neuromuscular development; skeletal muscle; zebrafish

Hnrnpul1 controls transcription, splicing, and modulates skeletal and limb development in vivo	G3 (Bethesda, Md.)		2160-1836	10.1093/g3journal/jkac067		Mutations in RNA-binding proteins can lead to pleiotropic phenotypes including craniofacial, skeletal, limb, and neurological symptoms.

We show a developmental role for Hnrnpul1 in zebrafish, resulting in reduced body and fin growth and missing bones. Defects in craniofacial tendon growth and adult-onset caudal scoliosis are also seen. We demonstrate a role for Hnrnpul1 in alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation using RNA-sequencing, particularly of genes involved in translation, ubiquitination, and DNA damage. Given its cross-species conservation and role in splicing, it would not be surprising if it had a role in human development. Whole-exome sequencing detected a homozygous frameshift variant in HNRNPUL1 in 2 siblings with congenital limb malformations, which is a candidate gene for their limb malformations. Zebrafish Hnrnpul1 mutants suggest an important developmental role of hnRNPUL1 and provide motivation for exploring the potential conservation of ancient regulatory circuits involving hnRNPUL1 in human development.	2022-05-06	2024-03-06 20:17:42	2024-03-06T20:17:42Z		jkac067		5	12		G3 (Bethesda)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35325113 PMCID: PMC9073674					Alternative Splicing; Animals; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Hnrnpul1; RNA; RNA Splicing; Zebrafish; alternative splicing; craniofacial; limb; scoliosis; zebrafish

Starvation causes changes in the intestinal transcriptome and microbiome that are reversed upon refeeding	BMC genomics		1471-2164	10.1186/s12864-022-08447-2		BACKGROUND: The ability of animals and their microbiomes to adapt to starvation and then restore homeostasis after refeeding is fundamental to their continued survival and symbiosis. The intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption and microbiome interaction, however our understanding of intestinal adaptations to starvation and refeeding remains limited. Here we used RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to uncover changes in the intestinal transcriptome and microbiome of zebrafish subjected to long-term starvation and refeeding compared to continuously fed controls. RESULTS: Starvation over 21 days led to increased diversity and altered composition in the intestinal microbiome compared to fed controls, including relative increases in Vibrio and reductions in Plesiomonas bacteria. Starvation also led to significant alterations in host gene expression in the intestine, with distinct pathways affected at early and late stages of starvation. This included increases in the expression of ribosome biogenesis genes early in starvation, followed by decreased expression of genes involved in antiviral immunity and lipid transport at later stages. These effects of starvation on the host transcriptome and microbiome were almost completely restored within 3 days after refeeding. Comparison with published datasets identified host genes responsive to starvation as well as high-fat feeding or microbiome colonization, and predicted host transcription factors that may be involved in starvation response. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term starvation induces progressive changes in microbiome composition and host gene expression in the zebrafish intestine, and these changes are rapidly reversed after refeeding. Our identification of bacterial taxa, host genes and host pathways involved in this response provides a framework for future investigation of the physiological and ecological mechanisms underlying intestinal adaptations to food restriction.	2022-03-22	2024-03-06 20:17:42	2024-03-06T20:17:42Z		225		1	23		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35317738 PMCID: PMC8941736					Animals; Intestines; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptional dynamics of HC regeneration in zebrafish at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We uncovered three sequentially activated modules: first, an injury/inflammatory response and downregulation of progenitor cell maintenance genes within minutes after HC loss; second, the transient activation of regeneration-specific genes; and third, a robust re-activation of developmental gene programs, including HC specification, cell-cycle activation, ribosome biogenesis, and a metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation. The results are relevant not only for our understanding of HC regeneration and how we might be able to trigger it in mammals but also for regenerative processes in general. The data are searchable and publicly accessible via a web-based interface.	2022-03-28	2024-03-06 20:17:42	2024-03-06T20:17:42Z		799-819.e6		6	57		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35316618 PMCID: PMC9188816					Animals; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Hair; Mammals; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; hair cell death; hair cell regeneration; lateral line system; mechanosensory organ; neomycin; pseudotime analysis; scRNA-seq atlas; stem cells; support cells; zebrafish

Shear stress switches the association of endothelial enhancers from ETV/ETS to KLF transcription factor binding sites	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-022-08645-8		Endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessels are exposed to mechanical forces, such as shear stress. These forces control many aspects of EC biology, including vascular tone, cell migration and proliferation. Despite a good understanding of the genes responding to shear stress, our insight into the transcriptional regulation of these genes is much more limited. Here, we set out to study alterations in the chromatin landscape of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to laminar shear stress. To do so, we performed ChIP-Seq for H3K27 acetylation, indicative of active enhancer elements and ATAC-Seq to mark regions of open chromatin in addition to RNA-Seq on HUVEC exposed to 6 h of laminar shear stress. Our results show a correlation of gained and lost enhancers with up and downregulated genes, respectively. DNA motif analysis revealed an over-representation of KLF transcription factor (TF) binding sites in gained enhancers, while lost enhancers contained more ETV/ETS motifs. We validated a subset of flow responsive enhancers using luciferase-based reporter constructs and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. Lastly, we characterized the shear stress response in ECs of zebrafish embryos using RNA-Seq. Our results lay the groundwork for the exploration of shear stress responsive elements in controlling EC biology.	2022-03-21	2024-03-06 20:17:41	2024-03-06T20:17:41Z		4795		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35314737 PMCID: PMC8938417					Animals; Binding Sites; Cells, Cultured; Chromatin; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Stress, Mechanical; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

The adult zebrafish has been an underutilized tool to study liver fibrosis. We aimed to characterize the single-cell transcriptome of the adult zebrafish liver to determine its utility as a model for studying liver fibrosis. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of adult zebrafish liver to study the molecular and cellular dynamics at a single-cell level. We performed a comparative analysis to scRNA-seq of human liver with a focus on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the driver cells in liver fibrosis. scRNA-seq reveals transcriptionally unique populations of hepatic cell types that comprise the zebrafish liver. Joint clustering with human liver scRNA-seq data demonstrates high conservation of transcriptional profiles and human marker genes in zebrafish. Human and zebrafish HSCs show conservation of transcriptional profiles, and we uncover collectin subfamily member 11 (colec11) as a novel, conserved marker for zebrafish HSCs. To demonstrate the power of scRNA-seq to study liver fibrosis using zebrafish, we performed scRNA-seq on our zebrafish model of a pediatric liver disease with mutation in mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) and characteristic early liver fibrosis. We found fibrosis signaling pathways and upstream regulators conserved across MPI-depleted zebrafish and human HSCs. CellPhoneDB analysis of zebrafish transcriptome identified neuropilin 1 as a potential driver of liver fibrosis. Conclusion: This study establishes the first scRNA-seq atlas of the adult zebrafish liver, highlights the high degree of similarity to human liver, and strengthens its value as a model to study liver fibrosis.	2022-07	2024-03-06 20:17:41	2024-03-06T20:17:41Z		1711-1724		7	6		Hepatol Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35315595 PMCID: PMC9234649					Animals; Child; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Mannose-6-Phosphate Isomerase; Phenotype; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

In the zebrafish, Wilms tumor 1 transcription factor a (wt1a) and b (wt1b) genes are expressed in the pericardium, at the venous pole of the heart. From this pericardial layer, the proepicardium emerges. Proepicardial cells are subsequently transferred to the myocardial surface and form the epicardium, covering the myocardium. We found that while wt1a and wt1b expression is maintained in proepicardial cells, it is downregulated in pericardial cells that contributes cardiomyocytes to the developing heart. Sustained wt1b expression in cardiomyocytes reduced chromatin accessibility of specific genomic loci. Strikingly, a subset of wt1a- and wt1b-expressing cardiomyocytes changed their cell-adhesion properties, delaminated from the myocardium and upregulated epicardial gene expression. Thus, wt1a and wt1b act as a break for cardiomyocyte differentiation, and ectopic wt1a and wt1b expression in cardiomyocytes can lead to their transdifferentiation into epicardial-like cells.	2022-03-15	2024-03-06 20:17:41	2024-03-06T20:17:41Z		dev200375		6	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35312773 PMCID: PMC8977101					Animals; Cardiomyocyte; Cell fate; Epicardium; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart development; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pericardium; Transcription Factors; WT1 Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; wt1a; wt1b

Identification of an evolutionarily conserved domain in Neurod1 favouring enteroendocrine versus goblet cell fate	PLoS genetics		1553-7404	10.1371/journal.pgen.1010109		ARP/ASCL transcription factors are key determinants of cell fate specification in a wide variety of tissues, coordinating the acquisition of generic cell fates and of specific subtype identities. How these factors, recognizing highly similar DNA motifs, display specific activities, is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, we overexpressed different ARP/ASCL factors in zebrafish ascl1a-/- mutant embryos to determine which ones are able to rescue the intestinal secretory lineage. We found that Ascl1a/b, Atoh1a/b and Neurod1 factors are all able to trigger the first step of the secretory regulatory cascade but distinct secretory cells are induced by these factors. Indeed, Neurod1 rescues the enteroendocrine lineage while Ascl1a/b and Atoh1a/b rescue the goblet cells. Gain-of-function experiments with Ascl1a/Neurod1 chimeric proteins revealed that the functional divergence is encoded by a 19-aa ultra-conserved element (UCE), present in all Neurod members but absent in the other ARP/ASCL proteins. Importantly, inserting the UCE into the Ascl1a protein reverses the rescuing capacity of this Ascl1a chimeric protein that cannot rescue the goblet cells anymore but can efficiently rescue the enteroendocrine cells. This novel domain acts indeed as a goblet cell fate repressor that inhibits gfi1aa expression, known to be important for goblet cell differentiation. Deleting the UCE domain of the endogenous Neurod1 protein leads to an increase in the number of goblet cells concomitant with a reduction of the enteroendocrine cells, phenotype also observed in the neurod1 null mutant. This highlights the crucial function of the UCE domain for NeuroD1 activity in the intestine. As Gfi1 acts as a binary cell fate switch in several tissues where Neurod1 is also expressed, we can envision a similar role of the UCE in other tissues, allowing Neurod1 to repress Gfi1 to influence the balance between cell fates.	2022-03	2024-03-06 20:17:41	2024-03-06T20:17:41Z		e1010109		3	18		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35286299 PMCID: PMC8959185					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Goblet Cells; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

In contrast to mammals, zebrafish possess the ability to intrinsically regenerate a functional RPE layer after severe injury. The molecular underpinnings of this regenerative process remain largely unknown yet hold tremendous potential for developing treatment strategies to stimulate endogenous regeneration in the human eye. In this study, we demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is activated in RPE cells post-genetic ablation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTOR activity impaired RPE regeneration, while mTOR activation enhanced RPE recovery post-injury, demonstrating that mTOR activity is essential for RPE regeneration in zebrafish. RNA-seq of RPE isolated from mTOR-inhibited larvae identified a number of genes and pathways dependent on mTOR activity at early and late stages of regeneration; amongst these were components of the immune system, which is emerging as a key regulator of regenerative responses across various tissue and model systems. Our results identify crosstalk between macrophages/microglia and the RPE, wherein mTOR activity is required for recruitment of macrophages/microglia to the RPE injury site. Macrophages/microglia then reinforce mTOR activity in regenerating RPE cells. Interestingly, the function of macrophages/microglia in maintaining mTOR activity in the RPE appeared to be inflammation-independent. Taken together, these data identify mTOR activity as a key regulator of RPE regeneration and link the mTOR pathway to immune responses in facilitating RPE regeneration.	2022-03	2024-03-06 20:17:40	2024-03-06T20:17:40Z		e1009628		3	18		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35271573 PMCID: PMC8939802					Animals; Macular Degeneration; Mammals; Regeneration; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zebrafish

A Vegfc-Emilin2a-Cxcl8a Signaling Axis Required for Zebrafish Cardiac Regeneration	Circulation Research		1524-4571	10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319929		BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease following the obstruction of coronary vessels leads to the death of cardiac tissue and the formation of a fibrotic scar. In contrast to adult mammals, zebrafish can regenerate their heart after injury, enabling the study of the underlying mechanisms. One of the earliest responses following cardiac injury in adult zebrafish is coronary revascularization. Defects in this process lead to impaired cardiomyocyte repopulation and scarring. Hence, identifying and investigating factors that promote coronary revascularization holds great therapeutic potential. METHODS: We used wholemount imaging, immunohistochemistry and histology to assess various aspects of zebrafish cardiac regeneration. Deep transcriptomic analysis allowed us to identify targets and potential effectors of Vegfc (vascular endothelial growth factor C) signaling. We used newly generated loss- and gain-of-function genetic tools to investigate the role of Emilin2a (elastin microfibril interfacer 2a) and Cxcl8a (chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand 8a)-Cxcr1 (chemokine (C-X-C) motif receptor 1) signaling in cardiac regeneration. RESULTS: We first show that regenerating coronary endothelial cells upregulate vegfc upon cardiac injury in adult zebrafish and that Vegfc signaling is required for their proliferation during regeneration. Notably, blocking Vegfc signaling also significantly reduces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation. Using transcriptomic analyses, we identified emilin2a as a target of Vegfc signaling and found that manipulation of emilin2a expression can modulate coronary revascularization as well as cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Emilin2a induces the expression of the chemokine gene cxcl8a in epicardium-derived cells, while cxcr1, the Cxcl8a receptor gene, is expressed in coronary endothelial cells. We further show that Cxcl8a-Cxcr1 signaling is also required for coronary endothelial cell proliferation during cardiac regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that after cardiac injury, coronary endothelial cells upregulate vegfc to promote coronary network reestablishment and cardiac regeneration. Mechanistically, Vegfc signaling upregulates epicardial emilin2a and cxcl8a expression to promote cardiac regeneration. These studies aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying coronary revascularization in zebrafish, with potential therapeutic implications to enhance revascularization and regeneration in injured human hearts.	2022-04	2024-03-06 20:17:40	2024-03-06T20:17:40Z		1014-1029		7	130		Circ Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35264012 PMCID: PMC8976759					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Endothelial Cells; Heart; Interleukin-8; Membrane Glycoproteins; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; coronary vessels; endothelial cells; myocardial infarction; regeneration; zebrafish

To address this issue, we perturbed four signaling pathways critical for body plan formation in the cephalochordate amphioxus and in zebrafish and compared the effects of such perturbations on gene expression and gene regulation in both species. Our data reveal that many developmental genes have gained response to these signaling pathways in the vertebrate lineage. Moreover, we show that the interconnectivity between these pathways is much higher in zebrafish than in amphioxus. We conclude that this increased signaling pathway complexity likely contributed to vertebrate morphological novelties during evolution.	2022-03-15	2024-03-06 20:16:10	2024-03-06T20:16:10Z		e2114802119		11	119		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35263228 PMCID: PMC8931241					Animals; Biological Evolution; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Lancelets; Zebrafish; amphioxus; evolution; regulatory network; signaling pathway; zebrafish

Mutations in NRL are associated with the autosomal recessive enhanced S-cone syndrome and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. However, the exact role of Nrl in regulating the development and maintenance of photoreceptors in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular animal model used for retinal degeneration and regeneration studies, has not been fully determined. In this study, we generated an nrl knockout zebrafish model via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and observed a surprising phenotype characterized by a reduced number, but not the total loss, of rods and over-growth of green cones. We discovered two waves of rod genesis, nrl-dependent and -independent at the embryonic and post-embryonic stages, respectively, in zebrafish by monitoring the rod development. Through bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the gene expression profiles of the whole retina and each retinal cell type from the wild type and nrl knockout zebrafish. The over-growth of green cones and mis-expression of green-cone-specific genes in rods in nrl mutants suggested that there are rod/green-cone bipotent precursors, whose fate choice between rod versus green-cone is controlled by nrl. Besides, we identified the mafba gene as a novel regulator of the nrl-independent rod development, based on the cell-type-specific expression patterns and the retinal phenotype of nrl/mafba double-knockout zebrafish. Gene collinearity analysis revealed the evolutionary origin of mafba and suggested that the function of mafba in rod development is specific to modern fishes. Furthermore, the altered photoreceptor composition and abnormal gene expression in nrl mutants caused progressive retinal degeneration and subsequent regeneration. Accordingly, this study revealed a novel function of the mafba gene in rod development and established a working model for the developmental and regulatory mechanisms regarding the rod and green-cone photoreceptors in zebrafish.	2022-03	2024-03-06 20:16:10	2024-03-06T20:16:10Z		e1009841		3	18		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35245286 PMCID: PMC8926279					Animals; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Eye Proteins; Mammals; Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells; Retinal Degeneration; Zebrafish

However, the changes in neutrophil behavior during tumor initiation remain unclear. Here we used Translating Ribosomal Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA sequencing to identify neutrophil, macrophage and transformed epithelial cell transcriptional changes induced by oncogenic RasG12V in larval zebrafish. We found that transformed epithelial cells and neutrophils, but not macrophages, had significant changes in gene expression in larval zebrafish. Interestingly, neutrophils had more significantly down-regulated genes, whereas gene expression was primarily upregulated in transformed epithelial cells. The antioxidant, thioredoxin (txn), a small thiol that regulates reduction-oxidation (redox) balance, was upregulated in transformed keratinocytes and neutrophils in response to oncogenic Ras. To determine the role of thioredoxin during tumor initiation, we generated a zebrafish thioredoxin mutant. We observed an increase in wound-induced reactive oxygen species signaling and neutrophil recruitment in thioredoxin-deficient zebrafish. Transformed keratinocytes also showed increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis in thioredoxin-deficient larvae. Using live imaging, we visualized neutrophil behavior near transformed cells and found increased neutrophil recruitment and altered motility dynamics. Finally, in the absence of neutrophils, transformed keratinocytes no longer exhibited increased proliferation in thioredoxin mutants. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that tumor initiation induces changes in neutrophil gene expression and behavior that can impact proliferation of transformed cells in the early tumor microenvironment.	2022	2024-03-06 20:16:10	2024-03-06T20:16:10Z		818893			13		Front Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35250998 PMCID: PMC8891495					Animals; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Gene Expression Profiling; Larva; Thioredoxins; Tumor Microenvironment; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; gene expression; keratinocyte; migration; neutrophil; thioredoxin (txn); tumor initiation

In melanoma, alterations in histone methyltransferases that catalyze methylation at histone 3 lysine 9 and histone 3 lysine 27-two sites of critical post-translational modification-have been reported. To study the function of these methyltransferases in melanoma, we engineered melanocytes to express histone 3 lysine-to-methionine mutations at lysine 9 and lysine 27, which are known to inhibit the activity of histone methyltransferases, in a zebrafish melanoma model. Using this system, we found that loss of histone 3 lysine 9 methylation dramatically suppressed melanoma formation and that inhibition of histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferases in human melanoma cells increased innate immune response signatures. In contrast, loss of histone 3 lysine 27 methylation significantly accelerated melanoma formation. We identified FOXD1 as a top target of PRC2 that is silenced in melanocytes and found that aberrant overexpression of FOXD1 accelerated melanoma onset. Collectively, these data demonstrate how histone 3 lysine-to-methionine mutations can be used to uncover critical roles for methyltransferases.	2022	2024-03-06 20:16:09	2024-03-06T20:16:09Z		814216			10		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35223844 PMCID: PMC8866878					epigenetics; histone 3; histone methyl transferase (HMT); melanoma; zebrafish

YAP regulates an SGK1/mTORC1/SREBP-dependent lipogenic program to support proliferation and tissue growth	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2022.02.004		The coordinated regulation of growth control and metabolic pathways is required to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) reprograms cellular metabolism to meet the anabolic demands of growth, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that YAP co-opts the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-dependent lipogenic program to facilitate proliferation and tissue growth. Mechanistically, YAP stimulates de novo lipogenesis via mechanistic target of rapamcyin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and subsequent activation of SREBP. Importantly, YAP-dependent regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is required to activate mTORC1/SREBP and stimulate de novo lipogenesis. We also find that the SREBP target genes fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) are conditionally required to support YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth. These studies reveal that de novo lipogenesis is a metabolic vulnerability that can be targeted to disrupt YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth.	2022-03-28	2024-03-06 20:16:09	2024-03-06T20:16:09Z		719-731.e8		6	57		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35216681					Cell Proliferation; Lipogenesis; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; SGK1; SREBP; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins; YAP; cell metabolism; growth; lipogenesis; mTORC1; proliferation

Cardiac injury activates dynamic gene expression programs in epicardial tissue, which in zebrafish enables subsequent regeneration through paracrine and vascularizing effects. To identify tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) that control injury-induced epicardial gene expression during heart regeneration, we profiled transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility in epicardial cells purified from regenerating zebrafish hearts. We identified hundreds of candidate TREEs, which are defined by increased chromatin accessibility of non-coding elements near genes with increased expression during regeneration. Several of these candidate TREEs were incorporated into stable transgenic lines, with five out of six elements directing injury-induced epicardial expression but not ontogenetic epicardial expression in larval hearts. Whereas two independent TREEs linked to the gene gnai3 showed similar functional features of gene regulation in transgenic lines, two independent ncam1a-linked TREEs directed distinct spatiotemporal domains of epicardial gene expression. Thus, multiple TREEs linked to a regeneration gene can possess either matching or complementary regulatory controls. Our study provides a new resource and principles for understanding the regulation of epicardial genetic programs during heart regeneration.

However, the clinical utility of mouse patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models remains limited given current technical constraints, including difficulty in generating sufficient sample numbers from small tissue samples and a long latency period for results. To overcome these issues, we established zebrafish GBM xenografts of diverse origin, which can tolerate intracranial engraftment and maintain their unique histological features. Subsequent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis confirmed significant transcriptional identity to that of invading GBM microtumors observed in the proportionally larger brains of model animals and humans. Endothelial scRNA-seq confirmed that the zebrafish blood-brain barrier is homologous to the mammalian blood-brain barrier. Finally, we established a rapid and efficient zebrafish PDOX (zPDOX) model, which can predict long-term outcomes of GBM patients within 20 days. The zPDOX model provides a novel avenue for precision medicine of GBM, especially for the evaluation of intracranial infiltration tendency and prediction of individual drug sensitivity.	2022-04-01	2024-03-06 20:16:08	2024-03-06T20:16:08Z		dmm049109		4	15		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35199829 PMCID: PMC9066514					Animals; Blood–brain barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Glioblastoma; Heterogeneity; Heterografts; Humans; Mammals; Mice; PDOX; PDX; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish

Previous studies have shown a link between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and alcohol addiction. However, the role of α6β2* nAChR in alcohol addiction remains obscure, and whether α6β2* nAChR can be used as a potential drug target for alcohol withdrawal need to be studied. Methods: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0.2% alcohol for 14 days followed by 7 days of repeated withdrawal and then retro-orbitally injected with α-conotoxin TxIB (a selective α6β2* nAChR antagonist). Open Field Test was applied to characterize zebrafish behavior parameters. The monoamine neurotransmitter amounts and their mRNA expression in the zebrafish brain were identified using ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and subsequent bioinformatics analysis were employed to explore the potential network regulation of TxIB after alcohol withdrawal. Results: The max speed in the center area of the Open Field Test was significantly higher in the withdrawal group whereas TxIB injection corrected this abnormality. The amount and mRNA expression of monoamine neurotransmitters did not change significantly after alcohol withdrawal and TxIB administration. RNA sequencing of zebrafish brain indicated a total of 657 genes showed aberrant expression and among which 225 were reversed after TxIB injection. These reversed genes were significantly enriched in the calcium ion binding pathway and the gene expression profile was further validated by RT-PCR. Conclusion: Our finding suggests α-conotoxin TxIB improved behavioral abnormality induced by alcohol-withdrawal, and changed gene expression mainly in the calcium signaling pathway. Therefore, α-conotoxin TxIB is expected to become a potential therapeutic agent for alcohol withdrawal.	2022	2024-03-06 20:16:07	2024-03-06T20:16:07Z		802917			13		Front Pharmacol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35177988 PMCID: PMC8844014					ELISA; RT-PCR; alcohol withdrawal; monoamine neurotransmitters; transcriptome analysis; zebrafish; α-conotoxin TxIB; α6β2∗ nAChR

Cardiovascular dysfunction has an increasing prevalence with age and is one of the leading causes of death. In contrast to humans, zebrafish have extraordinary regeneration capacities of complex organs including the heart. In addition, zebrafish has recently become a model organism in research on aging. Here, we have compared the ventricular transcriptome as well as the regenerative capacity after cryoinjury of old and young zebrafish hearts. We identified the immune system as activated in old ventricles and found muscle organization to deteriorate upon aging. Our data show an accumulation of immune cells, mostly macrophages, in the old zebrafish ventricle. Those immune cells not only increased in numbers but also showed morphological and behavioral changes with age. Our data further suggest that the regenerative response to cardiac injury is generally impaired and much more variable in old fish. Collagen in the wound area was already significantly enriched in old fish at 7 days post injury. Taken together, these data indicate an 'inflammaging'-like process in the zebrafish heart and suggest a change in regenerative response in the old.	2022-01-20	2024-03-06 20:16:07	2024-03-06T20:16:07Z		345		3	11		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35159152 PMCID: PMC8834511					Aging; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Heart; Macrophages; Zebrafish; age-dependent regeneration; aging; cryoinjury; immune cells; zebrafish heart

Trap-TRAP, a Versatile Tool for Tissue-Specific Translatomics in Zebrafish	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2021.817191		Developmental and physiological processes depend on the transcriptional and translational activity of heterogeneous cell populations. A main challenge in gene expression studies is dealing with this intrinsic complexity while keeping sequencing efficiency. Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methods have allowed cell-specific recovery of polyribosome-associated RNAs by genetic tagging of ribosomes in selected cell populations. Here we combined the TRAP approach with adapted enhancer trap methods (trap-TRAP) to systematically generate zebrafish transgenic lines suitable for tissue-specific translatome interrogation. Through the random integration of a GFP-tagged version of the large subunit ribosomal protein L10a (EGFP-Rpl10a), we have generated stable lines driving expression in a variety of tissues, including the retina, skeletal muscle, lateral line primordia, rhombomeres, or jaws. To increase the range of applications, a UAS:TRAP transgenic line compatible with available Gal4 lines was also generated and tested. The resulting collection of lines and applications constitutes a resource for the zebrafish community in developmental genetics, organ physiology and disease modelling.	2021	2024-03-06 20:16:07	2024-03-06T20:16:07Z		817191			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35174174 PMCID: PMC8841413					Gal4/UAS; TRAP; enhancer-trap; translatome; zebrafish

Single-cell resolution of MET- and EMT-like programs in osteoblasts during zebrafish fin regeneration	iScience		2589-0042	10.1016/j.isci.2022.103784		Zebrafish regenerate fin rays following amputation through epimorphic regeneration, a process that has been proposed to involve the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to elucidate osteoblastic transcriptional programs during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration. We show that osteoprogenitors are enriched with components associated with EMT and its reverse, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), and provide evidence that the EMT markers cdh11 and twist2 are co-expressed in dedifferentiating cells at the amputation stump at 1 dpa, and in differentiating osteoblastic cells in the regenerate, the latter of which are enriched in EMT signatures. We also show that esrp1, a regulator of alternative splicing in epithelial cells that is associated with MET, is expressed in a subset of osteoprogenitors during outgrowth. This study provides a single cell resource for the study of osteoblastic cells during zebrafish fin regeneration, and supports the contribution of MET- and EMT-associated components to this process.	2022-02-18	2024-03-06 20:16:07	2024-03-06T20:16:07Z		103784		2	25		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35169687 PMCID: PMC8829776					Biological sciences; Developmental biology; Omics; Transcriptomics

Sulfonamide functional head on short-chain perfluorinated substance drives developmental toxicity	iScience		2589-0042	10.1016/j.isci.2022.103789		Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitously detected in environmental and biological samples and cause adverse health effects. Studies have predominately focused on long-chain PFAS, with far fewer addressing short-chain alternatives. This study leveraged embryonic zebrafish to investigate developmental toxicity of a short-chain series: perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA), and 4:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (4:2 FTS). Following static exposures at 8 h postfertilization (hpf) to each chemical (1-100 μM), morphological and behavioral endpoints were assessed at 24 and 120 hpf. Only FBSA induced abnormal morphology, while exposure to all chemicals caused aberrant larval behavior. RNA sequencing at 48 hpf following 47 μM exposures revealed only FBSA significantly disrupted normal gene expression. Measured tissue concentrations were FBSA > PFBS > 4:2 FTS > PFPeA. This study demonstrates functional head groups impact bioactivity and bioconcentration.	2022-02-18	2024-03-06 20:16:07	2024-03-06T20:16:07Z		103789		2	25		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35146398 PMCID: PMC8819378					Chemistry; Developmental biology; Surface chemistry; Toxicology

The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze chromatin accessibility and time-resolved transcription in single and double mutant zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox19b. We show that two factors modify chromatin in a largely independent manner. We distinguish four types of direct enhancers by differential requirements for Pou5f3 or Sox19b. We demonstrate that changes in chromatin accessibility of enhancers underlie the changes in zygotic expression repertoire in the double mutants. Pou5f3 or Sox19b promote chromatin accessibility of enhancers linked to the genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently of Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, simultaneous loss of Pou5f3 and Sox19b leads to premature expression of genes, involved in regulation of organogenesis and differentiation.	2022-02-10	2024-03-06 20:16:06	2024-03-06T20:16:06Z		788		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35145080 PMCID: PMC8831532					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Chromatin; Female; Gastrulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genome; Male; Octamer Transcription Factor-3; SOX Transcription Factors; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

Alx1, a homeobox transcription factor, is a key regulator of midfacial morphogenesis. ALX1 mutations in humans are linked to severe congenital anomalies of the facial skeleton (frontonasal dysplasia, FND) with malformation or absence of eyes and orbital contents (micro- and anophthalmia). Zebrafish with loss-of-function alx1 mutations develop with craniofacial and ocular defects of variable penetrance, likely due to compensatory upregulation in expression of a paralogous gene, alx3. Here we show that zebrafish alx1;alx3 mutants develop with highly penetrant cranial and ocular defects that resemble human ALX1-linked FND. alx1 and alx3 are expressed in anterior cranial neural crest (aCNC), which gives rise to the anterior neurocranium (ANC), anterior segment structures of the eye and vascular pericytes. Consistent with a functional requirement for alx genes in aCNC, alx1; alx3 mutants develop with nearly absent ANC and grossly aberrant hyaloid vasculature and ocular anterior segment, but normal retina. In vivo lineage labeling identified a requirement for alx1 and alx3 during aCNC migration, and transcriptomic analysis suggested oxidative stress response as a key target mechanism of this function. Oxidative stress is a hallmark of fetal alcohol toxicity, and we found increased penetrance of facial and ocular malformations in alx1 mutants exposed to ethanol, consistent with a protective role for alx1 against ethanol toxicity. Collectively, these data demonstrate a conserved role for zebrafish alx genes in controlling ocular and facial development, and a novel role in protecting these key midfacial structures from ethanol toxicity during embryogenesis. These data also reveal novel roles for alx genes in ocular anterior segment formation and vascular development and suggest that retinal deficits in alx mutants may be secondary to aberrant ocular vascularization and anterior segment defects. This study establishes robust zebrafish models for interrogating conserved genetic mechanisms that coordinate facial and ocular development, and for exploring gene--environment interactions relevant to fetal alcohol syndrome.	2022-05-15	2024-03-06 20:16:06	2024-03-06T20:16:06Z		bio059189		5	11		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35142342 PMCID: PMC9167625					ALX; Animals; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Ethanol; Face; Fetal alcohol syndrome; Frontonasal dysplasia; Neural crest; Ocular anterior segment; Zebrafish

Gage	Regeneration of Jaw Joint Cartilage in Adult Zebrafish	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2021.777787		The poor intrinsic repair capacity of mammalian joint cartilage likely contributes to the high incidence of arthritis worldwide. Adult zebrafish can regenerate many structures that show limited or no healing capacity in mammals, including the jawbone. To test whether zebrafish can also regenerate damaged joints, we developed a surgical injury model in which the zebrafish jaw joint is destabilized via transection of the major jaw joint ligament, the interopercular-mandibular (IOM). Unilateral transection of the IOM ligament in 1-year-old fish resulted in an initial reduction of jaw joint cartilage by 14 days, with full regeneration of joint cartilage by 28 days. Joint cartilage regeneration involves the re-entry of articular chondrocytes into the cell cycle and the upregulated expression of sox10, a marker of developing chondrocytes in the embryo that becomes restricted to a subset of joint chondrocytes in adults. Genetic ablation of these sox10-expressing chondrocytes shows that they are essential for joint cartilage regeneration. To uncover the potential source of new chondrocytes during joint regeneration, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the uninjured adult jaw joint and identified multiple skeletal, connective tissue, and fibroblast subtypes. In particular, we uncovered a joint-specific periosteal population expressing coch and grem1a, with the jaw joint chondrocytes marked by grem1a expression during regeneration. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of zebrafish to regenerate adult joint cartilage and identify candidate cell types that can be tested for their roles in regenerative response.	2021	2024-03-06 20:16:05	2024-03-06T20:16:05Z		777787			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35127702 PMCID: PMC8811260					cartilage; joint; osteoarthritis; regeneration; zebrafish

RNA methylations, including newly identified m1A, m5C, m6A and m7G, are important epigenetic modifications. However, how these modifications are distributed in the transcriptome of vertebrate brains and whether their abundance is altered under pathological conditions are still poorly understood. In this study, we chose the model animal of zebrafish to conduct a systematic study to investigate the mRNA methylation atlas in the brain. RESULTS: By performing unbiased analyses of the m1A, m5C, m6A and m7G methylation of mRNA, we found that within the whole brain transcriptome, with the increase of the gene expression levels, the overall level of each of these four modifications on the related genes was also progressively increased. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that the zebrafish brain has an abundance of m1A modifications. In the hypoxia-treated zebrafish brains, the proportion of m1A is decreased, affecting the RNA splicing and zebrafish endogenous retroviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first comprehensive atlas of m1A, m5C, m6A and m7G in the epitranscriptome of the zebrafish brain and reveals the distribution of these modifications in mRNA under hypoxic conditions. These data provide an invaluable resource for further research on the involvement of m1A, m5C, m6A and m7G in the regulation of miRNA and repeat elements in vertebrates, and provide new thoughts to study the brain hypoxic injury on the aspect of epitranscriptome.	2022-02-08	2024-03-06 20:16:05	2024-03-06T20:16:05Z		105		1	23		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35135476 PMCID: PMC8822802					Animals; Brain; Hypoxia; Methylation; RNA methylation; Retroviruses; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; miRNA

In zebrafish, knockout of the RCS detoxifying enzymes glyoxalase 1 (Glo 1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3a1 (Aldh3a1) and aldo-ketoreductase 1a1a (Akr1a1a) showed a signature of elevated RCS which specifically regulated glucose metabolism, hyperglycemia and diabetic organ damage. aldh2.1 was compensatory upregulated in glo1-/- animals and therefore this study aimed to investigate the detoxification ability for RCS by Aldh2.1 in zebrafish independent of ethanol exposure. aldh2.1 knockout zebrafish were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and subsequently analyzed on a histological, metabolomic and transcriptomic level. aldh2.1-/- zebrafish displayed increased endogenous acetaldehyde (AA) inducing an increased angiogenesis in retinal vasculature. Expression and pharmacological interventional studies identified an imbalance of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK induced by AA, which mediate an activation of angiogenesis. Moreover, increased AA in aldh2.1-/- zebrafish did not induce hyperglycemia, instead AA inhibited the expression of glucokinase (gck) and glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pc), which led to an impaired glucose metabolism. In conclusion, the data have identified AA as the preferred substrate for Aldh2.1's detoxification ability, which subsequently causes microvascular organ damage and impaired glucose metabolism.	2022-04	2024-03-06 20:16:05	2024-03-06T20:16:05Z		102249			50		Redox Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35114580 PMCID: PMC8818574					Acetaldehyde; Acetaldehyde (AA); Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial; Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH); Animals; Glucose; Glucose metabolism; Microvascular organ complications; Reactive carbonyl species (RCS); Retinal Neovascularization; Retinal Vessels; Zebrafish

In this study, we investigate whether knockout of pdx1 also leads to diabetic kidney disease (DKD). pdx1-/- larvae exhibit several signs of early DKD, such as glomerular hypertrophy, impairments in the filtration barrier corresponding to microalbuminuria, and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening. Adult pdx1-/- mutants show progressive GBM thickening in comparison with the larval state. Heterozygous pdx1 knockout also leads to glomerular hypertrophy as initial establishment of DKD similar to the pdx1-/- larvae. RNA sequencing of adult pdx1+/- kidneys uncovered regulations in multiple expected diabetic pathways related to podocyte disruption and hinting at early vascular dysregulation without obvious morphological alterations. Metabolome analysis and pharmacological intervention experiments revealed the contribution of phosphatidylethanolamine in the early establishment of kidney damage. In conclusion, this study identified the pdx1 mutant as a novel model for the study of DKD, showing signs of the early disease progression already in the larval stage and several selective features of later DKD in adult mutants.	2022-05-01	2024-03-06 20:16:05	2024-03-06T20:16:05Z		1073-1080		5	71		Diabetes								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35100334					Animals; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; Female; Glomerular Basement Membrane; Humans; Hypertrophy; Male; Phenotype; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Podocytes; Zebrafish

Geoffrey	Latent TGFβ-binding proteins 1 and 3 protect the larval zebrafish outflow tract from aneurysmal dilatation	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.046979		Aortic root aneurysm is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in Loeys-Dietz and Marfan syndromes, where perturbations in transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling play a causal or contributory role, respectively. Despite the advantages of cross-species disease modeling, animal models of aortic root aneurysm are largely restricted to genetically engineered mice. Here, we report that zebrafish devoid of the genes encoding latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 and 3 (ltbp1 and ltbp3, respectively) develop rapid and severe aneurysm of the outflow tract (OFT), the aortic root equivalent. Similar to syndromic aneurysm tissue, the distended OFTs display evidence for paradoxical hyperactivated TGFβ signaling. RNA-sequencing revealed significant overlap between the molecular signatures of disease tissue from mutant zebrafish and a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Moreover, chemical inhibition of TGFβ signaling in wild-type animals phenocopied mutants but chemical activation did not, demonstrating that TGFβ signaling is protective against aneurysm. Human relevance is supported by recent studies implicating genetic lesions in LTBP3 and, potentially, LTBP1 as heritable causes of aortic root aneurysm. Ultimately, our data demonstrate that zebrafish can now be leveraged to interrogate thoracic aneurysmal disease and identify novel lead compounds through small-molecule suppressor screens.

Primitive erythrocytes are thought to be generated from bipotent hemangioblasts, but the molecular basis remains unclear. Transcriptional repressors Gfi1aa and Gfi1b have been shown to cooperatively promote primitive erythrocytes differentiation from hemangioblasts in zebrafish. However, the mechanism of these repressors during the primitive wave is largely unknown. Herein, by functional analysis of zebrafish gfi1aa smu10 , gfi1b smu11 , gfi1ab smu12 single, double, and triple mutants, we found that Gfi1aa not only plays a predominant role in primitive erythropoiesis but also synergizes with Gfi1ab. To screen Gfi1aa downstream targets, we performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis and found two endothelial transcription factors, etv2 and sox7, to be repressed by Gfi1aa. Genetic analysis demonstrated Gfi1aa to promote hemangioblast differentiation into primitive erythrocytes by inhibiting both etv2 and sox7 in an Lsd1-dependent manner. Moreover, the H3K4me1 level of etv2 and sox7 were increased in gfi1aa mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that Gfi1aa/Lsd1-dependent etv2/sox7 downregulation is critical for hemangioblast differentiation during primitive hematopoiesis by inhibition of endothelial specification. The different and redundant roles for Gfi1(s), as well as their genetic and epigenetic regulation during primitive hematopoiesis, help us to better know the molecular basis of the primitive hematopoiesis and sheds light on the understanding the Gfi1(s) related pathogenesis.	2021	2024-03-06 20:16:04	2024-03-06T20:16:04Z		786426			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35096818 PMCID: PMC8790037					Gfi1aa; etv2; hemangioblast differentiation; primitive erythrocyte; sox7; zebrafish

However, the cellular dynamics underlying this capability remain unexplored. Here, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to map de novo β-cell regeneration during induction and recovery from diabetes in zebrafish. We show that the zebrafish has evolved two distinct types of somatostatin-producing δ-cells, which we term δ1- and δ2-cells. Moreover, we characterize a small population of glucose-responsive islet cells, which share the hormones and fate-determinants of both β- and δ1-cells. The transcriptomic analysis of β-cell regeneration reveals that β/δ hybrid cells provide a prominent source of insulin expression during diabetes recovery. Using in vivo calcium imaging and cell tracking, we further show that the hybrid cells form de novo and acquire glucose-responsiveness in the course of regeneration. The overexpression of dkk3, a gene enriched in hybrid cells, increases their formation in the absence of β-cell injury. Finally, interspecies comparison shows that plastic δ1-cells are partially related to PP cells in the human pancreas. Our work provides an atlas of β-cell regeneration and indicates that the rapid formation of glucose-responsive hybrid cells contributes to the resolution of diabetes in zebrafish.	2022-01-15	2024-03-06 20:16:03	2024-03-06T20:16:03Z		dev199853		2	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35088828					Animals; Beta-cell; Calcium; Cell fate; Cell plasticity; Diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus; Gamma-cell; Glucose; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Pancreas; Regeneration; Single cell; Single-Cell Analysis; Somatostatin-Secreting Cells; Zebrafish

To overcome the weak regenerative capacity of mammals, we used regeneration-prone zebrafish to study β-cells arising following destruction. We show that most new insulin cells differ from the original β-cells as they coexpress Somatostatin and Insulin. These bihormonal cells are abundant, functional and able to normalize glycemia. Their formation in response to β-cell destruction is fast, efficient, and age-independent. Bihormonal cells are transcriptionally close to a subset of δ-cells that we identified in control islets and that are characterized by the expression of somatostatin 1.1 (sst1.1) and by genes essential for glucose-induced Insulin secretion in β-cells such as pdx1, slc2a2 and gck. We observed in vivo the conversion of monohormonal sst1.1-expressing cells to sst1.1+ ins + bihormonal cells following β-cell destruction. Our findings support the conclusion that sst1.1 δ-cells possess a pro-β identity enabling them to contribute to the neogenesis of Insulin-producing cells during regeneration. This work unveils that abundant and functional bihormonal cells benefit to diabetes recovery in zebrafish.	2022-01-21	2024-03-06 20:16:03	2024-03-06T20:16:03Z		e67576			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35060900 PMCID: PMC8820734					Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Female; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Pancreas; Somatostatin; Somatostatin-Secreting Cells; Zebrafish; cell biology; diabetes; insulin; pancreas; regeneration; somatostatin; zebrafish

Recent studies have revealed that codon composition in the open reading frame determines mRNA stability in multiple organisms. Based on genome-wide correlation approaches, this previously unrecognized role for the genetic code is attributable to the kinetics of the codon-decoding process by the ribosome. However, complementary experimental analyses are required to clarify the codon effects on mRNA stability and the related cotranslational mRNA decay pathways, for example, those triggered by aberrant ribosome stalling. In the current study, we performed a set of reporter-based analyses to define codon-mediated mRNA decay and ribosome stall-dependent mRNA decay in zebrafish embryos. Our analysis showed that the effect of codons on mRNA stability stems from the decoding process, independent of the ribosome quality control factor Znf598 and stalling-dependent mRNA decay. We propose that codon-mediated mRNA decay is rather triggered by transiently slowed ribosomes engaging in a productive translation cycle in zebrafish embryos.	2022-03-01	2024-03-06 20:16:03	2024-03-06T20:16:03Z		e109256		5	41		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35040509 PMCID: PMC8886528					Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Codon; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; Quality Control; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; Ribosomes; Zebrafish; codons; mRNA degradation; ribosome; tRNA; zebrafish

A population of dI6 interneurons, marked by the Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (Dmrt3), has been shown to participate in the coordination of locomotion and gaits in horses, mice and zebrafish. Analyses of Dmrt3 neurons based on morphology, functionality and the expression of transcription factors have identified different subtypes. Here we analyzed the transcriptomes of individual cells belonging to the Dmrt3 lineage from zebrafish and mice to unravel the molecular code that underlies their subfunctionalization. Indeed, clustering of Dmrt3 neurons based on their gene expression verified known subtypes and revealed novel populations expressing unique markers. Differences in birth order, differential expression of axon guidance genes, neurotransmitters, and their receptors, as well as genes affecting electrophysiological properties, were identified as factors likely underlying diversity. In addition, the comparison between fish and mice populations offers insights into the evolutionary driven subspecialization concomitant with the emergence of limbed locomotion.	2021	2024-03-06 20:16:02	2024-03-06T20:16:02Z		781197			15		Front Cell Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35002627 PMCID: PMC8733252					Wt1a; development; dmrt3a; locomotor network; spinal cord

Gage	Lifelong single-cell profiling of cranial neural crest diversification in zebrafish	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-021-27594-w		The cranial neural crest generates a huge diversity of derivatives, including the bulk of connective and skeletal tissues of the vertebrate head. How neural crest cells acquire such extraordinary lineage potential remains unresolved. By integrating single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of cranial neural crest-derived cells across the zebrafish lifetime, we observe progressive and region-specific establishment of enhancer accessibility for distinct fates. Neural crest-derived cells rapidly diversify into specialized progenitors, including multipotent skeletal progenitors, stromal cells with a regenerative signature, fibroblasts with a unique metabolic signature linked to skeletal integrity, and gill-specific progenitors generating cell types for respiration. By retrogradely mapping the emergence of lineage-specific chromatin accessibility, we identify a wealth of candidate lineage-priming factors, including a Gata3 regulatory circuit for respiratory cell fates. Rather than multilineage potential being established during cranial neural crest specification, our findings support progressive and region-specific chromatin remodeling underlying acquisition of diverse potential.	2022-01-10	2024-03-06 20:16:02	2024-03-06T20:16:02Z		13		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35013168 PMCID: PMC8748784					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neural Crest; Single-Cell Analysis; Skull; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

The manner in which cell plasticity impacts wound healing remains to be determined. In this study, we report rapid wound closure after zebrafish corneal epithelium abrasion. Furthermore, by investigating the cellular and molecular events taking place during corneal epithelial closure, we show the induction of a bilateral response to a unilateral wound. Our transcriptomic results, together with our TGF-beta receptor inhibition experiments, demonstrate conclusively the crucial role of TGF-beta signaling in corneal wound healing. Finally, our results on Pax6 expression and bilateral wound healing, demonstrate the decisive impact of epithelial cell plasticity on the pace of healing. Altogether, our study describes terminally differentiated cell competencies in the healing of an injured cornea. These findings will enhance the translation of research on cell plasticity to organ regeneration.	2022-01-07	2024-03-06 20:16:02	2024-03-06T20:16:02Z		161		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34997071 PMCID: PMC8741998					Animals; Cell Plasticity; Corneal Injuries; Disease Models, Animal; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium, Corneal; PAX6 Transcription Factor; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Effect of Long-Term Consumption of Poultry Egg Products on Growth, Body Composition, and Liver Gene Expression in Zebrafish, Danio rerio	Current Developments in Nutrition		2475-2991	10.1093/cdn/nzab134		BACKGROUND: Poultry eggs are a low-cost, high-protein nutrient package that can be consumed as part of quality diets. However, consumption of poultry egg products is historically contentious, which highlights the importance of investigating impacts of long-term egg consumption on metabolic health. OBJECTIVE: Our study utilized the zebrafish, Danio rerio, a newly defined model of human metabolic health, to understand the metabolic consequence of consuming egg products in lieu of other well-described protein sources. METHODS: Reference diets were formulated to contain multisource protein with casein and fish protein hydrolysate (CON; control protein sources), the protein sources that have been historically utilized in numerous reference diets. These proteins were then partially replaced with either whole egg (WE; protein and lipid source), egg white (EW; protein source), wheat gluten (WG; cereal protein source), or a high-lipid-content diet containing a multisource protein with casein and fish protein hydrolysate (HFCON; isonitrogenous and isolipidic with the WE diet) in a 34-wk trial (n = 8 tanks, 10 fish per tank). Daily feeding was initiated at the early juvenile life stage and terminated at the late reproductive adult stage. RESULTS: The amino acid composition of control versus egg product diets did not vary substantially, although methionine and lysine were apparently limiting in fish fed WG. At termination, fish fed EW as the protein source had weight gain and body composition similar to those fed the CON diet. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose did not differ between any dietary treatment. Assessment of the liver transcriptome using RNAseq revealed no differential gene expression between zebrafish fed CON or WE diets. Zebrafish fed WG had lower weight gain in males. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term consumption of egg products promoted metabolic health equal to that of historically relevant proteins. These data support the value of egg products for maintaining long-term metabolic health in animal diets.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:16:02	2024-03-06T20:16:02Z		nzab134		12	5		Curr Dev Nutr								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34993387 PMCID: PMC8718328					blood glucose; diet; egg; nutrition; transcriptome; zebrafish

RESULTS: We found that zebrafish tp53 mutant larvae exhibited elevated intestinal inflammation, by monitoring the NFκB activity in the mid-distal intestines of zebrafish larvae using an NFκB:EGFP transgenic reporter line in vivo as well as neutrophil infiltration into the intestine. This inflammation was due to dysbiotic gut microbiota with reduced diversity, revealed using both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a germfree larva model. In this dysbiosis, Aeromonas spp. were aberrantly enriched as major pathobionts and exhibited the capacity for aggressive colonization in tp53 mutants. Importantly, the ex-germfree experiments supported the causality of the host tp53 mutation for inducing the inflammation. Transcriptome and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses of the host gastrointestinal tracts identified dysregulated sialic acid (SA) metabolism concomitant with increased host Neu5Gc levels as the key determinant of aberrant inflammation, which was reversed by the sialidase inhibitors oseltamivir and Philippin A. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a crucial role for host tp53 in maintaining symbiosis and immune homeostasis via SA metabolism. Disturbed SA metabolism via a tp53 mutation may be exploited by specific elements of the gut microbiome, eliciting both dysbiosis and inflammation. Manipulating sialometabolism may therefore provide an efficacious therapeutic strategy for tp53 mutation-induced dysbiosis, inflammation, and ultimately, related cancers.

Curiously, mouse neonates and zebrafish can regenerate their hearts via cardiomyocyte de-differentiation and proliferation. However, a molecular mechanism of why these cardiomyocytes can re-enter cell cycle is poorly understood. Here, we identify a unique metabolic state that primes adult zebrafish and neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes to proliferate. Zebrafish and neonatal mouse hearts display elevated glutamine levels, predisposing them to amino-acid-driven activation of TOR, and that TOR activation is required for zebrafish cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo. Through a multi-omics approach with cellular validation we identify metabolic and mitochondrial changes during the first week of regeneration. These data suggest that regeneration of zebrafish myocardium is driven by metabolic remodeling and reveals a unique metabolic regulator, TOR-primed state, in which zebrafish and mammalian cardiomyocytes are regeneration competent.	2022-01-21	2024-03-06 20:16:01	2024-03-06T20:16:01Z		103574		1	25		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34988408 PMCID: PMC8704488					Biological sciences; Cell biology; Tissue Engineering

However, the role of zinc during PA differentiation from NC progenitor cells is unknown. Here, we found that the metal transporters Slc30a1a and Slc30a1b mediate zinc homeostasis during PA differentiation. Slc30a1-deficient zebrafish develop zinc accumulation in NC cells, with increased expression of stemness markers and PA dorsal genes, and SMART-seq analyses revealed that the genes snai2 and jag1b may serve as downstream targets. Furthermore, functional studies showed that knocking down either snai2 or jag1b rescues PA development in Slc30a1-deficient zebrafish. Notably, we identified the double zinc-finger domain in the transcription factor Snai2 as a zinc-responsive element that regulates jag1b expression. Our findings indicate that the Slc30a1/zinc-snai2-jag1b axis is an essential regulatory network controlling PA differentiation, shedding new light on the function of zinc homeostasis in maintaining NC cell stemness and multipotency in vertebrates.	2021-12	2024-03-06 20:16:00	2024-03-06T20:16:00Z		778-797		4	2		MedComm (2020)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34977877 PMCID: PMC8706747					Slc30a1; neural crest; pharyngeal arch; zebrafish; zinc homeostasis

Establishment of developmental gene silencing by ordered polycomb complex recruitment in early zebrafish embryos	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.67738		Vertebrate embryos achieve developmental competency during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) by establishing chromatin states that silence yet poise developmental genes for subsequent lineage-specific activation. Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with 'Placeholder' nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 - establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.	2022-01-04	2024-03-06 20:16:00	2024-03-06T20:16:00Z		e67738			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34982026 PMCID: PMC8769650					Animals; Cell Line; Chromatin; DNA Methylation; Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Silencing; Genes, Developmental; Genomics; Placeholder; Polycomb-Group Proteins; Zebrafish; Zygote; chromatin; chromosomes; development; developmental biology; gene expression; polycomb; ubiquitylation; zebrafish; zygotic genome activation

Different cell types of the liver are known to play distinct roles in liver injury response. Hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells receive molecular signals indicating tissue injury and activate hepatic stellate cells which produce ECM proteins upon their activation. Despite the growing knowledge on the molecular mechanism underlying hepatic fibrosis in general, the cell-type-specific gene regulatory network associated with the initial response to hepatotoxic injury is still poorly characterized. RESULTS: In this study, we used thioacetamide (TAA) to induce hepatic injury in adult zebrafish. We isolated three major liver cell types - hepatocytes, endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells - and identified cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional changes in an early stage of liver injury. We found that TAA induced transcriptional shifts in all three cell types hallmarked by significant alterations in the expression of genes related to fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as immune response-associated and vascular-specific genes. Interestingly, liver endothelial cells exhibit the most pronounced response to liver injury at the transcriptome and chromatin level, hallmarked by the loss of their angiogenic phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our results uncovered cell-type-specific transcriptome and epigenome responses to early stage liver injury, which provide valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanism implicated in the early response of the liver to pro-fibrotic signals.	2021-12-18	2024-03-06 20:15:59	2024-03-06T20:15:59Z		904		1	22		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34920711 PMCID: PMC8684102					ATAC-seq; Animals; Chromatin; Endothelial Cells; Endothelial cells; Epigenomics; Genomics; Hepatocytes; Liver; RNA-seq; Stellate cells; Transcriptomics; Zebrafish

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish cranial neural crest reveals spatiotemporal regulation of lineage decisions during development	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110140		Neural crest (NC) cells migrate throughout vertebrate embryos to give rise to a huge variety of cell types, but when and where lineages emerge and their regulation remain unclear. We have performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of cranial NC cells from the first pharyngeal arch in zebrafish over several stages during migration. Computational analysis combining pseudotime and real-time data reveals that these NC cells first adopt a transitional state, becoming specified mid-migration, with the first lineage decisions being skeletal and pigment, followed by neural and glial progenitors. In addition, by computationally integrating these data with RNA-seq data from a transgenic Wnt reporter line, we identify gene cohorts with similar temporal responses to Wnts during migration and show that one, Atp6ap2, is required for melanocyte differentiation. Together, our results show that cranial NC cell lineages arise progressively and uncover a series of spatially restricted cell interactions likely to regulate such cell-fate decisions.	2021-12-21	2024-03-06 20:15:59	2024-03-06T20:15:59Z		110140		12	37		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34936864 PMCID: PMC8741273					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Branchial Region; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Movement; Cranial Nerves; Danio rerio; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Neural Crest; RNA-Seq; Signal Transduction; Single-Cell Analysis; Wnt; Wnt Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cell fate; neural crest; single-cell RNA-seq

It remains puzzling why postfertilization global DNA reprogramming occurs in mammals but not in nonmammalian vertebrates. In zebrafish, global methylome inheritance is however accompanied by extensive enhancer “dememorization” as they become fully methylated. By depleting maternal dnmt1 using oocyte microinjection, we eliminated DNA methylation in early embryos, which died around gastrulation with severe differentiation defects. Notably, methylation deficiency leads to derepression of adult tissue–specific genes and CG-rich enhancers, which acquire ectopic transcription factor binding and, unexpectedly, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). By contrast, embryonic enhancers are generally CG-poor and evade DNA methylation repression. Hence, global DNA hypermethylation inheritance coupled with enhancer dememorization installs an epigenetic gate that safeguards embryonic programs and ensures temporally ordered gene expression. We propose that “enhancer dememorization” underlies and unifies distinct epigenetic reprogramming modes in early development between mammals and nonmammals.	2021-12-24	2024-03-06 20:15:59	2024-03-06T20:15:59Z		eabl3858		52	7		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34936444 PMCID: PMC8694617

The intrinsic mechanisms underlying re-wiring of spinal neural circuits and recovery of locomotion after SCI are unclear. Zebrafish shows axonal regeneration and functional recovery after SCI making it a robust model to study mechanisms of regeneration. Here, we use a two-cut SCI model to investigate whether recovery of locomotion can occur independently of supraspinal connections. Using this injury model, we show that injury induces the localization of a specialized group of intraspinal serotonergic neurons (ISNs), with distinctive molecular and cellular properties, at the injury site. This subpopulation of ISNs have hyperactive terminal varicosities constantly releasing serotonin activating 5-HT1B receptors, resulting in axonal regrowth of spinal interneurons. Axon regrowth of excitatory interneurons is more pronounced compared to inhibitory interneurons. Knock-out of htr1b prevents axon regrowth of spinal excitatory interneurons, negatively affecting coordination of rostral-caudal body movements and restoration of locomotor function. On the other hand, treatment with 5-HT1B receptor agonizts promotes functional recovery following SCI. In summary, our data show an intraspinal mechanism where a subpopulation of ISNs stimulates axonal regrowth resulting in improved recovery of locomotor functions following SCI in zebrafish.	2021-12-07	2024-03-06 20:15:58	2024-03-06T20:15:58Z		7093		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34876587 PMCID: PMC8651775					Animals; Axons; Electrophysiology; Interneurons; Locomotion; Receptors, Serotonin; Recovery of Function; Serotonergic Neurons; Serotonin; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Zebrafish

It is encoded by a gene spanning 180 kb on chromosome 20p13, a region previously implicated in schizophrenia by linkage studies. To address a possible role of ATRN in disorders of the central nervous system, we created an atrn knockout zebrafish line and performed behavioral tests. Adult atrn-/- zebrafish exhibited more pronounced attack behavior relative to wild-type control zebrafish in a tracking analysis. Biochemical analysis revealed elevated testosterone levels in atrn-/- zebrafish. At the gene expression level, we noted an upregulation of cyp51 and hsd17b7, key proteins in testosterone synthesis in the brains of both adult and larvae of atrn-/- zebrafish. In order to further elucidate the relationship between testosterone and behavioral syndromes, we then compared testosterone levels of 9,008 psychiatric patients and 247 healthy controls from the same catchment area. Of all subjects examined, male subjects with schizophrenia exhibited lower testosterone levels compared with controls. In contrast, female subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder featured higher testosterone levels than did same sex controls. Purposeful sampling of extreme groups showed reduced ATRN expression in a subset of these subjects. Finally, we identified 14 subjects with ATRN mutations. All of whom displayed abnormal testosterone levels. In summary, the interplay of ATRN and testosterone may help to explain sexual dimorphisms in selected behavioral phenotypes.	2021	2024-03-06 20:15:58	2024-03-06T20:15:58Z		755165			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34869343 PMCID: PMC8636034					ATRN; behavior; schizophrenia; testosterone; zebrafish

Vascular endothelial growth factor c regulates hematopoietic stem cell fate in the dorsal aorta	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.199498		Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are multipotent cells that self-renew or differentiate to establish the entire blood hierarchy. HSPCs arise from the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA) during development in a process called endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. The factors and signals that control HSPC fate decisions from the hemogenic endothelium are not fully understood. We found that Vegfc has a role in HSPC emergence from the zebrafish DA. Using time-lapse live imaging, we show that some HSPCs in the DA of vegfc loss-of-function embryos display altered cellular behavior. Instead of typical budding from the DA, emergent HSPCs exhibit crawling behavior similar to myeloid cells. This was confirmed by increased myeloid cell marker expression in the ventral wall of the DA and the caudal hematopoietic tissue. This increase in myeloid cells corresponded with a decrease in HSPCs that persisted into larval stages. Together, our data suggest that Vegfc regulates HSPC emergence in the hemogenic endothelium, in part by suppressing a myeloid cell fate. Our study provides a potential signal for modulation of HSPC fate in stem cell differentiation protocols.	2022-01-15	2024-03-06 20:15:58	2024-03-06T20:15:58Z		dev199498		2	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34919128 PMCID: PMC8917412					Animals; Aorta; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Dorsal aorta; Endothelium, Vascular; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Hematopoietic stem cells; Hemogenic endothelium; Loss of Function Mutation; Myeloid Cells; VEGFC; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, current conclusions are mostly obtained based on cell population-average responses. Heterogeneity effects among cell populations in aquatic organisms remain unclear. This study firstly analyzed the basic toxic effects of 20 μg L-1, 200 μg L-1 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs), 50 μg L-1 lead (Pb), and their combined exposures on zebrafish intestine. Results found that combined exposure of 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs and 50 μg L-1 Pb induced highest MDA, 8-OHdG, and TNF-α levels. Thus 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs, 50 μg L-1 Pb and their combined exposures were chosen to analyze the heterogeneity effects on zebrafish intestine cells by single-cell RNA sequencing. A total of 38,640 zebrafish intestinal cells were obtained and identified as seven cell populations, including enterocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, B cells, T cells, enteroendocrine cells, and goblet cells. 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs exposure had the greatest influence on macrophages, while Pb exposure mostly influenced enterocytes. Results of MDA, 8-OHdG, and TNF-α analyses indicated that 20 μg L-1 and 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs increased the Pb toxicity. However, the scRNA-seq showed that the synergistic effects did not exist in most cell populations, except for goblet cells. Co-exposure of 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs and Pb caused similar transcriptome profiles with 200 μg L-1 PS-NPs exposure in macrophages, which changed immunological recognition and apoptosis processes. The Pb exposure influenced the macrophages by direct cytotoxicity. However, the Pb alone and combined exposures induced similar toxicities in the enterocytes, including the generation of oxidative stress and abnormality of lipid metabolism. This study shows the scRNA-seq is a powerful method to identify the target cell populations and corresponding toxic effects during combined exposure of pollutants.	2022-02	2024-03-06 20:15:58	2024-03-06T20:15:58Z		133133			289		Chemosphere								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34861263					Animals; Enterocytes; Intestines; Lead; Macrophages; Microplastics; Nanoparticles; Polystyrene nanoplastics; Polystyrenes; ScRNA-seq; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

Still, the gene regulatory cascade triggered by RA in the endoderm remains poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated this regulatory network in zebrafish by combining RNA-seq, RAR ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq assays. By analysing the effect of RA and of the RA receptor (RAR) inverse-agonist BMS493 on the transcriptome and on the chromatin accessibility of endodermal cells, we identified a large set of genes and regulatory regions regulated by RA signalling. RAR ChIP-seq further defined the direct RAR target genes in zebrafish, including hox genes as well as several pancreatic regulators like mnx1, insm1b, hnf1ba and gata6. Comparison of zebrafish and murine RAR ChIP-seq data highlighted the conserved direct target genes and revealed that some RAR sites are under strong evolutionary constraints. Among them, a novel highly conserved RAR-induced enhancer was identified downstream of the HoxB locus and driving expression in the nervous system and in the gut in a RA-dependent manner. Finally, ATAC-seq data unveiled the role of the RAR-direct targets Hnf1ba and Gata6 in opening chromatin at many regulatory loci upon RA treatment.	2021-11-22	2024-03-06 20:15:57	2024-03-06T20:15:57Z		22717		1	11		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34811400 PMCID: PMC8608873					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; GATA Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genomics; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Homeodomain Proteins; Mice; Pancreas; RNA-Seq; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Tretinoin; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

However, it is unknown whether 5′tRFls could feed back to regulate tRNA biogenesis. Here, we show that 5′tRFlGly/GCC and 5′tRFlGlu/CTC function to promote transcription of corresponding tRNA genes and are essential for vertebrate early embryogenesis. During zebrafish embryogenesis, dynamics of 5′tRFlGly/GCC and 5′tRFlGlu/CTC levels correlates with that of tRNAGly/GCC and tRNAGlu/CTC levels. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of 5′tRFlGly/GCC or 5′tRFlGlu/CTC down-regulates tRNAGly/GCC or tRNAGlu/CTC levels, respectively, and causes embryonic lethality that is efficiently rescued by coinjection of properly refolded corresponding tRNA. In zebrafish embryos, tRNA:DNA and 5′tRFl:DNA hybrids commonly exist on the template strand of tRNA genes. Mechanistically, unstable 5′tRFl:DNA hybrid may prevent the formation of transcriptionally inhibitory stable tRNA:DNA hybrids on the same tRNA loci so as to facilitate tRNA gene transcription. The uncovered mechanism may be implicated in other physiological and pathological processes.	2021-11-19	2024-03-06 20:15:57	2024-03-06T20:15:57Z		eabh0494		47	7		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34797706 PMCID: PMC8604414

Transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility in zebrafish melanocytes and melanoma tumors	G3 (Bethesda, Md.)		2160-1836	10.1093/g3journal/jkab379		Transcriptional and epigenetic characterization of melanocytes and melanoma cells isolated from their in vivo context promises to unveil key differences between these developmentally related normal and cancer cell populations. We therefore engineered an enhanced Danio rerio (zebrafish) melanoma model with fluorescently labeled melanocytes to allow for isolation of normal (wild type) and premalignant (BRAFV600E-mutant) populations for comparison to fully transformed BRAFV600E-mutant, p53 loss-of-function melanoma cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate these populations, we performed high-quality RNA- and ATAC-seq on sorted zebrafish melanocytes vs. melanoma cells, which we provide as a resource here. Melanocytes had consistent transcriptional and accessibility profiles, as did melanoma cells. Comparing melanocytes and melanoma, we note 4128 differentially expressed genes and 56,936 differentially accessible regions with overall gene expression profiles analogous to human melanocytes and the pigmentation melanoma subtype. Combining the RNA- and ATAC-seq data surprisingly revealed that increased chromatin accessibility did not always correspond with increased gene expression, suggesting that though there is widespread dysregulation in chromatin accessibility in melanoma, there is a potentially more refined gene expression program driving cancerous melanoma. These data serve as a resource to identify candidate regulators of the normal vs. diseased states in a genetically controlled in vivo context.	2022-01-04	2024-03-06 20:15:57	2024-03-06T20:15:57Z		jkab379		1	12		G3 (Bethesda)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34791221 PMCID: PMC8727958					ATAC-seq; Animals; Chromatin; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; Humans; Melanocytes; Melanoma; RNA-seq; Zebrafish; melanocytes; melanoma; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
38X7I5ID	journalArticle	2021	Kramer, Ashley C.; Gurdziel, Katherine; Thummel, Ryan	A Comparative Analysis of Gene and Protein Expression Throughout a Full 28-Day Retinal Regeneration Time-Course in Adult Zebrafish	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2021.741514		Following photoreceptors ablation by intense light exposure, adult zebrafish are capable of complete regeneration due to the ability of their Müller glia (MG) to re-enter the cell cycle, creating progenitors that differentiate into new photoreceptors. The majority of previous reports on retinal regeneration focused on the first few days of the regenerative response, which include MG cell-cycle re-entry and progenitor cell proliferation. With this study, we analyzed the full 28-day time-course of regeneration by pairing a detailed morphological/immunological analysis with RNA-seq transcriptional profiling at 8 key time points during retinal regeneration. We observed several novel findings. First, we provide evidence for two separate peaks of MG gliosis, with the secondary gliotic peak occurring after MG cell-cycle re-entry. Second, we highlight a distinct transcriptional shift between 5- and 10-days post lesion that highlights the transition from progenitor proliferation to differentiation into new photoreceptors. Third, we show distinctly different patterns of transcriptional recovery of the photoreceptor opsins at 28 days post lesion. Finally, using differential gene expression analysis, we revealed that the established functional recovery of the retina at 28 days post lesion does not, in fact, return to an undamaged transcriptional state, potentially redefining what the field considers complete regeneration. Together, to our knowledge, this work represents the first histological and transcriptomic map of a 28-day time-course of retinal regeneration in adult zebrafish.	2021	2024-03-06 20:15:57	2024-03-06T20:15:57Z		741514			9		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34790663 PMCID: PMC8591265					3′RNA-seq; Müller glia; gliosis; regeneration; retina; stem cell

Smad4 controls signaling robustness and morphogenesis by differentially contributing to the Nodal and BMP pathways	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-021-26486-3		The transcriptional effector SMAD4 is a core component of the TGF-β family signaling pathways. However, its role in vertebrate embryo development remains unresolved. To address this, we deleted Smad4 in zebrafish and investigated the consequences of this on signaling by the TGF-β family morphogens, BMPs and Nodal. We demonstrate that in the absence of Smad4, dorsal/ventral embryo patterning is disrupted due to the loss of BMP signaling. However, unexpectedly, Nodal signaling is maintained, but lacks robustness. This Smad4-independent Nodal signaling is sufficient for mesoderm specification, but not for optimal endoderm specification. Furthermore, using Optical Projection Tomography in combination with 3D embryo morphometry, we have generated a BMP morphospace and demonstrate that Smad4 mutants are morphologically indistinguishable from embryos in which BMP signaling has been genetically/pharmacologically perturbed. Smad4 is thus differentially required for signaling by different TGF-β family ligands, which has implications for diseases where Smad4 is mutated or deleted.	2021-11-04	2024-03-06 20:15:56	2024-03-06T20:15:56Z		6374		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34737283 PMCID: PMC8569018					Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Embryonic Development; Endoderm; Gene Knockout Techniques; Mesoderm; Morphogenesis; Nodal Protein; Signal Transduction; Smad4 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Panx1b Modulates the Luminance Response and Direction of Locomotion in the Zebrafish	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms222111750		Pannexin1 (Panx1) can form ATP-permeable channels that play roles in the physiology of the visual system. In the zebrafish two ohnologs of Panx1, Panx1a and Panx1b, have unique and shared channel properties and tissue expression patterns. Panx1a channels are located in horizontal cells of the outer retina and modulate light decrement detection through an ATP/pH-dependent mechanisms and adenosine/dopamine signaling. Here, we decipher how the strategic localization of Panx1b channels in the inner retina and ganglion cell layer modulates visually evoked motor behavior. We describe a panx1b knockout model generated by TALEN technology. The RNA-seq analysis of 6 days post-fertilization larvae is confirmed by real-time PCR and paired with testing of locomotion behaviors by visual motor and optomotor response tests. We show that the loss of Panx1b channels disrupts the retinal response to an abrupt loss of illumination and it decreases the larval ability to follow leftward direction of locomotion in low light conditions. We concluded that the loss of Panx1b channels compromises the final output of luminance as well as motion detection. The Panx1b protein also emerges as a modulator of the circadian clock system. The disruption of the circadian clock system in mutants suggests that Panx1b could participate in non-image forming processes in the inner retina.	2021-10-29	2024-03-06 20:15:56	2024-03-06T20:15:56Z		11750		21	22		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34769181 PMCID: PMC8584175					Animals; Connexins; Motion Perception; Muller glia; RNA-Seq; Swimming; Vision, Ocular; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; behavior; circadian clock; pannexin1b; retinal ganglion cells; transcriptomics; visual system; zebrafish

Integrated molecular analysis identifies a conserved pericyte gene signature in zebrafish	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.200189		Pericytes reside in capillary beds where they share a basement membrane with endothelial cells and regulate their function. However, little is known about embryonic pericyte development, in part, due to lack of specific molecular markers and genetic tools. Here, we applied single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of platelet derived growth factor beta (pdgfrb)-positive cells to molecularly characterize pericytes in zebrafish larvae. scRNA-seq revealed zebrafish cells expressing mouse pericyte gene orthologs, and comparison with bulk RNA-seq from wild-type and pdgfrb mutant larvae further refined a pericyte gene set. Subsequent integration with mouse pericyte scRNA-seq profiles revealed a core set of conserved pericyte genes. Using transgenic reporter lines, we validated pericyte expression of two genes identified in our analysis: NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated like 2a (ndufa4l2a), and potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 4 (kcne4). Both reporter lines exhibited pericyte expression in multiple anatomical locations, and kcne4 was also detected in a subset of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, our integrated molecular analysis revealed a molecular profile for zebrafish pericytes and allowed us to develop new tools to observe these cells in vivo.	2021-12-01	2024-03-06 20:15:56	2024-03-06T20:15:56Z		dev200189		23	148		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34751773 PMCID: PMC8714063					Animals; Electron Transport Complex IV; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Mutation; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Pericyte; Pericytes; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Vascular development; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; pdgfrb

Resistance to inflammation underlies enhanced fitness in clonal hematopoiesis	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.aba9304		Clonal hematopoiesis results from enhanced fitness of a mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC), but how such clones expand is unclear. We developed a technique that combines mosaic mutagenesis with color labeling of HSPCs to study how acquired mutations affect clonal fitness in a native environment. Mutations in clonal hematopoiesis–associated genes such as asxl1 promoted clonal dominance. Single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that mutations stimulated expression of proinflammatory genes in mature myeloid cells and anti-inflammatory genes in progenitor cells of the mutant clone. Biallelic loss of one such immunomodulator, nr4a1, abrogated the ability of asxl1-mutant clones to establish clonal dominance. These results support a model where clonal fitness of mutant clones is driven by enhanced resistance to inflammatory signals from their mutant mature cell progeny.	2021-11-05	2024-03-06 20:15:55	2024-03-06T20:15:55Z		768-772		6568	374		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34735227					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Clonal Hematopoiesis; Cytokines; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases; Frameshift Mutation; Genes, p53; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Inflammation; Mutation; Myeloid Cells; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1; RNA-Seq; Repressor Proteins; Selection, Genetic; Single-Cell Analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Spatially resolved transcriptomics reveals the architecture of the tumor-microenvironment interface	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-021-26614-z		During tumor progression, cancer cells come into contact with various non-tumor cell types, but it is unclear how tumors adapt to these new environments. Here, we integrate spatially resolved transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and single-nucleus RNA-seq to characterize tumor-microenvironment interactions at the tumor boundary. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, we identify a distinct "interface" cell state where the tumor contacts neighboring tissues. This interface is composed of specialized tumor and microenvironment cells that upregulate a common set of cilia genes, and cilia proteins are enriched only where the tumor contacts the microenvironment. Cilia gene expression is regulated by ETS-family transcription factors, which normally act to suppress cilia genes outside of the interface. A cilia-enriched interface is conserved in human patient samples, suggesting it is a conserved feature of human melanoma. Our results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved transcriptomics in uncovering mechanisms that allow tumors to adapt to new environments.	2021-11-01	2024-03-06 20:15:55	2024-03-06T20:15:55Z		6278		1	12		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34725363 PMCID: PMC8560802					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Neoplasms; RNA-Seq; Transcriptome; Tumor Microenvironment; Zebrafish

This close interconnection makes it difficult to specify different functions of AAR and UPR. Here, we generated a zebrafish model in which loss of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (Tars) induces angiogenesis dependent on Tars aminoacylation activity. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the tars-mutant and wild-type embryos with/without Gcn2- or Perk-inhibition reveals that only Gcn2-mediated AAR is activated in the tars-mutants, whereas Perk functions predominantly in normal development. Mechanistic analysis shows that, while a considerable amount of eIF2α is normally phosphorylated by Perk, the loss of Tars causes an accumulation of uncharged tRNAThr, which in turn activates Gcn2, leading to phosphorylation of an extra amount of eIF2α. The partial switchover of kinases for eIF2α largely overwhelms the functions of Perk in normal development. Interestingly, although inhibition of Gcn2 and Perk in this stress condition both can reduce the eIF2α phosphorylation levels, their functional consequences in the regulation of target genes and in the rescue of the angiogenic phenotypes are dramatically different. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological manipulations of these pathways validate that the Gcn2-mediated AAR, but not the Perk-mediated UPR, is required for tars-deficiency induced angiogenesis. Thus, the interconnected AAR and UPR pathways differentially regulate angiogenesis through selective functions and mutual competitions, reflecting the specificity and efficiency of multiple stress response pathways that evolve integrally to enable an organism to sense/respond precisely to various types of stresses.	2021-10-26	2024-03-06 20:15:55	2024-03-06T20:15:55Z		98		1	7		Cell Discov								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34697290 PMCID: PMC8547220

Due to the growing evidence for ageing-related clinical and pathological commonalities between AD and PD, these diseases have recently been studied in tandem. In this study, we analysed transcriptomic data from AD and PD patients, and stratified these patients into three subclasses with distinct gene expression and metabolic profiles. Through integrating transcriptomic data with a genome-scale metabolic model and validating our findings by network exploration and co-analysis using a zebrafish ageing model, we identified retinoids as a key ageing-related feature in all subclasses of AD and PD. We also demonstrated that the dysregulation of androgen metabolism by three different independent mechanisms is a source of heterogeneity in AD and PD. Taken together, our work highlights the need for stratification of AD/PD patients and development of personalised and precision medicine approaches based on the detailed characterisation of these subclasses.	2021-09-24	2024-03-06 20:15:54	2024-03-06T20:15:54Z		1310		10	9		Biomedicines								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34680427 PMCID: PMC8533098					Alzheimer’s; Parkinson’s; ageing; neurodegeneration; systems biology

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an established model organism for studying obesity and diabetes including diabetic microvascular complications. We aimed to determine whether physical activity is an appropriate tool to examine training effects in zebrafish and to analyse metabolic and transcriptional processes in trained zebrafish. A 2- and 8-week experimental training phase protocol with adult zebrafish in a swim tunnel system was established. We examined zebrafish basic characteristics before and after training such as body weight, body length and maximum speed and considered overfeeding as an additional parameter in the 8-weeks training protocol. Ultimately, the effects of training and overfeeding on blood glucose, muscle core metabolism and liver gene expression using RNA-Seq were investigated. Zebrafish maximum speed was correlated with body length and was significantly increased after 2 weeks of training. Maximum swim speed further increased after 8 weeks of training in both the normal-fed and the overfed groups, but training was found not to be sufficient in preventing weight gain in overfed fish. Metabolome and transcriptome profiling in trained fish exhibited increased blood glucose levels in the short-term and upregulated energy supply pathways as well as response to oxidative stress in the long-term. In conclusion, swim training is a valuable tool to study the effects of physical activity in zebrafish, which is accompanied by metabolic and transcriptional adaptations.	2021-10-07	2024-03-06 20:15:54	2024-03-06T20:15:54Z		1581		10	10		Antioxidants (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34679716 PMCID: PMC8533608					blood glucose; danio rerio; diabetes; metabolomics; physical activity; transcriptional profile																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

Dietary exposure to the food preservative tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) impairs zebrafish (Danio rerio) survival, growth, organ development, and gene expression in Nrf2a-dependent and independent ways	Food and Chemical Toxicology: An International Journal Published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association		1873-6351	10.1016/j.fct.2023.113788		Tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a preservative used to prevent oxidative deterioration of oil, fat, and meat products, has been linked to both chemoprotective and adverse effects. This study investigates the impact of dietary tBHQ consumption on survival, growth parameters, organ development, and gene expression in zebrafish (Danio rerio). As tBHQ activates the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2a), a zebrafish line with a mutation in the DNA-binding domain of Nrf2a was used to identify Nrf2a-dependent vs independent effects. Homozygous Nrf2a wildtype (wt) and mutant (m) larvae were fed a diet containing 5% tBHQ or a control diet. Survival and growth parameters were assessed at 15 days and at 5 months, and samples were collected for RNA sequencing at 5 months. Dietary exposure to tBHQ throughout the larval and juvenile periods negatively impacted growth and survival. RNA-seq analysis found differentially expressed genes related to growth and development and upregulation of several immune system-related pathways. The findings herein demonstrate that dietary tBHQ exposure may impair growth and survival in both Nrf2a dependent and independent manners.	2023-06	2024-03-06 20:19:20	2024-03-06T20:19:20Z		113788			176		Food Chem Toxicol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37075880 PMCID: PMC10213143					Animals; Antioxidant defenses; Antioxidants; Dietary Exposure; Embryonic development; Food Preservatives; Gene Expression; Hydroquinones; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nrf2; Oxidative Stress; Pancreatic islet; Redox; Tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ); Zebrafish

PRDM1 DNA-binding zinc finger domain is required for normal limb development and is disrupted in split hand/foot malformation	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.049977		Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a rare limb abnormality with clefting of the fingers and/or toes. For many individuals, the genetic etiology is unknown. Through whole-exome and targeted sequencing, we detected three novel variants in a gene encoding a transcription factor, PRDM1, that arose de novo in families with SHFM or segregated with the phenotype. PRDM1 is required for limb development; however, its role is not well understood and it is unclear how the PRDM1 variants affect protein function. Using transient and stable overexpression rescue experiments in zebrafish, we show that the variants disrupt the proline/serine-rich and DNA-binding zinc finger domains, resulting in a dominant-negative effect. Through gene expression assays, RNA sequencing, and CUT&RUN in isolated pectoral fin cells, we demonstrate that Prdm1a directly binds to and regulates genes required for fin induction, outgrowth and anterior/posterior patterning, such as fgfr1a, dlx5a, dlx6a and smo. Taken together, these results improve our understanding of the role of PRDM1 in the limb gene regulatory network and identified novel PRDM1 variants that link to SHFM in humans.	2023-04-01	2024-03-06 20:19:20	2024-03-06T20:19:20Z		dmm049977		4	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37083955 PMCID: PMC10151829					Animals; DNA; Limb; Limb Deformities, Congenital; PRDM1; Pectoral fin; Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1; Split hand/foot malformation; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zinc Fingers

Here, we found that both brg1 mRNA and protein were induced in cardiac endothelial cells after ventricular resection and endothelium-specific overexpression of dominant-negative Xenopus Brg1 (dn-xbrg1) inhibited myocardial proliferation and heart regeneration and increased cardiac fibrosis. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis revealed that endothelium-specific overexpression of dn-xbrg1 changed the levels of H3K4me3 modifications in the promoter regions of the zebrafish genome and induced abnormal activation of Notch family genes upon injury. Mechanistically, Brg1 interacted with lysine demethylase 7aa (Kdm7aa) to fine-tune the level of H3K4me3 within the promoter regions of Notch family genes and thus regulated notch gene transcription. Together, this work demonstrates that the Brg1-Kdm7aa-Notch axis in cardiac endothelial cells, including the endocardium, regulates myocardial proliferation and regeneration via modulating the H3K4me3 of the notch promoters in zebrafish.	2023-04-07	2024-03-06 20:19:20	2024-03-06T20:19:20Z		21		1	8		NPJ Regen Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37029137 PMCID: PMC10082087

Pigment cell progenitor heterogeneity and reiteration of developmental signaling underlie melanocyte regeneration in zebrafish	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.78942		Tissue-resident stem and progenitor cells are present in many adult organs, where they are important for organ homeostasis and repair in response to injury. However, the signals that activate these cells and the mechanisms governing how these cells renew or differentiate are highly context-dependent and incompletely understood, particularly in non-hematopoietic tissues. In the skin, melanocyte stem and progenitor cells are responsible for replenishing mature pigmented melanocytes. In mammals, these cells reside in the hair follicle bulge and bulb niches where they are activated during homeostatic hair follicle turnover and following melanocyte destruction, as occurs in vitiligo and other skin hypopigmentation disorders. Recently, we identified melanocyte progenitors in adult zebrafish skin. To elucidate mechanisms governing melanocyte progenitor renewal and differentiation we analyzed individual transcriptomes from thousands of melanocyte lineage cells during the regeneration process. We identified transcriptional signatures for progenitors, deciphered transcriptional changes and intermediate cell states during regeneration, and analyzed cell-cell signaling changes to discover mechanisms governing melanocyte regeneration. We identified KIT signaling via the RAS/MAPK pathway as a regulator of melanocyte progenitor direct differentiation and asymmetric division. Our findings show how activation of different subpopulations of mitfa-positive cells underlies cellular transitions required to properly reconstitute the melanocyte pigmentary system following injury.	2023-04-06	2024-03-06 20:19:20	2024-03-06T20:19:20Z		e78942			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37021774 PMCID: PMC10139689					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Danio rerio; Hair Follicle; Mammals; Melanocytes; Signal Transduction; Skin; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; developmental biology; melanocyte stem cells; melanocytes; regeneration; regenerative medicine; stem cell biology; stem cells; zebrafish

Here, using a combination of single-cell multi-omics, lineage tracing and functional assays, we show that embryonic HSPCs originate from heterogeneous hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) during zebrafish embryogenesis. Integrated single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis demonstrates transcriptional heterogeneity and regulatory programs that prime lymphoid/myeloid fates at the HEC level. Importantly, spi2+ HECs give rise to lymphoid/myeloid-primed HSPCs (L/M-HSPCs) and display a stress-responsive function under acute inflammation. Moreover, we uncover that Spi2 is required for the formation of L/M-HSPCs through tightly controlling the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition program. Finally, single-cell transcriptional comparison of zebrafish and human HECs and human induced pluripotent stem cell-based hematopoietic differentiation results support the evolutionary conservation of L/M-HECs and a conserved role of SPI1 (spi2 homolog in mammals) in humans. These results unveil the lineage origin, biological function and molecular determinant of HSPC heterogeneity and lay the foundation for new strategies for induction of transplantable lineage-primed HSPCs in vitro.	2023-06	2024-03-06 20:19:19	2024-03-06T20:19:19Z		448-463		6	33		Cell Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37016019 PMCID: PMC10235423					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Mammals; Zebrafish

Short-Term Effects of Human versus Bovine Sialylated Milk Oligosaccharide Microinjection on Zebrafish Larvae Survival, Locomotor Behavior and Gene Expression	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms24065456		Milk oligosaccharides are a complex class of carbohydrates that act as bioactive factors in numerous defensive and physiological functions, including brain development. Early nutrition can modulate nervous system development and can lead to epigenetic imprinting. We attempted to increase the sialylated oligosaccharide content of zebrafish yolk reserves, with the aim of evaluating any short-term effects of the treatment on mortality, locomotor behavior, and gene expression. Wild-type embryos were microinjected with saline solution or solutions containing sialylated milk oligosaccharides extracted from human and bovine milk. The results suggest that burst activity and larval survival rates were unaffected by the treatments. Locomotion parameters were found to be similar during the light phase between control and treated larvae; in the dark, however, milk oligosaccharide-treated larvae showed increased test plate exploration. Thigmotaxis results did not reveal significant differences in either the light or the dark conditions. The RNA-seq analysis indicated that both treatments exert an antioxidant effect in developing fish. Moreover, sialylated human milk oligosaccharides seemed to increase the expression of genes related to cell cycle control and chromosomal replication, while bovine-derived oligosaccharides caused an increase in the expression of genes involved in synaptogenesis and neuronal signaling. These data shed some light on this poorly explored research field, showing that both human and bovine oligosaccharides support brain proliferation and maturation.	2023-03-13	2024-03-06 20:19:19	2024-03-06T20:19:19Z		5456		6	24		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36982531 PMCID: PMC10051688					Animals; Gene Expression; Humans; Larva; Microinjections; Milk; Milk, Human; Oligosaccharides; RNA-seq; Zebrafish; bovine milk; brain development; human milk; locomotor behavior; milk oligosaccharides; nutraceuticals; sialylated oligosaccharides; thigmotaxis; zebrafish

Maternal exposure to certain triazole antifungal medication causes congenital malformations, including skeletal malformations. We hypothesized that triazoles used as pesticides in agriculture also pose a risk of causing skeletal malformations in developing embryos. In this study, teratogenic effects of three commonly used triazoles, cyproconazole, paclobutrazol, and triadimenol, were investigated in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Exposure to the triazole fungicides caused bone and cartilage malformations in developing zebrafish larvae. Data from whole-embryo transcriptomics with cyproconazole suggested that exposure to this compound induces adipogenesis while repressing skeletal development. Confirming this finding, the expression of selected bone and cartilage marker genes were significantly downregulated with triazoles exposure as determined by quantitative PCR. The expression of selected adipogenic genes was upregulated by the triazoles. Furthermore, exposure to each of the three triazoles induced adipogenesis and lipid droplet formation in vitro in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells. In vivo in zebrafish larvae, cyproconazole exposure caused lipid accumulation. These results suggest that exposure to triazoles promotes adipogenesis at the expense of skeletal development, and thus they expand the chemical group of bona fide bone to fat switchers.	2023-05-31	2024-03-06 20:19:19	2024-03-06T20:19:19Z		119-130		2	193		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36951524 PMCID: PMC10230286					Adipogenesis; Animals; Antifungal Agents; Female; Fungicides, Industrial; Humans; Triazoles; Zebrafish; adipocytes; adverse effects; embryo malformations; skeleton

Moreover, sporadic PD patients also have a substantial reduction of GCase activity. Genetic variants of SMPD1 are also overrepresented in PD cohorts, whereas a reduction of its encoded enzyme (acid sphingomyelinase or ASM) activity is linked to an earlier age of PD onset. Despite both converging on the ceramide pathway, how the combined deficiencies of both enzymes might interact to modulate PD has yet to be explored. Therefore, we created a double-knockout (DKO) zebrafish line for both gba1 (or gba) and smpd1 to test for an interaction in vivo, hypothesising an exacerbation of phenotypes in the DKO line compared to those for single mutants. Unexpectedly, DKO zebrafish maintained conventional swimming behaviour and had normalised neuronal gene expression signatures compared to those of single mutants. We further identified rescue of mitochondrial Complexes I and IV in DKO zebrafish. Despite having an unexpected rescue effect, our results confirm ASM as a modifier of GBA1 deficiency in vivo. Our study highlights the need for validating how genetic variants and enzymatic deficiencies may interact in vivo.	2023-06-01	2024-03-06 20:19:18	2024-03-06T20:19:18Z		dmm049954		6	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36951087 PMCID: PMC10184672					Acid sphingomyelinase; Animals; Gene-gene interaction; Glucocerebrosidase 1; Glucosylceramidase; Mutation; Niemann-Pick Disease, Type A; Parkinson Disease; Parkinson's disease; Phenotype; Zebrafish; alpha-Synuclein

However, the adverse effects of Tl, especially cardiotoxicity, on aquatic biota remain unclear. In this study, zebrafish model was used to elucidate the effects and mechanisms of Tl(I) cardiotoxicity in developing embryos. Exposure of embryonic zebrafish to low-dose Tl(I) (25-100 μg/L) decreased heart rate and blood flow activity, and subsequently impaired swim bladder inflation and locomotive behavior of larvae. Following high-level Tl(I) administration (200-800 μg/L), embryonic zebrafish exhibited pericardial edema, incorrect heart looping, and thinner myocardial layer. Based on RNA-sequencing, Tl(I) altered pathways responsible for protein folding and transmembrane transport, as well as negative regulation of heart rate and cardiac jelly development. The gene expression of nppa, nppb, ucp1, and ucp3, biomarkers of cardiac damage, were significantly upregulated by Tl(I). Our findings demonstrate that Tl(I) at environmentally relevant concentrations interfered with cardiac development with respect to anatomy, function, and transcriptomic alterations. The cardiotoxic mechanisms of Tl(I) provide valuable information in the assessment of Tl-related ecological risk in freshwater environment.	2023-06-20	2024-03-06 20:19:18	2024-03-06T20:19:18Z		162901			878		Sci Total Environ	Thallium exposure interfered with heart development in embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio)							eng					PubMed		PMID: 36948317					Animals; Cardiotoxicity; Developmental toxicity; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Embryonic zebrafish model; Genotype; Phenotype; Thallium; Transcriptomic profiling; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
QNLEJKP4	journalArticle	2023	Baer, Lachlan; Barthelson, Karissa; Postlethwait, John; Adelson, David; Pederson, Stephen; Lardelli, Michael	Differential allelic representation (DAR) identifies candidate eQTLs and improves transcriptome analysis	bioRxiv: The Preprint Server for Biology			10.1101/2023.03.02.530865		In comparisons between mutant and wild-type genotypes, transcriptome analysis can reveal the direct impacts of a mutation, together with the homeostatic responses of the biological system. Recent studies have highlighted that, when homozygous mutations are studied in non-isogenic backgrounds, genes from the same chromosome as a mutation often appear over-represented among differentially expressed (DE) genes. One hypothesis suggests that DE genes chromosomally linked to a mutation may not reflect true biological responses to the mutation but, instead, result from differences in representation of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between sample groups selected on the basis of mutant or wild-type genotype. This is problematic when inclusion of spurious DE genes in a functional enrichment study results in incorrect inferences of mutation effect. Here we show that chromosomally co-located differentially expressed genes (CC-DEGs) can also be observed in analyses of dominant mutations in heterozygotes. We define a method and a metric to quantify, in RNA-sequencing data, localised differential allelic representation (DAR) between groups of samples subject to differential expression analysis. We show how the DAR metric can predict regions prone to eQTL-driven differential expression, and how it can improve functional enrichment analyses through gene exclusion or weighting of gene-level rankings. Advantageously, this improved ability to identify probable eQTLs also reveals examples of CC-DEGs that are likely to be functionally related to a mutant phenotype. This supports a long-standing prediction that selection for advantageous linkage disequilibrium influences chromosome evolution. By comparing the genomes of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), a teleost with a conserved ancestral karyotype, we find possible examples of chromosomal aggregation of CC-DEGs during evolution of the zebrafish lineage. The DAR metric provides a solid foundation for addressing the eQTL issue in new and existing datasets because it relies solely on RNA-sequencing data.	2023-03-21	2024-03-06 20:19:18	2024-03-06T20:19:18Z		2023.03.02.530865					bioRxiv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36945478 PMCID: PMC10028786

High-throughput functional analysis of autism genes in zebrafish identifies convergence in dopaminergic and neuroimmune pathways	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112243		Advancing from gene discovery in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to the identification of biologically relevant mechanisms remains a central challenge. Here, we perform parallel in vivo functional analysis of 10 ASD genes at the behavioral, structural, and circuit levels in zebrafish mutants, revealing both unique and overlapping effects of gene loss of function. Whole-brain mapping identifies the forebrain and cerebellum as the most significant contributors to brain size differences, while regions involved in sensory-motor control, particularly dopaminergic regions, are associated with altered baseline brain activity. Finally, we show a global increase in microglia resulting from ASD gene loss of function in select mutants, implicating neuroimmune dysfunction as a key pathway relevant to ASD biology.	2023-03-28	2024-03-06 20:19:17	2024-03-06T20:19:17Z		112243		3	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36933215 PMCID: PMC10277173					Animals; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; CP: Neuroscience; Zebrafish; autism spectrum disorder; dopaminergic neurons; genetics; microglia; neurodevelopment; zebrafish

Single-cell analysis of lymphatic endothelial cell fate specification and differentiation during zebrafish development	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.15252/embj.2022112590		During development, the lymphatic vasculature forms as a second network derived chiefly from blood vessels. The transdifferentiation of embryonic venous endothelial cells (VECs) into lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is a key step in this process. Specification, differentiation and maintenance of LEC fate are all driven by the transcription factor Prox1, yet the downstream mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We here present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish, revealing new markers and hallmarks of LEC differentiation over four developmental stages. We further profile single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes in zygotic prox1a mutants that are undergoing a LEC-VEC fate shift. Using maternal and zygotic prox1a/prox1b mutants, we determine the earliest transcriptomic changes directed by Prox1 during LEC specification.

Albert	Deficiency in the cell-adhesion molecule dscaml1 impairs hypothalamic CRH neuron development and perturbs normal neuroendocrine stress axis function	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2023.1113675		The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus are critical regulators of the neuroendocrine stress response pathway, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. As developmental vulnerabilities of CRH neurons contribute to stress-associated neurological and behavioral dysfunctions, it is critical to identify the mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal CRH neuron development. Using zebrafish, we identified Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like-1 (dscaml1) as an integral mediator of CRH neuron development and necessary for establishing normal stress axis function. In dscaml1 mutant animals, hypothalamic CRH neurons had higher crhb (the CRH homolog in zebrafish) expression, increased cell number, and reduced cell death compared to wild-type controls. Physiologically, dscaml1 mutant animals had higher baseline stress hormone (cortisol) levels and attenuated responses to acute stressors. Together, these findings identify dscaml1 as an essential factor for stress axis development and suggest that HPA axis dysregulation may contribute to the etiology of human DSCAML1-linked neuropsychiatric disorders.	2023	2024-03-06 20:19:17	2024-03-06T20:19:17Z		1113675			11		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36875755 PMCID: PMC9978177					CRH neuron; HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis; development; hypothalamus; zebrafish

Due to the limitation of conventional approaches in identifying broader spectrum of immune cells and molecules from various vertebrates, it remains unclear how immune molecules evolve among vertebrates. OBJECTIVES: Here, we utilized carry out comparative transcriptome analysis in various immune cells across seven vertebrate species. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). RESULTS: We uncovered both conserved and species-specific profiling of gene expression in innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophages exhibited highly-diversified genes and developed sophisticated molecular signaling networks along with evolution, indicating effective and versatile functions in higher species. In contrast, B cells conservatively evolved with less differentially-expressed genes in analyzed species. Interestingly, T cells represented a dominant immune cell populations in all species and unique T cell populations were identified in zebrafish and pig. We also revealed compensatory TCR cascade components utilized by different species. Inter-species comparison of core gene programs demonstrated mouse species has the highest similarity in immune transcriptomes to human. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our comparative study reveals gene transcription characteristics across multiple vertebrate species during the evolution of immune system, providing insights for species-specific immunity as well as the translation of animal studies to human physiology and disease.	2024-01	2024-03-06 20:19:16	2024-03-06T20:19:16Z		73-87			55		J Adv Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36871615 PMCID: PMC10770119					Across species; Adaptive Immunity; Adaptive immunity; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Innate immunity; Macrophages; Mice; ScRNA-Seq; Swine; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Studies Reveal That Toll-like Receptor 2 Has a Role in Glucose-Related Metabolism in Unchallenged Zebrafish Larvae (Danio rerio)	Biology		2079-7737	10.3390/biology12020323		Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in the regulation of various metabolism pathways, in addition to their function in innate immunity. Here, we investigate the metabolic function of TLR2 in a larval zebrafish system. We studied larvae from a tlr2 mutant and the wild type sibling controls in an unchallenged normal developmental condition using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses methods. RNAseq was used to evaluate transcriptomic differences between the tlr2 mutant and wild-type control zebrafish larvae and found a signature set of 149 genes to be significantly altered in gene expression. The expression level of several genes was confirmed by qPCR analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed differential enrichment of genes between the two genotypes related to valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics, we found that glucose and various metabolites related with glucose metabolism were present at higher levels in the tlr2 mutant. Furthermore, we confirmed that the glucose level is higher in tlr2 mutants by using a fluorometric assay. Therefore, we have shown that TLR2, in addition to its function in immunity, has a function in controlling metabolism during vertebrate development. The functions are associated with transcriptional regulation of various enzymes involved in glucose metabolism that could explain the different levels of glucose, lactate, succinate, and malate in larvae of a tlr2 mutant.	2023-02-16	2024-03-06 20:19:16	2024-03-06T20:19:16Z		323		2	12		Biology (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36829598 PMCID: PMC9952914					glucose metabolism; glycolysis; metabolomics; tlr2; transcriptomics; zebrafish

As a common substitute of BPA to manufacture products, Bisphenol C (BPC) is frequently detected in human samples like infants and toddlers' urine, indicating infants and young children are at risk of BPC exposure. However, the understanding of effects of BPC exposure on early development is limited. Herein, we evaluated the early developmental toxicity of BPC and studied the underlying mechanism in a zebrafish model. We found BPC exposure leading to liver and intestinal developmental defects in zebrafish, which occurred via disruption of GPER-AKT-mTOR-RPS6 pathway. Specifically, BPC downregulated phosphorylated and total levels of mTOR, which synergistically reduced the phosphorylation of RPS6, suppressing the translation of genes essential for cell proliferation in liver and intestine such as yap1 and tcf4. Collectively, our results not only observed clear toxicity of BPC during liver and intestinal development but also demonstrated the underlying mechanism of BPC-mediated defects via disrupting the GPER-AKT-mTOR-RPS6 pathway.	2023-05	2024-03-06 20:19:16	2024-03-06T20:19:16Z		138195			322		Chemosphere								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36822516					Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Bisphenol C; Cell proliferation; Developmental toxicity; Liver; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zebrafish; mTOR; p-RPS6

During development and neonatal stages, cardiomyocytes can successfully divide under injury conditions; however, as these cells mature their ability to proliferate is lost. Therefore, understanding the regulatory programs that can induce post-mitotic cardiomyocytes into a proliferative state is essential to enhance cardiac regeneration. Here, we report that the forkhead transcription factor Foxm1 is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury through transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes. Transcriptomic analysis of injured zebrafish hearts revealed that foxm1 expression is increased in border zone cardiomyocytes. Decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes in foxm1 mutant hearts was observed, suggesting it is required for cell cycle checkpoints. Subsequent analysis of a candidate Foxm1 target gene, cenpf, revealed that this microtubule and kinetochore binding protein is also required for cardiac regeneration. Moreover, cenpf mutants show increased cardiomyocyte binucleation. Thus, foxm1 and cenpf are required for cardiomyocytes to complete mitosis during zebrafish cardiac regeneration.	2023-03-15	2024-03-06 20:19:16	2024-03-06T20:19:16Z		dev201163		6	150		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36846912 PMCID: PMC10108034					Animals; Binucleation; Cardiomyocyte proliferation; Cell Proliferation; Cenpf; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Foxm1; Heart; Heart Injuries; Heart regeneration; Mammals; Myocytes, Cardiac; Zebrafish

We generated peroxin 5 homozygous mutant zebrafish (pex5-/-) to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of peroxisome dysfunction. pex5-/- display hallmarks of ZSD in humans and die within one month after birth. Fasting rapidly depletes lipids and glycogen in pex5-/- livers and expedites their mortality. Mechanistically, deregulated mitochondria and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling act together to induce metabolic alterations that deplete hepatic nutrients and accumulate damaged mitochondria. Accordingly, chemical interventions blocking either the mitochondrial function or mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) or a combination of both improve the metabolic imbalance shown in the fasted pex5-/- livers and extend the survival of animals. In addition, the suppression of oxidative stress by N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) treatment rescued the apoptotic cell death and early mortality observed in pex5-/-. Furthermore, an autophagy activator effectively ameliorated the early mortality of fasted pex5-/-. These results suggest that fasting may be detrimental to patients with peroxisome dysfunction, and that modulating the mitochondria, mTORC1, autophagy activities, or oxidative stress may provide a therapeutic option to alleviate the symptoms of peroxisomal diseases associated with metabolic dysfunction.	2023-02-23	2024-03-06 20:19:15	2024-03-06T20:19:15Z		69		3	80		Cell Mol Life Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36821008 PMCID: PMC9950184					Animals; Autophagy; Fasting; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Mitochondria; Peroxisome-Targeting Signal 1 Receptor; Peroxisomes; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zebrafish; Zellweger spectrum disorder; mTOR; pex5

Alternative polyadenylation alters protein dosage by switching between intronic and 3'UTR sites	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.ade4814		Alternative polyadenylation (APA) creates distinct transcripts from the same gene by cleaving the pre-mRNA at poly(A) sites that can lie within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), introns, or exons. Most studies focus on APA within the 3'UTR; however, here, we show that CPSF6 insufficiency alters protein levels and causes a developmental syndrome by deregulating APA throughout the transcript. In neonatal humans and zebrafish larvae, CPSF6 insufficiency shifts poly(A) site usage between the 3'UTR and internal sites in a pathway-specific manner. Genes associated with neuronal function undergo mostly intronic APA, reducing their expression, while genes associated with heart and skeletal function mostly undergo 3'UTR APA and are up-regulated. This suggests that, under healthy conditions, cells toggle between internal and 3'UTR APA to modulate protein expression.	2023-02-17	2024-03-06 20:19:15	2024-03-06T20:19:15Z		eade4814		7	9		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36800428 PMCID: PMC9937581					3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Exons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Introns; Polyadenylation; Zebrafish

While many genes regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for ∼23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l/cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, and computational biology.	2022-01-12	2024-03-06 20:19:14	2024-03-06T20:19:14Z		100083		1	2		Cell Genom								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36777038 PMCID: PMC9903790					Hi-C; chromatin; cis regulatory element; enhancer; npas4l; promoter; single-cell ATAC-seq; zebrafish

SLAMseq resolves the kinetics of maternal and zygotic gene expression during early zebrafish embryogenesis	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112070		The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a key developmental process in metazoan embryos that involves the activation of zygotic transcription (ZGA) and degradation of maternal transcripts. We employed metabolic mRNA sequencing (SLAMseq) to deconvolute the compound embryonic transcriptome in zebrafish. While mitochondrial zygotic transcripts prevail prior to MZT, we uncover the spurious transcription of hundreds of short and intron-poor genes as early as the 2-cell stage. Upon ZGA, most zygotic transcripts originate from thousands of maternal-zygotic (MZ) genes that are transcribed at rates comparable to those of hundreds of purely zygotic genes and replenish maternal mRNAs at distinct timescales. Rapid replacement of MZ transcripts involves transcript decay features unrelated to major maternal degradation pathways and promotes de novo synthesis of the core gene expression machinery by increasing poly(A)-tail length and translation efficiency. SLAMseq hence provides insights into the timescales, molecular features, and regulation of MZT during zebrafish embryogenesis.	2023-02-28	2024-03-06 20:19:14	2024-03-06T20:19:14Z		112070		2	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36757845					Animals; CP: Developmental biology; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zygote; embryogenesis; maternal-to-zygotic transition; metabolic RNA sequencing; zebrafish; zygotic genome activation

Here we use gene-regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multi-omics data to perform in silico transcription factor perturbations, simulating the consequent changes in cell identity using only unperturbed wild-type data. We apply this machine-learning-based approach, CellOracle, to well-established paradigms-mouse and human haematopoiesis, and zebrafish embryogenesis-and we correctly model reported changes in phenotype that occur as a result of transcription factor perturbation. Through systematic in silico transcription factor perturbation in the developing zebrafish, we simulate and experimentally validate a previously unreported phenotype that results from the loss of noto, an established notochord regulator. Furthermore, we identify an axial mesoderm regulator, lhx1a. Together, these results show that CellOracle can be used to analyse the regulation of cell identity by transcription factors, and can provide mechanistic insights into development and differentiation.	2023-02	2024-03-06 20:19:14	2024-03-06T20:19:14Z		742-751		7949	614		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36755098 PMCID: PMC9946838					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Computer Simulation; Embryonic Development; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Mesoderm; Mice; Phenotype; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

Transcriptional regulation is critical to generate diversity within these major cell classes. Here, we aim to provide the resources and techniques required to identify transcription factors necessary to generate and maintain diversity in photoreceptor subtypes, which are critical for vision. First, we generate a key resource: a high-quality and deep transcriptomic profile of each photoreceptor subtype in adult zebrafish. We make this resource openly accessible, easy to explore, and have integrated it with other currently available photoreceptor transcriptomic datasets. Second, using our transcriptomic profiles, we derive an in-depth map of expression of transcription factors in photoreceptors. Third, we use efficient CRISPR-Cas9 based mutagenesis to screen for null phenotypes in F0 larvae (F0 screening) as a fast, efficient, and versatile technique to assess the involvement of candidate transcription factors in the generation of photoreceptor subtypes. We first show that known phenotypes can be easily replicated using this method: loss of S cones in foxq2 mutants and loss of rods in nr2e3 mutants. We then identify novel functions for the transcription factor Tbx2, demonstrating that it plays distinct roles in controlling the generation of all photoreceptor subtypes within the retina. Our study provides a roadmap to discover additional factors involved in this process. Additionally, we explore four transcription factors of unknown function (Skor1a, Sall1a, Lrrfip1a, and Xbp1), and find no evidence for their involvement in the generation of photoreceptor subtypes. This dataset and screening method will be a valuable way to explore the genes involved in many other essential aspects of photoreceptor biology.	2023-02-06	2024-03-06 20:19:14	2024-03-06T20:19:14Z		e81579			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36745553 PMCID: PMC9901936					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Retina; Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; cone subtypes; developmental biology; neuroscience; photoreceptor fate; retina; transcription factor; transcriptomics; zebrafish

Expression of the Z Variant of α1-Antitrypsin Suppresses Hepatic Cholesterol Biosynthesis in Transgenic Zebrafish	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms24032475		Individuals homozygous for the Pi*Z allele of SERPINA1 (ZAAT) are susceptible to lung disease due to insufficient α1-antitrypsin secretion into the circulation and may develop liver disease due to compromised protein folding that leads to inclusion body formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. Transgenic zebrafish expressing human ZAAT show no signs of hepatic accumulation despite displaying serum insufficiency, suggesting the defect in ZAAT secretion occurs independently of its tendency to form inclusion bodies. In this study, proteomic, transcriptomic, and biochemical analysis provided evidence of suppressed Srebp2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of ZAAT-expressing zebrafish. To investigate the basis for this perturbation, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to manipulate ER protein quality control factors. Mutation of erlec1 resulted in a further suppression in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, confirming a role for this ER lectin in targeting misfolded ZAAT for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Mutation of the two ER mannosidase homologs enhanced ZAAT secretion without inducing hepatic accumulation. These insights into hepatic ZAAT processing suggest potential therapeutic targets to improve secretion and alleviate serum insufficiency in this form of the α1-antitrypsin disease.	2023-01-27	2024-03-06 20:19:14	2024-03-06T20:19:14Z		2475		3	24		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36768797 PMCID: PMC9917206					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Line; Cholesterol; ERAD; Humans; Liver; Proteomics; SERPINA1; Zebrafish; alpha 1-Antitrypsin; liver; zebrafish; α-1-antitrypsin

Specificity of the innate immune responses to different classes of non-tuberculous mycobacteria	Frontiers in Immunology		1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2022.1075473		Mycobacterium avium is the most common nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) species causing infectious disease. Here, we characterized a M. avium infection model in zebrafish larvae, and compared it to M. marinum infection, a model of tuberculosis. M. avium bacteria are efficiently phagocytosed and frequently induce granuloma-like structures in zebrafish larvae. Although macrophages can respond to both mycobacterial infections, their migration speed is faster in infections caused by M. marinum. Tlr2 is conservatively involved in most aspects of the defense against both mycobacterial infections. However, Tlr2 has a function in the migration speed of macrophages and neutrophils to infection sites with M. marinum that is not observed with M. avium. Using RNAseq analysis, we found a distinct transcriptome response in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction for M. avium and M. marinum infection. In addition, we found differences in gene expression in metabolic pathways, phagosome formation, matrix remodeling, and apoptosis in response to these mycobacterial infections. In conclusion, we characterized a new M. avium infection model in zebrafish that can be further used in studying pathological mechanisms for NTM-caused diseases.	2022	2024-03-06 20:19:13	2024-03-06T20:19:13Z		1075473			13		Front Immunol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36741407 PMCID: PMC9890051					Animals; Immunity, Innate; Larva; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Nontuberculous Mycobacteria; Tlr2; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Zebrafish; leukocyte migration; metabolism; nontuberculous mycobacterium; zebrafish

However, the identity of Cap2-containing mRNAs and the function of Cap2 are unclear. Here we describe CLAM-Cap-seq, a method for transcriptome-wide mapping and quantification of Cap2. We find that unlike other epitranscriptomic modifications, Cap2 can occur on all mRNAs. Cap2 is formed through a slow continuous conversion of mRNAs from Cap1 to Cap2 as mRNAs age in the cytosol. As a result, Cap2 is enriched on long-lived mRNAs. Large increases in the abundance of Cap1 leads to activation of RIG-I, especially in conditions in which expression of RIG-I is increased. The methylation of Cap1 to Cap2 markedly reduces the ability of RNAs to bind to and activate RIG-I. The slow methylation rate of Cap2 allows Cap2 to accumulate on host mRNAs, yet ensures that low levels of Cap2 occur on newly expressed viral RNAs. Overall, these results reveal an immunostimulatory role for Cap1, and that Cap2 functions to reduce activation of the innate immune response.	2023-02	2024-03-06 20:19:13	2024-03-06T20:19:13Z		358-366		7947	614		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36725932 PMCID: PMC9891201					Animals; Cellular Senescence; Cytosol; DEAD Box Protein 58; Epigenome; Gene Expression Profiling; Immunity, Innate; Mammals; Methylation; Nucleotides; RNA Cap Analogs; RNA Caps; RNA, Messenger; Receptors, Immunologic; Time Factors; Transcriptome

Here, by combining live-imaging-based lineage-tracing and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish embryos, we identify an unexpected origin for part of the vascular HSPC niche. We find that islet1 (isl1)-expressing cells are the progenitors of the venous ECs that constitute the majority of the HSPC niche. These isl1-expressing cells surprisingly originate from the endoderm and differentiate into ECs in a process dependent on Bmp-Smad signaling and subsequently requiring npas4l (cloche) function. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses show that isl1-derived ECs express a set of genes that reflect their distinct origin. This study demonstrates that endothelial specialization in the HSPC niche is determined at least in part by the origin of the ECs.	2023-02-06	2024-03-06 20:19:13	2024-03-06T20:19:13Z		224-238.e7		3	58		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36693371					Animals; Endoderm; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Zebrafish; endothelial specialization; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; imaging-based lineage tracing; vascular niche

Zebrafish her3 knockout impacts developmental and cancer-related gene signatures	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2023.01.003		HES3 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates neural stem cell renewal during development. HES3 overexpression is predictive of reduced overall survival in patients with fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric cancer that resembles immature and undifferentiated skeletal muscle. However, the mechanisms of HES3 cooperation in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma are unclear and are likely related to her3/HES3's role in neurogenesis. To investigate HES3's function during development, we generated a zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 null mutation of her3, the zebrafish ortholog of HES3. Loss of her3 is not embryonic lethal and adults exhibit expected Mendelian ratios. Embryonic her3 zebrafish mutants exhibit dysregulated neurog1 expression, a her3 target gene, and the mutant her3 fails to bind the neurog1 promoter sequence. Further, her3 mutants are significantly smaller than wildtype and a subset present with lens defects as adults. Transcriptomic analysis of her3 mutant embryos indicates that genes involved in organ development, such as pctp and grinab, are significantly downregulated. Further, differentially expressed genes in her3 null mutant embryos are enriched for Hox and Sox10 motifs. Several cancer-related gene pathways are impacted, including the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases. Altogether, this new model is a powerful system to study her3/HES3-mediated neural development and its misappropriation in cancer contexts.	2023-04	2024-03-06 20:19:13	2024-03-06T20:19:13Z		1-14			496		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36696714 PMCID: PMC10054701					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; CRISPR/Cas9 knockout; Functional genomics; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Her3/HES3; Nervous System; Neural development; Neurogenesis; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Transcriptomics; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Hibernation confers radio-protective effects in hibernating animals, and this has led to the investigation of synthetic torpor to mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposure. Here we describe an induced torpor model we developed using the zebrafish. We explored the effects of radiation exposure on this model with a focus on the liver. Transcriptomic and behavioural analyses were performed. Radiation exposure resulted in transcriptomic perturbations in lipid metabolism and absorption, wound healing, immune response, and fibrogenic pathways. Induced torpor reduced metabolism and increased pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, and DNA repair pathways. Coupled with radiation exposure, induced torpor led to a stress response but also revealed maintenance of DNA repair mechanisms, pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals. To further characterise our model of induced torpor, the zebrafish model was compared with hepatic transcriptomic data from hibernating grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and active controls revealing conserved responses in gene expression associated with anti-apoptotic processes, DNA damage repair, cell survival, proliferation, and antioxidant response. Similarly, the radiation group was compared with space-flown mice revealing shared changes in lipid metabolism.	2023-01-17	2024-03-06 20:19:12	2024-03-06T20:19:12Z		918		1	13		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36650199 PMCID: PMC9845366					Animals; Hibernation; Liver; Mice; Radiation Exposure; Torpor; Zebrafish

Using both larval and adult zebrafish models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which the expression of an inducible mutant kras transgene (krasG12V) drives hepatocyte-specific hyperplasia and liver enlargement, we show that reducing ahctf1 gene dosage by 50% markedly decreases liver volume, while non-hyperplastic tissues are unaffected. We demonstrate that in the context of cancer, ahctf1 heterozygosity impairs nuclear pore formation, mitotic spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation, leading to DNA damage and activation of a Tp53-dependent transcriptional programme that induces cell death and cell cycle arrest. Heterozygous expression of both ahctf1 and ranbp2 (encoding a second nucleoporin), or treatment of heterozygous ahctf1 larvae with the nucleocytoplasmic transport inhibitor, Selinexor, completely blocks krasG12V-driven hepatocyte hyperplasia. Gene expression analysis of patient samples in the liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas shows that high expression of one or more of the transcripts encoding the 10 components of the NUP107-160 subcomplex, which includes AHCTF1, is positively correlated with worse overall survival. These results provide a strong and feasible rationale for the development of novel cancer therapeutics that target ELYS function and suggest potential avenues for effective combinatorial treatments.	2023-01-17	2024-03-06 20:19:12	2024-03-06T20:19:12Z		e73407			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36648336 PMCID: PMC9897728					Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Elys; Hyperplasia; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; ahctf1; cancer biology; cell biology; hepatocellular carcinoma; kras oncogene; nucleoporin; synthetic lethality; zebrafish

VGLL2-NCOA2 leverages developmental programs for pediatric sarcomagenesis	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112013		Clinical sequencing efforts are rapidly identifying sarcoma gene fusions that lack functional validation. An example is the fusion of transcriptional coactivators, VGLL2-NCOA2, found in infantile rhabdomyosarcoma. To delineate VGLL2-NCOA2 tumorigenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities, we implement a cross-species comparative oncology approach with zebrafish, mouse allograft, and patient samples. We find that VGLL2-NCOA2 is sufficient to generate mesenchymal tumors that display features of immature skeletal muscle and recapitulate the human disease. A subset of VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish tumors transcriptionally cluster with embryonic somitogenesis and identify VGLL2-NCOA2 developmental programs, including a RAS family GTPase, ARF6. In VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish, mouse, and patient tumors, ARF6 is highly expressed. ARF6 knockout suppresses VGLL2-NCOA2 oncogenic activity in cell culture, and, more broadly, ARF6 is overexpressed in adult and pediatric sarcomas. Our data indicate that VGLL2-NCOA2 is an oncogene that leverages developmental programs for tumorigenesis and that reactivation or persistence of ARF6 could represent a therapeutic opportunity.	2023-01-31	2024-03-06 20:19:12	2024-03-06T20:19:12Z		112013		1	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36656711 PMCID: PMC10054615					Adult; Animals; CP: Cancer; Child; Gene Fusion; Humans; Mice; Muscle Proteins; Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Sarcoma; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; cross-species comparative oncology; developmental biology; functional genomics; fusion oncogene; pediatric cancer; rhabdomyosarcoma

Homozygous variants in human CRB1 result in autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), with no established genotype-phenotype correlation. The associated protein complexes have key functions in developmental pathways; however, the underlying disease mechanism remains unclear. Using the oko meduzym289/m289 (crb2a-/- ) zebrafish, we performed integrative transcriptomic (RNA-seq data) and methylomic [reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)] analysis of whole retina to identify dysregulated genes and pathways. Delayed retinal cell specification was identified in both the crb2a-/- zebrafish and CRB1 patient-derived retinal organoids, highlighting the dysfunction of cell cycle modulation and epigenetic transcriptional control. Differential DNA methylation analysis revealed novel hypermethylated pathways involving biological adhesion, Hippo, and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling. By integrating gene expression with DNA methylation using functional epigenetic modules (FEM), we identified six key modules involving cell cycle control and disturbance of TGFβ, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Hippo, and SMAD protein signal transduction pathways, revealing significant interactome hotspots relevant to crb2a function and confirming the epigenetic control of gene regulation in early retinal development, which points to a novel mechanism underlying CRB1-retinopathies. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the types of cells that form the native microenvironment for renal progenitor cells (RPCs) have not been clarified. Here, single-cell sequencing of zebrafish kidney reveals fabp10a as a principal marker of renal interstitial cells (RICs), which can be specifically labeled by GFP under the control of fabp10a promoter in the fabp10a:GFP transgenic zebrafish. During nephron regeneration, the formation of nephrons is supported by RICs that form a network to wrap the RPC aggregates. RICs that are in close contact with RPC aggregates express cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) and secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Inhibiting PGE2 production prevents nephrogenesis by reducing the proliferation of RPCs. PGE2 cooperates with Wnt4a to promote nephron maturation by regulating β-catenin stability of RPC aggregates. Overall, these findings indicate that RICs provide a necessary microenvironment for rapid nephrogenesis during nephron regeneration.	2023-01-16	2024-03-06 20:19:11	2024-03-06T20:19:11Z		e81438			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36645741 PMCID: PMC9943066					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Dinoprostone; Kidney; Nephrons; PGE2; Zebrafish; developmental biology; kidney; regeneration; renal interstitial cells; zebrafish

Here, we observed that aging is associated with a decline in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in the brains of zebrafish and mice. Moreover, drugs activating PP2A reversed age-related behavioral changes. We developed a transgenic zebrafish model to decrease PP2A activity in the brain through knockout of the ppp2r2c gene encoding a regulatory subunit of PP2A. Mutant fish exhibited the behavioral phenotype observed in old animals and premature accumulation of neural cells positive for markers of cellular senescence, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase, elevated levels cdkn2a/b, cdkn1a, senescence-associated secretory phenotype gene expression, and an increased level of DNA damage signaling. The behavioral and cell senescence phenotypes were reversed in mutant fish through treatment with the senolytic ABT263 or diverse PP2A activators as well as through cdkn1a or tp53 gene ablation. Senomorphic function of PP2A activators was demonstrated in mouse primary neural cells with downregulated Ppp2r2c. We conclude that PP2A reduction leads to neural cell senescence thereby contributing to age-related behavioral changes and that PP2A activators have senotherapeutic properties against deleterious behavioral effects of brain aging.	2023-03	2024-03-06 20:19:11	2024-03-06T20:19:11Z		e13780		3	22		Aging Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36644807 PMCID: PMC10014060					Age-related cognitive decline; Aniline Compounds; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Behavior, Animal; Biomarkers; Brain; Cellular Senescence; Cognitive Aging; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16; DNA Damage; DNA damage response neural senescence; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Mice; Models, Animal; Mutation; Neurons; PPP2R2C; Primary Cell Culture; Protein Phosphatase 2; Senotherapeutics; Sulfonamides; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; beta-Galactosidase; protein phosphatase 2A; senolytics; senotherapy

Through its G protein-coupled receptor OXER1, pure 5-oxoETE is a potent leukocyte chemoattractant. Yet, its physiological function has remained elusive owing to the unusual OXER1 conservation pattern. OXER1 is conserved from fish to primates but not in rodents, precluding genetic loss-of-function studies in mouse. To determine its physiological role, we combine transcriptomic, lipidomic, and intravital imaging assays with genetic perturbations of the OXER1 ortholog hcar1-4 in zebrafish. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection induces the synthesis of 5-oxoETE and its receptor, along with other inflammatory pathways. Hcar1-4 deletion attenuates neutrophil recruitment and decreases post-infection survival, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of hcar1-4 or human OXER1. By revealing 5-oxoETE as dominant lipid regulator of the early antimicrobial response in a non-rodent vertebrate, our work expands the current, rodent-centric view of early inflammation.	2023-01-31	2024-03-06 20:19:11	2024-03-06T20:19:11Z		111974		1	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36640321 PMCID: PMC9973399					Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Arachidonic Acid; CP: Immunology; CP: Metabolism; Humans; Mice; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

While resilient individuals recover efficiently, others are susceptible to the same stressors. However, it remains challenging to determine if resilience is established as a trait during development or acquired later in life. Using a behavioral paradigm in zebrafish larvae, we show that resilience is a stable and heritable trait, which is determined and exhibited early in life. Resilient larvae show unique stress-induced transcriptional response, and larvae with mutations in resilience-associated genes, such as neuropeptide Y and miR218, are less resilient. Transcriptome analysis shows that resilient larvae downregulate multiple factors of the innate immune complement cascade in response to stress. Perturbation of critical complement factors leads to an increase in resilience. We conclude that resilience is established as a stable trait early during development and that neuropeptides and the complement pathway play positive and negative roles in determining resilience, respectively.	2023-01-31	2024-03-06 20:19:11	2024-03-06T20:19:11Z		111973		1	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36640352					Animals; CP: Neuroscience; Complement Activation; Resilience, Psychological; Stress, Psychological; Zebrafish; individual variability; innate immunity; neurodevelopment; neuroimmune; personality traits; stress coping; zebrafish

To determine the early warning signs before osteoporosis, we used the dynamic network biomarker (DNB) approach to analyze time-series gene expression data in a zebrafish osteoporosis model, which revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (cdkn1a) is a core DNB. We found that cdkn1a negatively regulates osteogenesis, as evidenced by loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cdkn1a knockout in zebrafish significantly altered skeletal development and increased bone mineralization, whereas inducible cdkn1a expression significantly contributed to osteoclast differentiation. We also found several mechanistic clues that cdkn1a participates in osteoclast differentiation by regulating its upstream signaling cascades. To summarize, in this study, we provided new insights into the dynamic nature of osteoporosis and identified cdkn1a as an early-warning signal of osteoporosis onset.	2023-01	2024-03-06 20:19:10	2024-03-06T20:19:10Z		81-94		1	55		Exp Mol Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36599933 PMCID: PMC9898265					Animals; Biomarkers; Calcification, Physiologic; Cell Differentiation; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Zebrafish

We have previously reported the suitability of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) larval model for the study of the host-pathogen interactions in pneumococcal infection. In the present study, we characterized the zebrafish innate immune response to pneumococcus in detail through a whole-genome level transcriptome analysis and revealed a well-conserved response to this human pathogen in challenged larvae. In addition, to gain understanding of the genetic factors associated with the increased risk for severe pneumococcal infection in humans, we carried out a medium-scale forward genetic screen in zebrafish. In the screen, we identified a mutant fish line which showed compromised resistance to pneumococcus in the septic larval infection model. The transcriptome analysis of the mutant zebrafish larvae revealed deficient expression of a gene homologous for human C-reactive protein (CRP). Furthermore, knockout of one of the six zebrafish crp genes by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis predisposed zebrafish larvae to a more severe pneumococcal infection, and the phenotype was further augmented by concomitant knockdown of a gene for another Crp isoform. This suggests a conserved function of C-reactive protein in anti-pneumococcal immunity in zebrafish. Altogether, this study highlights the similarity of the host response to pneumococcus in zebrafish and humans, gives evidence of the conserved role of C-reactive protein in the defense against pneumococcus, and suggests novel host genes associated with pneumococcal infection.	2023-01	2024-03-06 20:19:10	2024-03-06T20:19:10Z		e1010586		1	19		PLoS Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36622851 PMCID: PMC9858863					Aged; Animals; C-Reactive Protein; Child; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Pneumococcal Infections; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Zebrafish

Life Sciences		1869-1889	10.1007/s11427-021-2223-4		Immunocytes, including the microglia, are crucial in the neurodegenerative process in old people. However, the understanding of regarding microglia heterogeneity and other involved immunocytes remains elusive. We analyzed 26,456 immunocytes from 12-and 26-month-old zebrafish brains at single-cell resolution. Microglia and T lymphocytes were detected in the brain at both time points. Two types of microglia were annotated, namely, ac+ microglia and xr+ microglia, which were clustered into subsets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and subsets 6, 7, 8, 9, respectively. Diversified microglia predominated the adult brains and cooperated with T cells to perform the functions of immune response and neuronal nutrition. We validated the specific microglia markers. The novel transgenic lines, Tg(lgals3bpb:eGFP) and Tg(apoc1:eGFP), were created, which faithfully labeled ac+ microglia and served as valuable labeling tools. However, the microglia population reduced while T cells of six subtypes intriguingly increased to serve as the primary immune cells in aged brains. Unlike in 12-month-old brains, T cells, together with microglia, exhibited a coordinated signature of inflammation in the 26-month-old brains. Our findings revealed the immunocytes atlas in aged zebrafish brains. It implied the involvement of microglia and T cells in the progression of neurodegeneration in aging.	2023-06	2024-03-06 20:19:10	2024-03-06T20:19:10Z		1358-1378		6	66		Sci China Life Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36607494					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Microglia; Neurons; T lymphocyte; Zebrafish; aging; inflammation; microglia; scRNA-seq; zebrafish

We identified the short stature homeobox domain 2 (shox2) transcription factor that is required for vestibular neuron development. shox2 transcripts are initially localized to the otic placode of the developing inner ear where neurosensory progenitors reside. To study shox2 function, we generated CRISPR-mediated mutant shox2 fish. Mutant embryos display behaviors associated with vestibular deficits and showed reduced number of anterior statoacoustic ganglion neurons that innervate the utricle, the vestibular organ in zebrafish. Moreover, a shox2-reporter fish showed labeling of developing statoacoustic ganglion neurons in the anterior macula of the otic vesicle. Single cell RNA-sequencing of cells from the developing otic vesicle of shox2 mutants revealed altered otic progenitor profiles, while single molecule in situ assays showed deregulated levels of transcripts in developing neurons. This study implicates a role for shox2 in development of vestibular but not auditory statoacoustic ganglion neurons.	2022-12-15	2024-03-06 20:19:10	2024-03-06T20:19:10Z		bio059599		12	11		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36594417 PMCID: PMC9838637					Animals; Ear, Inner; Inner ear; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Statoacoustic ganglion neuron; Transcription Factors; Vestibular neuron; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The relative contributions of Lsd1's demethylase and scaffolding functions during embryogenesis are not known. Here, we analyze two independent zebrafish lsd1/kdm1a mutant lines and show Lsd1 is required to repress primitive hematopoietic stem cell gene expression. Lsd1 rescue constructs containing point mutations that selectively abrogate its demethylase or scaffolding capacity demonstrate the scaffolding function of Lsd1, not its demethylase activity, is required for repression of gene expression in vivo. Lsd1's SNAG-binding domain mediates its scaffolding function and reinforces a negative feedback loop to repress the expression of SNAG-domain-containing genes during embryogenesis, including gfi1 and snai1/2. Our findings reveal a model in which the SNAG-binding and scaffolding function of Lsd1, and its associated negative feedback loop, provide transient and reversible regulation of gene expression during hematopoietic development.	2023-01-20	2024-03-06 20:19:09	2024-03-06T20:19:09Z		105737		1	26		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36594016 PMCID: PMC9803847					Cell biology; Molecular biology; Molecular interaction; Stem cells research

Here we demonstrate a general approach for measuring transcriptional response during sample preparation. In our method, transcripts made during dissociation are labeled for later identification upon sequencing. We found general as well as cell-type-specific dissociation response programs in zebrafish larvae, and we observed sample-to-sample variation in the dissociation response of mouse cardiomyocytes despite well-controlled experimental conditions. Finally, we showed that dissociation of the mouse hippocampus can lead to the artificial activation of microglia. In summary, our approach facilitates experimental optimization of dissociation procedures as well as computational removal of transcriptional perturbation response.	2023-02-10	2024-03-06 20:19:09	2024-03-06T20:19:09Z		e11147		2	19		Mol Syst Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36573354 PMCID: PMC9912023					Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Mice; Microglia; RNA; RNA labeling; SLAM-seq; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; cellular stress response; single-cell transcriptomics; tissue dissociation

Recent in vitro studies have suggested Glo2 as a regulator of glycolysis, but if Glo2 regulates glucose homeostasis and related organ specific functions in vivo has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of glo2 in zebrafish was created and analyzed. Consistent with its function in methylglyoxal detoxification, SD-Lactoylglutathione, but not methylglyoxal accumulated in glo2-/- larvae, without altering the glutathione metabolism or affecting longevity. Adult glo2-/- livers displayed a reduced hexose concentration and a reduced postprandial P70-S6 kinase activation, but upstream postprandial AKT phosphorylation remained unchanged. In contrast, glo2-/- skeletal muscle remained metabolically intact, possibly compensating for the dysfunctional liver through increased glucose uptake and glycolytic activity. glo2-/- zebrafish maintained euglycemia and showed no damage of the retinal vasculature, kidney, liver and skeletal muscle. In conclusion, the data identified Glo2 as a regulator of cellular energy metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle, but the redox state and reactive metabolite accumulation were not affected by the loss of Glo2.	2023-02	2024-03-06 20:19:09	2024-03-06T20:19:09Z		102576			59		Redox Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36535130 PMCID: PMC9792892					Animals; Glucose; Glyoxalase 2; Lactic Acid; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Methylglyoxal; P70–S6K; Pyruvaldehyde; SD-Lactoylglutathione; Thiolester Hydrolases; Zebrafish

Variable phenotypes and penetrance between and within different zebrafish ciliary transition zone mutants	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.049568		Meckel syndrome, nephronophthisis, Joubert syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome are caused by mutations in proteins that localize to the ciliary transition zone (TZ). The phenotypically distinct syndromes suggest that these TZ proteins have differing functions. However, mutations in a single TZ gene can result in multiple syndromes, suggesting that the phenotype is influenced by modifier genes. We performed a comprehensive analysis of ten zebrafish TZ mutants, including mks1, tmem216, tmem67, rpgrip1l, cc2d2a, b9d2, cep290, tctn1, nphp1 and nphp4, as well as mutants in ift88 and ift172. Our data indicate that variations in phenotypes exist between different TZ mutants, supporting different tissue-specific functions of these TZ genes. Further, we observed phenotypic variations within progeny of a single TZ mutant, reminiscent of multiple disease syndromes being associated with mutations in one gene. In some mutants, the dynamics of the phenotype became complex with transitory phenotypes that are corrected over time. We also demonstrated that multiple-guide-derived CRISPR/Cas9 F0 'crispant' embryos recapitulate zygotic null phenotypes, and rapidly identified ciliary phenotypes in 11 cilia-associated gene candidates (ankfn1, ccdc65, cfap57, fhad1, nme7, pacrg, saxo2, c1orf194, ttc26, zmynd12 and cfap52).	2022-12-01	2024-03-06 20:19:09	2024-03-06T20:19:09Z		dmm049568		12	15		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36533556 PMCID: PMC9844136					Animals; Biological Variation, Population; CRISPR; Cilia; Crispant; Joubert syndrome; Meckel syndrome; Nephronophthisis; Penetrance; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Pronephric cysts; Retinal degeneration; Scoliosis; Syndrome; Transition zone; Vesicular Transport Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Splicing factor deficits render hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells sensitive to STAT3 inhibition	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111825		Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sustain lifelong hematopoiesis. Mutations of pre-mRNA splicing machinery, especially splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1), are early lesions found in malignancies arising from HSPC dysfunction. However, why splicing factor deficits contribute to HSPC defects remains incompletely understood. Using zebrafish, we show that HSPC formation in sf3b1 homozygous mutants is dependent on STAT3 activation. Clinically, mutations in SF3B1 are heterozygous; thus, we explored if targeting STAT3 could be a vulnerability in these cells. We show that SF3B1 heterozygosity confers heightened sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in zebrafish, mouse, and human HSPCs. Cells carrying mutations in other splicing factors or treated with splicing modulators are also more sensitive to STAT3 inhibition. Mechanistically, we illustrate that STAT3 inhibition exacerbates aberrant splicing in SF3B1 mutant cells. Our findings reveal a conserved vulnerability of splicing factor mutant HSPCs that could allow for their selective targeting in hematologic malignancies.	2022-12-13	2024-03-06 20:19:08	2024-03-06T20:19:08Z		111825		11	41		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36516770 PMCID: PMC9994853					Animals; CP: Molecular biology; CP: Stem cell research; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Mice; Mutation; Phosphoproteins; RNA Splicing; RNA Splicing Factors; SF3B1; STAT3; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Zebrafish; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; myelodysplastic syndrome; splicing factor; zebrafish

Four zinc fingers constitute its DNA binding domain and two zinc fingers are present in the C-terminal protein interaction module. We describe the phenotypes of zebrafish homozygous for two distinct mutant ikzf1 alleles. The IT325 variant lacks the C-terminal two zinc fingers, whereas the fr105 variant retains only the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain. An intact ikzf1 gene is required for larval T cell development, whereas low levels of adult lymphoid development recover in the mutants. By contrast, the mutants exhibit a signature of increased myelopoiesis at larval and adult stages. Both mutations stimulate erythroid differentiation in larvae, indicating that the C-terminal zinc fingers negatively regulate the extent of red blood cell production. An unexpected differential effect of the two mutants on adult erythropoiesis suggests a direct requirement of an intact DNA binding domain for entry of progenitors into the red blood cell lineage. Collectively, our results reinforce the biological differences between larval and adult haematopoiesis, indicate a stage-specific function of ikzf1 in regulating the hierarchical bifurcations of differentiation, and assign distinct functions to the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal zinc fingers.	2022-12-10	2024-03-06 20:19:08	2024-03-06T20:19:08Z		21401		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36496511 PMCID: PMC9741631					Animals; Cell Differentiation; DNA; Erythropoiesis; Mammals; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zinc Fingers

However, it remains unclear whether composition, structure, and permeability of NPCs dynamically change during the cleavage period of vertebrate embryos and affect embryonic development. Here, we report that the comprehensive NPC maturity (CNM) controls the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) during zebrafish early embryogenesis. We show that more nucleoporin proteins are recruited to and assembled into NPCs with development, resulting in progressive increase of NPCs in size and complexity. Maternal transcription factors (TFs) transport into nuclei more efficiently with increasing CNM. Deficiency or dysfunction of Nup133 or Ahctf1/Elys impairs NPC assembly, maternal TFs nuclear transport, and ZGA onset, while nup133 overexpression promotes these processes. Therefore, CNM may act as a molecular timer for ZGA by controlling nuclear transport of maternal TFs that reach nuclear concentration thresholds at a given time to initiate ZGA.	2022-12-22	2024-03-06 20:19:08	2024-03-06T20:19:08Z		4954-4970.e20		26	185		Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36493774					Animals; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genome; Nuclear Pore; Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zygote; embryo; midblastula transition; nuclear pore complex; nuclei; transcription factor; zebrafish; zygotic genome activation

Repurposing Tamoxifen as Potential Host-Directed Therapeutic for Tuberculosis	mBio		2150-7511	10.1128/mbio.03024-22		The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) is aggravated by the continuously increasing emergence of drug resistance, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic options. The concept of host-directed therapy (HDT) as adjunctive to classical antibacterial therapy with antibiotics represents a novel and promising approach for treating TB. Here, we have focused on repurposing the clinically used anticancer drug tamoxifen, which was identified as a molecule with strong host-directed activity against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Using a primary human macrophage Mtb infection model, we demonstrate the potential of tamoxifen against drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant Mtb bacteria. The therapeutic effect of tamoxifen was confirmed in an in vivo TB model based on Mycobacterium marinum infection of zebrafish larvae. Tamoxifen had no direct antimicrobial effects at the concentrations used, confirming that tamoxifen acted as an HDT drug. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antimycobacterial effect of tamoxifen is independent of its well-known target the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway, but instead acts by modulating autophagy, in particular the lysosomal pathway. Through RNA sequencing and microscopic colocalization studies, we show that tamoxifen stimulates lysosomal activation and increases the localization of mycobacteria in lysosomes both in vitro and in vivo, while inhibition of lysosomal activity during tamoxifen treatment partly restores mycobacterial survival. Thus, our work highlights the HDT potential of tamoxifen and proposes it as a repurposed molecule for the treatment of TB. IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's most lethal infectious disease caused by a bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This pathogen evades the immune defenses of its host and grows intracellularly in immune cells, particularly inside macrophages. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies because treatment of TB patients is increasingly complicated by rising antibiotic resistance. In this study, we explored a breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, as a potential anti-TB drug. We show that tamoxifen acts as a so-called host-directed therapeutic, which means that it does not act directly on the bacteria but helps the host macrophages combat the infection more effectively. We confirmed the antimycobacterial effect of tamoxifen in a zebrafish model for TB and showed that it functions by promoting the delivery of mycobacteria to digestive organelles, the lysosomes. These results support the high potential of tamoxifen to be repurposed to fight antibiotic-resistant TB infections by host-directed therapy.	2023-02-28	2024-03-06 20:19:07	2024-03-06T20:19:07Z		e0302422		1	14		mBio								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36475748 PMCID: PMC9973281					AMR; Animals; Antitubercular Agents; Drug Repositioning; HDT; Humans; MDR; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Tamoxifen; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish; host-directed therapeutic; human macrophages; lysosomal acidification; tamoxifen; tuberculosis; zebrafish model

How these processes are spatiotemporally regulated remains unclear. Here we show that nuclear RNA-binding protein Rbm14 and maternal mRNAs co-phase separate into cytoplasmic condensates to facilitate vertebrate blastula-to-gastrula development. In zebrafish, Rbm14 condensates were highly abundant in blastomeres and markedly reduced after prominent activation of zygotic transcription. They concentrated at spindle poles by associating with centrosomal γ-tubulin puncta and displayed mainly asymmetric divisions with a global symmetry across embryonic midline in 8- and 16-cell embryos. Their formation was dose-dependently stimulated by m6 A, but repressed by m5 C modification of the maternal mRNA. Furthermore, deadenylase Parn co-phase separated with these condensates, and this was required for deadenylation of the mRNAs in early blastomeres. Depletion of Rbm14 impaired embryonic cell differentiations and full activations of the zygotic genome in both zebrafish and mouse and resulted in developmental arrest at the blastula stage. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic Rbm14 condensate formation regulates early embryogenesis by facilitating deadenylation, protection, and mitotic allocation of m6 A-modified maternal mRNAs, and by releasing the poly(A)-less transcripts upon regulated disassembly to allow their re-polyadenylation and translation or clearance.	2023-02-01	2024-03-06 20:19:07	2024-03-06T20:19:07Z		e111364		3	42		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36477743 PMCID: PMC9890236					Animals; Blastocyst; Blastula; Embryonic Development; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mice; Pregnancy; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Messenger, Stored; Zebrafish; deadenylation; embryogenesis; maternal mRNA; maternal-to-zygotic transition; phase separation

Here, we used transcriptomic analysis in an established zebrafish model of embryonic alcohol exposure (EAE) to identify the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) as a critical target of EtOH during development. Surprisingly, EAE alters 20S, 19S, and 11S proteasome gene expression and increases ubiquitylated protein load. EtOH and its metabolite acetaldehyde decrease proteasomal peptidase activity in a cell type-specific manner. Proteasome 20S subunit β 1 (psmb1hi2939Tg) and proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 6 (psmc6hi3593Tg), genetic KOs define the developmental impact of decreased proteasome function. Importantly, loss of psmb1 or psmc6 results in widespread developmental abnormalities resembling EAE phenotypes, including growth restriction, abnormal craniofacial structure, neurodevelopmental defects, and failed hepatopancreas maturation. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity potentiates the teratogenic effects of EAE on craniofacial structure, the nervous system, and the endoderm. Our studies identify the proteasome as a target of EtOH exposure and signify that UPS disruptions contribute to craniofacial, neurological, and endodermal phenotypes in FASDs.	2022-12-08	2024-03-06 20:19:07	2024-03-06T20:19:07Z		e156914		23	7		JCI Insight								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36477359 PMCID: PMC9746913					Animals; Cell stress; Development; Embryonic development; Ethanol; Molecular biology; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Ubiquitin; Zebrafish

HFPO-DA is a polymerization aid used for manufacturing fluoropolymers, whose global distribution and undetermined toxic properties are a concern regarding human and ecological health. To assess embryotoxic potential, zebrafish embryos were exposed to HFPO-DA at concentrations of 0.5-20,000 mg/L at 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-fertilization (hpf). Heart rate increased significantly in embryos exposed to 2 mg/L and 10 mg/L HFPO-DA across all time points. Spinal deformities and edema phenotypes were evident among embryos exposed to 1000-16,000 mg/L HFPO-DA at 72 hpf. A median lethal concentration (LC50) was derived as 7651 mg/L at 72 hpf. Shallow RNA sequencing analysis of 9465 transcripts identified 38 consistently differentially expressed genes at 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, and 10 mg/L HFPO-DA exposures. Notably, seven downregulated genes were associated with visual response, and seven upregulated genes were expressed in or regulated the cardiovascular system. This study identifies biological targets and molecular pathways affected during animal development by an emerging, potentially problematic, and ubiquitous industrial chemical.	2023-03	2024-03-06 20:18:48	2024-03-06T20:18:48Z		32320-32336		12	30		Environ Sci Pollut Res Int								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36462083 PMCID: PMC10017623					Animals; Danio rerio; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryology; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression; Gene expression; HFPO-DA; Humans; RNA sequencing; Toxicology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

The developmental outcomes of MeHg are well understood, but molecular understanding of toxicity is rather limited. We performed here a genome-wide transcriptional analyses of 6, 30, and 50 μg/L MeHg exposed zebrafish embryos from 4 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf) using RNA-sequencing and microarray, and conducted a systematical comparison of MeHg-induced transcriptomic responses reported in this and our previous studies. We observed MeHg significantly to disrupt expression of 1050, 1931, and 2996 genes, respectively including gene ontologies in terms of visual and sensory perception, phototransduction, ferroptosis, and GABAergic synapse. Significantly altered genes were associated with ontology categorized into metabolism, such as fatty acid, amino acid, and glutathione metabolism across all experiments. Expression of genes involved in Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways previously demonstrated to be crucial for development was changed at varying levels dependent on exposure concentrations and durations. Our findings show MeHg significantly to affect expression of genes associated with tissue and/or organs developmental processing including eye, lateral line, fins, and brain, especially in embryos exposed to 6 μg/L, which did not cause obviously toxic effects on zebrafish embryos. We obtain 21 genes being significantly altered by MeHg in a concentration and stage independent manner, and might be served as signatures for developmental toxicity and/or teratogenic effects.	2023-02	2024-03-06 20:18:48	2024-03-06T20:18:48Z		137380			313		Chemosphere								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36435318					Animals; Brain; Developmental toxicity; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene signature; Methylmercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Toxicogenetics; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Polystyrene nanoplastics enhance the toxicological effects of DDE in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae	The Science of the Total Environment		1879-1026	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160457		Anthropogenic releases of plastics, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and heavy metals can impact the environment, including aquatic ecosystems. Nanoplastics (NPs) have recently emerged as pervasive environmental pollutants that have the ability to adsorb POPs and can cause stress in organisms. Among POPs, DDT and its metabolites are ubiquitous environmental pollutants due to their long persistence. Despite the discontinued use of DDT in Europe, DDT and its metabolites (primarily p,p'-DDE) are still found at detectable levels in fish feed used in salmon aquaculture. Our study aimed to look at the individual and combined toxicity of NPs (50 mg/L polystyrene) and DDE (100 μg/L) using zebrafish larvae as a model. We found no significant morphological, cardiac, respiratory, or behavioural changes in zebrafish larvae exposed to NPs alone. Conversely, morphological, cardiac and respiratory alterations were observed in zebrafish larvae exposed to DDE and NPs + DDE. Interestingly, behavioural changes were only observed in zebrafish larvae exposed to NPs + DDE. These findings were supported by RNA-seq results, which showed that some cardiac, vascular, and immunogenic pathways were downregulated only in zebrafish larvae exposed to NPs + DDE. In summary, we found an enhanced toxicological impact of DDE when combined with NPs.	2023-02-10	2024-03-06 20:18:48	2024-03-06T20:18:48Z		160457		Pt 2	859		Sci Total Environ								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36435242					Animals; Behavioural toxicity; Cardiotoxicity; DDT; DanioVision system; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Larva; Polystyrenes; Respiration; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

In this study, we used a stab wound injury model in zebrafish and identified an injury-induced microglial state characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43)+ condensates. Granulin-mediated clearance of both lipid droplets and TDP-43+ condensates was necessary and sufficient to promote the return of microglia back to the basal state and achieve scarless regeneration. Moreover, in postmortem cortical brain tissues from patients with traumatic brain injury, the extent of microglial activation correlated with the accumulation of lipid droplets and TDP-43+ condensates. Together, our results reveal a mechanism required for restoring microglia to a nonactivated state after injury, which has potential for new therapeutic applications in humans.	2022-12	2024-03-06 20:18:47	2024-03-06T20:18:47Z		1608-1625		12	25		Nat Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36424432					Animals; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; DNA-Binding Proteins; Humans; Lipid Droplets; Microglia; Regeneration; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
DR769WPB	journalArticle	2022	Zhang, Xue; Yang, Yuxi; Wei, Yuxuan; Zhao, Qingshun; Lou, Xin	blf and the drl cluster synergistically regulate cell fate commitment during zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.200919		Hematopoiesis is a highly coordinated process that generates all the body's blood cells, and perturbations in embryonic hematopoiesis may result in illnesses ranging from fetal anemia to various leukemias. Correct establishment of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate is essential for the development of adequate blood cell subpopulations, although regulators of cell fate commitment have not been fully defined. Here, we show that primary erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis in zebrafish embryos are synergistically regulated by blf and the drl cluster, as simultaneous depletion led to severe erythrocyte aplasia and excessive macrophage formation at the expense of neutrophil development. Integrative analysis of transcriptome- and genome-wide binding data revealed that blf and drl cluster genes are responsible for constraining the expression of vasculogenesis-promoting genes in the intermediate cell mass and monocytopoiesis-promoting genes in the rostral blood island. This indicates that blf and drl cluster genes act as determinants of the fate commitment of erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells. Furthermore, a rescue screen demonstrated that Zfp932 is a potential mammalian functional equivalent to zebrafish blf and drl cluster genes.

RVBEBH5T	journalArticle	2023	Wei, Ya-Lan; Lei, Yu-Qing; Ye, Zhou-Jie; Zhuang, Xu-Dong; Zhu, Li-Ping; Wang, Xin-Rui; Cao, Hua	Effects of bepridil on early cardiac development of zebrafish	Cell and Tissue Research		1432-0878	10.1007/s00441-022-03706-w		Bepridil is a commonly used medication for arrhythmia and heart failure. It primarily exerts hemodynamic effects by inhibiting Na+/K+ movement and regulating the Na+/Ca2+ exchange. In comparison to other Ca2+ inhibitors, bepridil has a long half-life and a complex pharmacology. Additionally, it is widely used in antiviral research and the treatment of various diseases. However, the toxicity of this compound and its other possible effects on embryonic development are unknown. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of bepridil on rat myocardial H9c2 cells. After treatment with bepridil, the cells became overloaded with Ca2+ and entered a state of cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear abnormality. Bepridil treatment resulted in several morphological abnormalities in zebrafish embryo models, including pericardium enlargement, yolk sac swelling, and growth stunting. The hemodynamic effects on fetal development resulted in abnormal cardiovascular circulation and myocardial weakness. After inhibiting the Ca2+ transmembrane, the liver of zebrafish larvae also displayed an ectopic and deficient spatial location. Additionally, the results of the RNA-seq analysis revealed the detailed gene expression profiles and metabolic responses to bepridil treatment in zebrafish embryonic development. Taken together, our study provides an important evaluation of antiarrhythmic agents for clinical use in prenatal heart patients.	2023-02	2024-03-06 20:18:47	2024-03-06T20:18:47Z		375-391		2	391		Cell Tissue Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36422735 PMCID: PMC9686465					Animals; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Apoptosis; Bepridil; Cardiac development; Cardiotoxicity; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative stress; Rats; Zebrafish

Myostatin is a negative regulator of adult neurogenesis after spinal cord injury in zebrafish	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111705		Intrinsic and extrinsic inhibition of neuronal regeneration obstruct spinal cord (SC) repair in mammals. In contrast, adult zebrafish achieve functional recovery after complete SC transection. While studies of innate SC regeneration have focused on axon regrowth as a primary repair mechanism, how local adult neurogenesis affects functional recovery is unknown. Here, we uncover dynamic expression of zebrafish myostatin b (mstnb) in a niche of dorsal SC progenitors after injury. mstnb mutants show impaired functional recovery, normal glial and axonal bridging across the lesion, and an increase in the profiles of newborn neurons. Molecularly, neuron differentiation genes are upregulated, while the neural stem cell maintenance gene fgf1b is downregulated in mstnb mutants. Finally, we show that human fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) treatment rescues the molecular and cellular phenotypes of mstnb mutants. These studies uncover unanticipated neurogenic functions for mstnb and establish the importance of local adult neurogenesis for innate SC repair.	2022-11-22	2024-03-06 20:18:47	2024-03-06T20:18:47Z		111705		8	41		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36417881 PMCID: PMC9742758					Adult; Animals; CP: Developmental biology; CP: Neuroscience; Fibroblast Growth Factor 1; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Mammals; Myostatin; Neurogenesis; Recovery of Function; Spinal Cord Injuries; Zebrafish; adult neurogenesis; eural stem cells; myostatin; neuronal differentiation; regeneration; spinal cord injury; zebrafish

Top2a promotes the development of social behavior via PRC2 and H3K27me3	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.abm7069		Little is understood about the embryonic development of sociality. We screened 1120 known drugs and found that embryonic inhibition of topoisomerase IIα (Top2a) resulted in lasting social deficits in zebrafish. In mice, prenatal Top2 inhibition caused defects in social interaction and communication, which are behaviors that relate to core symptoms of autism. Mutation of Top2a in zebrafish caused down-regulation of a set of genes highly enriched for genes associated with autism in humans. Both the Top2a-regulated and autism-associated gene sets have binding sites for polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a regulatory complex responsible for H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Moreover, both gene sets are highly enriched for H3K27me3. Inhibition of the PRC2 component Ezh2 rescued social deficits caused by Top2 inhibition. Therefore, Top2a is a key component of an evolutionarily conserved pathway that promotes the development of social behavior through PRC2 and H3K27me3.	2022-11-25	2024-03-06 20:18:46	2024-03-06T20:18:46Z		eabm7069		47	8		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36417527 PMCID: PMC9683714

However, the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. There are two homologous genes of TULP1 in zebrafish, namely tulp1a and tulp1b. Here, we generated the single knockout (tulp1a-/- and tulp1b-/-) and double knockout (tulp1-dKO) models in zebrafish. Knockout of tulp1a resulted in the mislocalization of UV cone opsins and the degeneration of UV cones specifically, while knockout of tulp1b resulted in mislocalization of rod opsins and rod-cone degeneration. In the tulp1-dKO zebrafish, mislocalization of opsins was present in all types of photoreceptors, and severe degeneration was observed at a very early age, mimicking the clinical manifestations of TULP1 patients. Photoreceptor cilium length was significantly reduced in the tulp1-dKO retinas. RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of tektin2 (tekt2), a ciliary and flagellar microtubule structural component, was downregulated in the tulp1-dKO zebrafish. Dual-luciferase reporter assay suggested that Tulp1a and Tulp1b transcriptionally activate the promoter of tekt2. In addition, ferroptosis might be activated in the tulp1-dKO zebrafish, as suggested by the up-regulation of genes related to the ferroptosis pathway, the shrinkage of mitochondria, reduction or disappearance of mitochondria cristae, and the iron and lipid droplet deposition in the retina of tulp1-dKO zebrafish. In conclusion, our study establishes an appropriate zebrafish model for TULP1-associated retinal degeneration and proposes that loss of TULP1 causes defects in cilia structure and opsin trafficking through the downregulation of tekt2, which further increases the death of photoreceptors via ferroptosis. These findings offer insight into the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of early-onset retinal degeneration.	2022-11-17	2024-03-06 20:18:46	2024-03-06T20:18:46Z		962		11	13		Cell Death Dis								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36396940 PMCID: PMC9672332					Animals; Eye Proteins; Ferroptosis; Humans; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; Retinal Degeneration; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
JCC89YE6	journalArticle	2023	Hayot, Gaëlle; Massonot, Mathieu; Keime, Céline; Faure, Elodie; Golzio, Christelle	Loss of autism-candidate CHD8 perturbs neural crest development and intestinal homeostatic balance	Life Science Alliance		2575-1077	10.26508/lsa.202201456		Individuals with mutations in CHD8 present with gastrointestinal complaints, yet the underlying mechanisms are understudied. Here, using a stable constitutive chd8 mutant zebrafish model, we found that the loss of chd8 leads to a reduced number of vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), enteric neural and glial progenitors, emigrating from the neural tube, and that their early migration capability was altered. At later stages, although the intestinal colonization by NCCs was complete, we found the decreased numbers of both serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and NCC-derived serotonergic neurons, suggesting an intestinal hyposerotonemia in the absence of chd8 Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses revealed an altered expression of key receptors and enzymes in serotonin and acetylcholine signaling pathways. The tissue examination of chd8 mutants revealed a thinner intestinal epithelium accompanied by an accumulation of neutrophils and the decreased numbers of goblet cells and eosinophils. Last, single-cell sequencing of whole intestines showed a global disruption of the immune balance with a perturbed expression of inflammatory interleukins and changes in immune cell clusters. Our findings propose a causal developmental link between chd8, NCC development, intestinal homeostasis, and autism-associated gastrointestinal complaints.	2023-01	2024-03-06 20:18:46	2024-03-06T20:18:46Z		e202201456		1	6		Life Sci Alliance								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36375841 PMCID: PMC9664244					Animals; Autistic Disorder; Cell Movement; Homeostasis; Intestines; Neural Crest; Serotonin; Zebrafish

As these cells migrate into the pharyngeal arches, they downregulate neural crest specifier genes and upregulate so-called ectomesenchyme genes that are characteristic of skeletal progenitors. Although both external and intrinsic factors have been proposed as triggers of this transition, the details remain obscure. Here, we report the Nr2f nuclear receptors as intrinsic activators of the ectomesenchyme program: zebrafish nr2f5 single and nr2f2;nr2f5 double mutants show marked delays in upregulation of ectomesenchyme genes, such as dlx2a, prrx1a, prrx1b, sox9a, twist1a and fli1a, and in downregulation of sox10, which is normally restricted to early neural crest and non-ectomesenchyme lineages. Mutation of sox10 fully rescued skeletal development in nr2f5 single but not nr2f2;nr2f5 double mutants, but the initial ectomesenchyme delay persisted in both. Sox10 perdurance thus antagonizes the recovery but does not explain the impaired ectomesenchyme transition. Unraveling the mechanisms of Nr2f function will help solve the enduring puzzle of how cranial neural crest cells transition to the skeletal progenitor state.	2022-12-01	2024-03-06 20:18:46	2024-03-06T20:18:46Z		dev201133		23	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36367707 PMCID: PMC10114104					Animals; Cranial neural crest; Ectomesenchyme; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Mesoderm; Neural Crest; Neural Plate; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Zebrafish; nr2f2; nr2f5; sox10

GNE encodes a bi-functional enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step of sialic acid biosynthesis pathway. However, the process in which GNE mutations lead to the development of a muscle pathology is not clear yet. Cellular and mouse models for GNE Myopathy established to date have not been informative. Further, additional GNE functions in muscle have been hypothesized. In these studies, we aimed to investigate gne functions using zebrafish genetic and transgenic models, and characterized them using macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular approaches. We first established transgenic zebrafish lineages expressing the human GNE cDNA carrying the M743T mutation, driven by the zebrafish gne promoter. These fish developed entirely normally. Then, we generated a gne knocked-out (KO) fish using the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology. These fish died 8-10 days post-fertilization (dpf), but a phenotype appeared less than 24 h before death and included progressive body axis curving, deflation of the swim bladder and decreasing movement and heart rate. However, muscle histology uncovered severe defects, already at 5 dpf, with compromised fiber organization. Sialic acid supplementation did not rescue the larvae from this phenotype nor prolonged their lifespan. To have deeper insights into the potential functions of gne in zebrafish, RNA sequencing was performed at 3 time points (3, 5, and 7 dpf). Genotype clustering was progressive, with only 5 genes differentially expressed in gne KO compared to gne WT siblings at 3 dpf. Enrichment analyses of the primary processes affected by the lack of gne also at 5 and 7 dpf point to the involvement of cell cycle and DNA damage/repair processes in the gne KO zebrafish. Thus, we have established a gne KO zebrafish lineage and obtained new insights into gne functions. This is the only model where GNE can be related to clear muscle defects, thus the only animal model relevant to GNE Myopathy to date. Further elucidation of gne precise mechanism-of-action in these processes could be relevant to GNE Myopathy and allow the identification of novel therapeutic targets.	2022	2024-03-06 20:18:45	2024-03-06T20:18:45Z		976111			10		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36353515 PMCID: PMC9637792					CRISPR/Cas9; DNA damage repair pathway; GNE; GNE myopathy; cell cycle; gne KO zebrafish; skeletal muscle; transcriptomics

Several emerging GCGR antagonism-based therapies are under preclinical and clinical development. However, GCGR antagonism, as well as genetically engineered GCGR deficiency in animal models, are accompanied by α-cell hyperplasia and hyperglucagonemia, which may limit the application of GCGR antagonism. To better understand the physiological changes in α cells following GCGR disruption, we performed single cell sequencing of α cells isolated from control and gcgr-/- (glucagon receptor deficient) zebrafish. Interestingly, beyond the α-cell hyperplasia, we also found that the expression of gcga, gcgb, pnoca, and several glucagon-regulatory transcription factors were dramatically increased in one cluster of gcgr-/- α cells. We further confirmed that glucagon mRNA was upregulated in gcgr-/- animals by in situ hybridization and that glucagon promoter activity was increased in gcgr-/-;Tg(gcga:GFP) reporter zebrafish. We also demonstrated that gcgr-/- α cells had increased glucagon protein levels and increased granules after GCGR disruption. Intriguingly, the increased mRNA and protein levels could be suppressed by treatment with high-level glucose or knockdown of the pnoca gene. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that GCGR deficiency not only induced α-cell hyperplasia but also increased glucagon expression in α cells, findings which provide more information about physiological changes in α-cells when the GCGR is disrupted.	2022-12	2024-03-06 20:18:45	2024-03-06T20:18:45Z		102665		12	298		J Biol Chem								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36334626 PMCID: PMC9719020					Animals; Glucagon; Glucagon receptor; Hyperplasia; Pancreatic α-cells; RNA, Messenger; Receptors, Glucagon; Single-cell sequencing; Zebrafish

Geoffrey	RBPMS2 Is a Myocardial-Enriched Splicing Regulator Required for Cardiac Function	Circulation Research		1524-4571	10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321728		BACKGROUND: RBPs (RNA-binding proteins) perform indispensable functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Numerous RBPs have been implicated in cardiac development or physiology based on gene knockout studies and the identification of pathogenic RBP gene mutations in monogenic heart disorders. The discovery and characterization of additional RBPs performing indispensable functions in the heart will advance basic and translational cardiovascular research. METHODS: We performed a differential expression screen in zebrafish embryos to identify genes enriched in nkx2.5-positive cardiomyocytes or cardiopharyngeal progenitors compared to nkx2.5-negative cells from the same embryos. We investigated the myocardial-enriched gene RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (variants) 2 [RBPMS2)] by generating and characterizing rbpms2 knockout zebrafish and human cardiomyocytes derived from RBPMS2-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: We identified 1848 genes enriched in the nkx2.5-positive population. Among the most highly enriched genes, most with well-established functions in the heart, we discovered the ohnologs rbpms2a and rbpms2b, which encode an evolutionarily conserved RBP. Rbpms2 localizes selectively to cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart development and strong cardiomyocyte expression persists into adulthood. Rbpms2-deficient embryos suffer from early cardiac dysfunction characterized by reduced ejection fraction. The functional deficit is accompanied by myofibril disarray, altered calcium handling, and differential alternative splicing events in mutant cardiomyocytes. These phenotypes are also observed in RBPMS2-deficient human cardiomyocytes, indicative of conserved molecular and cellular function. RNA-sequencing and comparative analysis of genes mis-spliced in RBPMS2-deficient zebrafish and human cardiomyocytes uncovered a conserved network of 29 ortholog pairs that require RBPMS2 for alternative splicing regulation, including RBFOX2, SLC8A1, and MYBPC3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies RBPMS2 as a conserved regulator of alternative splicing, myofibrillar organization, and calcium handling in zebrafish and human cardiomyocytes.	2022-12-02	2024-03-06 20:18:45	2024-03-06T20:18:45Z		980-1000		12	131		Circ Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36367103 PMCID: PMC9770155					Animals; Calcium; Humans; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; RNA Splicing Factors; RNA-Binding Proteins; RNA-binding proteins; Repressor Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; alternative splicing; human induced pluripotent stem cells; myocytes, cardiac; zebrafish

Diverse animal models offer valuable tools to recapitulate different aspects of AML and link in vitro studies to clinical trials. We generated a double transgenic zebrafish that enables hoxa9 overexpression in blood cells under the draculin (drl) regulatory element and an inducible expression of meis1 through a heat shock promoter. After induction, Tg(drl:hoxa9;hsp70:meis1) embryos developed a preleukaemic state with reduced myeloid and erythroid differentiation coupled with the poor production of haematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Importantly, most adult Tg(drl:hoxa9;hsp70:meis1) fish at 3 months old showed abundant accumulations of immature myeloid precursors, interrupted differentiation and anaemia in the kidney marrow, and infiltration of myeloid precursors in peripheral blood, resembling human AML. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis also confirmed AML transformation by the transgene. Moreover, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor that reduces leukaemogenesis in mammals effectively restored haematopoiesis in Tg(drl:hoxa9;hsp70:meis1) embryos and improved their late survival. Thus, Tg(drl:hoxa9;hsp70:meis1) zebrafish is a rapid-onset high-penetrance AML-like disease model, which provides a novel tool to harness the unique advantages of zebrafish for mechanistic studies and drug screening against HOXA9/MEIS1 overexpressed high-risk AML.	2022-10	2024-03-06 20:18:44	2024-03-06T20:18:44Z		220172		10	12		Open Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36285442 PMCID: PMC9597180					Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Child, Preschool; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Mammals; Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein; Neoplasm Proteins; Penetrance; Zebrafish; acute myeloid leukaemia; hoxa9; meis1; myeloid malignancy; transgenic zebrafish model

To characterize the spatial organization of mitochondrial gene products in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we sequenced RNA from different cellular fractions. Our results confirmed the presence of nuclear-encoded mRNAs in the mitochondrial fraction, which in unperturbed conditions, are mainly transcripts encoding large proteins with specific properties, like transmembrane domains. To further explore the principles of mitochondrial protein compartmentalization in zebrafish, we quantified the transcriptomic changes for each subcellular fraction triggered by the chchd4a -/- mutation, causing the disorders in the mitochondrial protein import. Our results indicate that the proteostatic stress further restricts the population of transcripts on the mitochondrial surface, allowing only the largest and the most evolutionary conserved proteins to be synthetized there. We also show that many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts translated by the cytosolic ribosomes stay resistant to the global translation shutdown. Thus, vertebrates, in contrast to yeast, are not likely to use localized translation to facilitate synthesis of mitochondrial proteins under proteostatic stress conditions.	2023-01	2024-03-06 20:18:44	2024-03-06T20:18:44Z		e202201514		1	6		Life Sci Alliance								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36283702 PMCID: PMC9595208					Animals; Genes, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Zebrafish

In mammals, depletion or inhibition of SCD activity generally leads to a decrease in triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. However, the endogenous role of scd in teleost fish remains unknown. Here, we generated a zebrafish scd mutant (scd-/-) to elucidate the role of scd in lipid metabolism and sexual development. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the scd-/- mutants had increased levels of saturated fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0, and decreased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids C16:1 and C18:1. The mutant fish displayed a short stature and an enlarged abdomen during development. Unlike Scd-/- mammals, the scd-/- zebrafish showed significantly increased fat accumulation in the whole body, especially in the liver, leading to hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and severe cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, srebf1, a gene encoding a transcriptional activator related to adipogenesis, acc1 and acaca, genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and dgat2, a key gene involved in triglyceride synthesis, were significantly upregulated in mutant livers to activate fatty acid biosynthesis and adipogenesis. The scd-/- males exhibited defective natural mating behavior due to defective genital papillae but possessed functional mature sperm. All defects in the scd-/- mutants could be rescued by ubiquitous transgenic overexpression of scd. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that scd is indispensable for maintaining lipid homeostasis and development of secondary sexual characteristics in zebrafish.	2023-01-18	2024-03-06 20:18:44	2024-03-06T20:18:44Z		63-77		1	44		Zool Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36317480 PMCID: PMC9841191					Animals; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Lipid homeostasis; Liver; Male; Mammals; Reproduction; Semen; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Zebrafish; scd

This study aims to investigate the effect of LRPAP1 defect on ocular refractive development and its involved mechanism. METHODS: A lrpap1 mutant zebrafish line with homozygous frameshift mutation was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The ocular refractive phenotype was analyzed by calculating the relative refractive error (RRE) with vivo photography and histological analysis at different development stages, together with examining ocular structure change via transmission electron microscopy. Further, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed. The potentially involved signaling pathway as well as the interacted protein were investigated in vivo. RESULTS: The lrpap1 homozygous mutant zebrafish line showed myopic phenotype. Specifically, the mutant lines showed larger eye axial length-to-body length in one-month old individuals and a myopic shift with an RRE that changed after two months. Collagen fibers became thinning and disordered in the sclera. Further, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis indicated that apoptosis signaling was activated in mutant line; this was further confirmed by acridine orange and TUNEL staining. Moreover, the expression of TGF-β protein was elevated in the mutant lines. Finally, the treatment of wild-type embryos with a TGF-β agonist aggravated the degree of eyeball apoptosis; conversely, the use of a TGF-β inhibitor mitigated apoptosis in mutant embryos. CONCLUSION: The study provides functional evidence of a link between lrpap1 and myopia, suggesting that lrpap1 deficiency could lead to myopia through TGF-β-induced apoptosis signaling.

In pld6 mutants, GSPCs fail to differentiate and undergo apoptosis, leading to masculinization and infertility. Mitochondrial fusion in pld6-depleted GSPCs is severely impaired, and the mutants exhibit defects in piRNA biogenesis and transposon suppression. Overall, this work uncovers zebrafish Pld6 as a novel germline-specific regulator of mitochondrial fusion, and highlights its essential role in the maintenance and differentiation of GSPCs as well as gonadal development and gametogenesis.	2022-12	2024-03-06 20:18:43	2024-03-06T20:18:43Z		e2203631		36	9		Adv Sci (Weinh)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36257818 PMCID: PMC9798980					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Germ Cells; Male; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Pld6; Stem Cells; Zebrafish; gametogenesis; germline stem cells; mitochondrial dynamics; progenitor cells

Identification of environmental factors that promote intestinal inflammation	Nature		1476-4687	10.1038/s41586-022-05308-6		Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)1-a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity2. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR-NF-κB-C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases.	2022-11	2024-03-06 20:18:43	2024-03-06T20:18:43Z		801-809		7937	611		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36266581 PMCID: PMC9898826					Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta; Databases, Factual; Dendritic Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Environment; Herbicides; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intestines; Machine Learning; Mice; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; T-Lymphocytes; Zebrafish

The scaffold protein Shoc2 is a critical modulator of ERK1/2 signals, and mutations in the shoc2 gene lead to the human developmental disease known as Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NSLH). The loss of Shoc2 and the shoc2 NSLH-causing mutations affect the tissues of neural crest (NC) origin. In this study, we utilized the zebrafish model to dissect the role of Shoc2-ERK1/2 signals in the development of NC. These studies established that the loss of Shoc2 significantly altered the expression of transcription factors regulating the specification and differentiation of NC cells. Using comparative transcriptome analysis of NC-derived cells from shoc2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutant larvae, we found that Shoc2-mediated signals regulate gene programs at several levels, including expression of genes coding for the proteins of extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM regulators. Together, our results demonstrate that Shoc2 is an essential regulator of NC development. This study also indicates that disbalance in the turnover of the ECM may lead to the abnormalities found in NSLH patients.	2022-12	2024-03-06 20:18:43	2024-03-06T20:18:43Z		156-171			492		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36265687 PMCID: PMC10019579					Animals; ERK1/2; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Loose Anagen Hair Syndrome; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Neural Crest; Neural crest; Noonan Syndrome; Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NSLH); Shoc2; Zebrafish

However, the mechanism by which the brain milieu confers microglial maturation signature remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the baxcq55 zebrafish and Baxtm1Sjk mouse embryos exhibit similarly defective early microglial maturation. BAX, a typical pro-apoptotic factor, is highly enriched in neuronal cells and regulates microglial maturation through both pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms. BAX regulates dlb via the CaMKII-CREB axis calcium-dependently in living neurons while ensuring the efficient Notch activation in the immigrated pre-microglia by apoptotic neurons. Notch signaling is conserved in supporting embryonic microglia maturation. Compromised microglial development occurred in the Cx3cr1Cre/+Rbpjfl/fl embryonic mice; however, microglia acquire their appropriate signature when incubated with DLL3 in vitro. Thus, our findings elucidate a BAX-CaMKII-CREB-Notch network triggered by the neuronal milieu in microglial development, which may provide innovative insights for targeting microglia in neuronal disorder treatment.	2022-10-17	2024-03-06 20:18:42	2024-03-06T20:18:42Z		6117		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36253375 PMCID: PMC9576735					Animals; Brain; Calcium; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; Mice; Microglia; Zebrafish; bcl-2-Associated X Protein

Here, we generated whole-body single-cell transcriptomic landscapes of zebrafish, Drosophila and earthworm. We then integrated cell landscapes from eight representative metazoan species to study gene regulation across evolution. Using these uniformly constructed cross-species landscapes, we developed a deep-learning-based strategy, Nvwa, to predict gene expression and identify regulatory sequences at the single-cell level. We systematically compared cell-type-specific transcription factors to reveal conserved genetic regulation in vertebrates and invertebrates. Our work provides a valuable resource and offers a new strategy for studying regulatory grammar in diverse biological systems.	2022-11	2024-03-06 20:18:42	2024-03-06T20:18:42Z		1711-1720		11	54		Nat Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36229673					Animals; Conserved Sequence; Deep Learning; Drosophila; Gene Expression Regulation; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

Pax3 loss of function delays tumour progression in kRAS-induced zebrafish rhabdomyosarcoma models	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-022-21525-5		Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue cancer that arises in skeletal muscle due to mutations in myogenic progenitors that lead to ineffective differentiation and malignant transformation. The transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 and their downstream target genes are tightly linked with the fusion positive alveolar subtype, whereas the RAS pathway is usually involved in the embryonal, fusion negative variant. Here, we analyse the role of Pax3 in a fusion negative context, by linking alterations in gene expression in pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish with tumour progression in kRAS-induced rhabdomyosarcoma tumours. Several genes in the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway were significantly down-regulated in pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish. Progression of rhabdomyosarcoma tumours was also delayed in the pax3a/pax3b double mutant zebrafish indicating that Pax3 transcription factors have an unappreciated role in mediating malignancy in fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma.	2022-10-13	2024-03-06 20:18:42	2024-03-06T20:18:42Z		17149		1	12		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36229514 PMCID: PMC9561152					Animals; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; PAX3 Transcription Factor; PAX7 Transcription Factor; Paired Box Transcription Factors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rhabdomyosarcoma; Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Conserved roles for Hnf4 family transcription factors in zebrafish development and intestinal function	Genetics		1943-2631	10.1093/genetics/iyac133		Transcription factors play important roles in the development of the intestinal epithelium and its ability to respond to endocrine, nutritional, and microbial signals. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 family nuclear receptors are liganded transcription factors that are critical for the development and function of multiple digestive organs in vertebrates, including the intestinal epithelium. Zebrafish have 3 hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 homologs, of which, hnf4a was previously shown to mediate intestinal responses to microbiota in zebrafish larvae. To discern the functions of other hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 family members in zebrafish development and intestinal function, we created and characterized mutations in hnf4g and hnf4b. We addressed the possibility of genetic redundancy amongst these factors by creating double and triple mutants which showed different rates of survival, including apparent early lethality in hnf4a; hnf4b double mutants and triple mutants. RNA sequencing performed on digestive tracts from single and double mutant larvae revealed extensive changes in intestinal gene expression in hnf4a mutants that were amplified in hnf4a; hnf4g mutants, but limited in hnf4g mutants. Changes in hnf4a and hnf4a; hnf4g mutants were reminiscent of those seen in mice including decreased expression of genes involved in intestinal function and increased expression of cell proliferation genes, and were validated using transgenic reporters and EdU labeling in the intestinal epithelium. Gnotobiotics combined with RNA sequencing also showed hnf4g has subtler roles than hnf4a in host responses to microbiota. Overall, phenotypic changes in hnf4a single mutants were strongly enhanced in hnf4a; hnf4g double mutants, suggesting a conserved partial genetic redundancy between hnf4a and hnf4g in the vertebrate intestine.	2022-11-30	2024-03-06 20:18:41	2024-03-06T20:18:41Z		iyac133		4	222		Genetics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36218393 PMCID: PMC9713462					Animals; HNF4; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestines; NR2A; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; host–microbe interaction; intestine; microbiota; nuclear receptor; transcription factor; zebrafish development

A regulatory network of Sox and Six transcription factors initiate a cell fate transformation during hearing regeneration in adult zebrafish	Cell Genomics		2666-979X	10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100170		Using adult zebrafish inner ears as a model for sensorineural regeneration, we ablated the mechanosensory receptors and characterized the single-cell epigenome and transcriptome at consecutive time points during hair cell regeneration. We utilized deep learning on the regeneration-induced open chromatin sequences and identified cell-specific transcription factor (TF) motif patterns. Enhancer activity correlated with gene expression and identified potential gene regulatory networks. A pattern of overlapping Sox- and Six-family TF gene expression and binding motifs was detected, suggesting a combinatorial program of TFs driving regeneration and cell identity. Pseudotime analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data suggested that support cells within the sensory epithelium changed cell identity to a "progenitor" cell population that could differentiate into hair cells. We identified a 2.6 kb DNA enhancer upstream of the sox2 promoter that, when deleted, showed a dominant phenotype that resulted in a hair-cell-regeneration-specific deficit in both the lateral line and adult inner ear.	2022-09-14	2024-03-06 20:18:41	2024-03-06T20:18:41Z		100170		9	2		Cell Genom								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36212030 PMCID: PMC9540346

Transcriptome signatures of wastewater effluent exposure in larval zebrafish vary with seasonal mixture composition in an effluent-dominated stream	The Science of the Total Environment		1879-1026	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159069		Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent-dominated streams provide critical habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms but also continually expose them to complex mixtures of pharmaceuticals that can potentially impair growth, behavior, and reproduction. Currently, few biomarkers are available that relate to pharmaceutical-specific mechanisms of action. In the experiment reported in this paper, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at two developmental stages were exposed to water samples from three sampling sites (0.1 km upstream of the outfall, at the effluent outfall, and 0.1 km below the outfall) during base-flow conditions from two months (January and May) of a temperate-region effluent-dominated stream containing a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern. RNA-sequencing identified potential biological impacts and biomarkers of WWTP effluent exposure that extend past traditional markers of endocrine disruption. Transcriptomics revealed changes to a wide range of biological functions and pathways including cardiac, neurological, visual, metabolic, and signaling pathways. These transcriptomic changes varied by developmental stage and displayed sensitivity to variable chemical composition and concentration of effluent, thus indicating a need for stage-specific biomarkers. Some transcripts are known to be associated with genes related to pharmaceuticals that were present in the collected samples. Although traditional biomarkers of endocrine disruption were not enriched in either month, a high estrogenicity signal was detected upstream in May and implicates the presence of unidentified chemical inputs not captured by the targeted chemical analysis. This work reveals associations between bioeffects of exposure, stage of development, and the composition of chemical mixtures in effluent-dominated surface water. The work underscores the importance of measuring effects beyond the endocrine system when assessing the impact of bioactive chemicals in WWTP effluent and identifies a need for non-targeted chemical analysis when bioeffects are not explained by the targeted analysis.	2023-01-15	2024-03-06 20:18:41	2024-03-06T20:18:41Z		159069		Pt 2	856		Sci Total Environ								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36174698					Animals; Biomarker; CECs; Estrogenicity; Larva; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmaceuticals; RNA sequencing; Rivers; Seasons; Transcriptome; WWTP; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish

Intrinsic myocardial defects underlie an Rbfox-deficient zebrafish model of hypoplastic left heart syndrome	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-022-32982-x		Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by underdevelopment of left sided structures including the ventricle, valves, and aorta. Prevailing paradigm suggests that HLHS is a multigenic disease of co-occurring phenotypes. Here, we report that zebrafish lacking two orthologs of the RNA binding protein RBFOX2, a gene linked to HLHS in humans, display cardiovascular defects overlapping those in HLHS patients including ventricular, valve, and aortic deficiencies. In contrast to current models, we demonstrate that these structural deficits arise secondary to impaired pump function as these phenotypes are rescued when Rbfox is specifically expressed in the myocardium. Mechanistically, we find diminished expression and alternative splicing of sarcomere and mitochondrial components that compromise sarcomere assembly and mitochondrial respiration, respectively. Injection of human RBFOX2 mRNA restores cardiovascular development in rbfox mutant zebrafish, while HLHS-linked RBFOX2 variants fail to rescue. This work supports an emerging paradigm for HLHS pathogenesis that centers on myocardial intrinsic defects.	2022-10-05	2024-03-06 20:18:41	2024-03-06T20:18:41Z		5877		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36198703 PMCID: PMC9534849					Animals; Humans; Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome; Myocardium; RNA Splicing Factors; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Zebrafish

Quality assurance of hematopoietic stem cells by macrophages determines stem cell clonality	Science (New York, N.Y.)		1095-9203	10.1126/science.abo4837		Tissue-specific stem cells persist for a lifetime and can differentiate to maintain homeostasis or transform to initiate cancer. Despite their importance, there are no described quality assurance mechanisms for newly formed stem cells. We observed intimate and specific interactions between macrophages and nascent blood stem cells in zebrafish embryos. Macrophage interactions frequently led to either removal of cytoplasmic material and stem cell division or complete engulfment and stem cell death. Stressed stem cells were marked by surface Calreticulin, which stimulated macrophage interactions. Using cellular barcoding, we found that Calreticulin knock-down or embryonic macrophage depletion reduced the number of stem cell clones that established adult hematopoiesis. Our work supports a model in which embryonic macrophages determine hematopoietic clonality by monitoring stem cell quality.	2022-09-23	2024-03-06 20:18:40	2024-03-06T20:18:40Z		1413-1419		6613	377		Science								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36137040 PMCID: PMC9524573					Animals; Apoptosis; Calbindin 2; Calreticulin; Cell Communication; Clonal Hematopoiesis; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Macrophages; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The developing epicardium regulates cardiac chamber morphogenesis by promoting cardiomyocyte growth	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.049571		The epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, is an important regulator of cardiac regeneration. However, a detailed understanding of the crosstalk between the epicardium and myocardium during development requires further investigation. Here, we generated three models of epicardial impairment in zebrafish by mutating the transcription factor genes tcf21 and wt1a, and ablating tcf21+ epicardial cells. Notably, all three epicardial impairment models exhibited smaller ventricles. We identified the initial cause of this phenotype as defective cardiomyocyte growth, resulting in reduced cell surface and volume. This failure of cardiomyocyte growth was followed by decreased proliferation and increased abluminal extrusion. By temporally manipulating its ablation, we show that the epicardium is required to support cardiomyocyte growth mainly during early cardiac morphogenesis. By transcriptomic profiling of sorted epicardial cells, we identified reduced expression of FGF and VEGF ligand genes in tcf21-/- hearts, and pharmacological inhibition of these signaling pathways in wild type partially recapitulated the ventricular growth defects. Taken together, these data reveal distinct roles of the epicardium during cardiac morphogenesis and signaling pathways underlying epicardial-myocardial crosstalk.	2023-05-01	2024-03-06 20:18:40	2024-03-06T20:18:40Z		dmm049571		5	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36172839 PMCID: PMC9612869					Animals; Cardiomyocytes; Cell growth; Epicardium; Heart; Heart development; Inter-tissue crosstalk; Ligands; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organogenesis; Pericardium; Transcription Factors; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; WT1 Proteins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Studies of ZRSR2-depleted cell lines and ZRSR2-mutated patient samples revealed its essential role in the U12-dependent minor spliceosome. However, the role of ZRSR2 during embryonic development is not clear, as its function is compensated for by Zrsr1 in mice. Here, we utilized the zebrafish model to investigate the role of zrsr2 during embryonic development. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a zrsr2-knockout zebrafish line, termed zrsr2hg129/hg129 (p.Trp167Argfs*9) and examined embryo development in the homozygous mutant embryos. zrsr2hg129/hg129 embryos displayed multiple developmental defects starting at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) and died after 8 dpf, suggesting that proper Zrsr2 function is required during embryonic development. The global transcriptome analysis of 3 dpf zrsr2hg129/hg129 embryos revealed that the loss of Zrsr2 results in the downregulation of essential metabolic pathways and the aberrant retention of minor introns in about one-third of all minor intron-containing genes in zebrafish. Overall, our study has demonstrated that the role of Zrsr2 as a component of the minor spliceosome is conserved and critical for proper embryonic development in zebrafish.	2022-09-14	2024-03-06 20:18:40	2024-03-06T20:18:40Z		10668		18	23		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36142581 PMCID: PMC9501576					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9; Embryonic Development; Introns; Mice; RNA Splice Sites; RNA Splicing; RNA Splicing Factors; Ribonucleoproteins; Spliceosomes; U12 introns; ZRSR2; Zebrafish; intron retention; zebrafish

Here we utilized genome-wide high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K9ac and H3K9me3, carried out on regenerative cardiac tissues at different days post amputation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate dynamic changes in gene expression and the epigenetic landscape of H3K9ac and H3K9me3. The STAR, Bowtie2, MACS2, and deepTools2 were mainly used for RNA-Seq or ChIP-seq data analysis. In this article, we present detailed information on experiment design, data generation, quality assessment and processing pipeline.

Previous studies have shown that naturally occurring neuronal apoptosis plays a critical role in regulating microglial colonization of the brain in zebrafish. However, the molecular signaling cascades underlying neuronal apoptosis-mediated microglial colonization and the regulation of these cascades remain undefined. Here, we show that basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) transcription factors, Mafba and Mafbb, two zebrafish orthologs of mammalian MAFB, are key regulators in neuronal apoptosis-mediated microglial colonization of the brain in zebrafish. We document that the loss of Mafba and Mafbb function perturbs microglial colonization of the brain. We further demonstrate that Mafba and Mafbb act cell-autonomously and cooperatively to orchestrate microglial colonization, at least in part, by regulating the expression of G protein-coupled receptor 34a (Gpr34a), which directs peripheral macrophage recruitment into the brain through sensing the lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) released by the apoptotic neurons. Our study reveals that Mafba and Mafbb regulate neuronal apoptosis-mediated microglial colonization of the brain in zebrafish via the lysoPS-Gpr34a pathway.	2022-09-27	2024-03-06 20:18:39	2024-03-06T20:18:39Z		e2203273119		39	119		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36122226 PMCID: PMC9522419					Animals; Brain; Chemotaxis; Gpr34a; Maf Transcription Factors; Mafb; Mammals; Microglia; Oncogene Proteins; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; colonization; lysoPS; microglia

Though it is known that the pMN progenitor cells can sequentially generate motor neurons and oligodendrocytes, the lineages of these progenitors are controversial and how their progeny are generated is not well understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, here, we identified a previously unknown heterogeneity among pMN progenitors with distinct fates and molecular signatures in zebrafish. Notably, we characterized two distinct motor neuron lineages using bioinformatic analysis. We then went on to investigate specific molecular programs that regulate neural progenitor fate transition. We validated experimentally that expression of the transcription factor myt1 (myelin transcription factor 1) and inner nuclear membrane integral proteins lbr (lamin B receptor) were critical for the development of motor neurons and neural progenitor maintenance, respectively. We anticipate that the transcriptome features and molecular programs identified in zebrafish pMN progenitors will not only provide an in-depth understanding of previous findings regarding the lineage analysis of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and motor neurons but will also help in further understanding of the molecular programming involved in neural progenitor fate transition.	2022-10	2024-03-06 20:18:39	2024-03-06T20:18:39Z		102452		10	298		J Biol Chem								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36063998 PMCID: PMC9530849					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Differentiation; Lamin B Receptor; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2; Oligodendroglia; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Spinal Cord; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; interneurons; motor neurons; oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; pMN progenitor cells; radial glia; single-cell RNA sequencing; zebrafish

A lysosomal regulatory circuit essential for the development and function of microglia	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.abp8321		As the primary phagocytic cells of the central nervous system, microglia exquisitely regulate their lysosomal activity to facilitate brain development and homeostasis. However, mechanisms that coordinate lysosomal activity with microglia development, chemotaxis, and function remain unclear. Here, we show that embryonic macrophages require the lysosomal guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RagA and the GTPase-activating protein Folliculin to colonize the brain in zebrafish. We demonstrate that embryonic macrophages in rraga mutants show increased expression of lysosomal genes but display significant down-regulation of immune- and chemotaxis-related genes. Furthermore, we find that RagA and Folliculin repress the key lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb and its homologs Tfe3a and Tfe3b in the macrophage lineage. Using RNA sequencing, we establish that Tfeb and Tfe3 are required for activation of lysosomal target genes under conditions of stress but not for basal expression of lysosomal pathways. Collectively, our data define a lysosomal regulatory circuit essential for macrophage development and function in vivo.	2022-09-02	2024-03-06 20:18:39	2024-03-06T20:18:39Z		eabp8321		35	8		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36044568 PMCID: PMC9432849

Although A-to-I editing occurs widely across animals and is well studied, new biological roles are still being discovered. Here, we study the role of A-to-I editing in early zebrafish development. We demonstrate that Adar, the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian ADAR1, is essential for establishing the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes and patterning. Genome-wide editing discovery reveals pervasive editing in maternal and the earliest zygotic transcripts, the majority of which occurred in the 3'-UTR. Interestingly, transcripts implicated in gastrulation as well as dorso-ventral and antero-posterior patterning are found to contain multiple editing sites. Adar knockdown or overexpression affect gene expression by 12 hpf. Analysis of adar-/- zygotic mutants further reveals that the previously described role of Adar in mammals in regulating the innate immune response is conserved in zebrafish. Our study therefore establishes distinct maternal and zygotic functions of RNA editing by Adar in embryonic patterning along the zebrafish antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, and in the regulation of the innate immune response, respectively.	2022-09-20	2024-03-06 20:18:39	2024-03-06T20:18:39Z		5520		1	13		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36127363 PMCID: PMC9489775					Adenosine; Animals; Immunity, Innate; Inosine; Mammals; RNA; RNA-Binding Proteins; Zebrafish

The variable forms of CD44 contribute to functional variations, which are not yet defined in teleost. Here, we show that zebrafish CD44a plays a protective role in the host defense against Edwardsiella piscicida infection. Zebrafish CD44a deficiency inhibits cell growth and proliferation, impairs cell growth and death pathways, and regulates the expression levels of many genes involved in p53 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, CD44a gene disruption in zebrafish leads to inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy, with the increased susceptibility to E. piscicida infection. Furthermore, we show that zebrafish CD44a variants including CD44a_tv1 and CD44a_tv2 promote the translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and interact with p53 in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, zebrafish CD44a_tv1 mediates the beneficial effect for larvae survival infected with E. piscicida is depending on the CASP8-mediated apoptosis. However, the antibacterial effect of zebrafish CD44a_tv2 depends on the cytoplasmic p53-mediated inhibition of autophagy. Collectively, our results identify that different mechanisms regulate CD44a variants-mediated antibacterial responses.	2022-08-30	2024-03-06 20:18:38	2024-03-06T20:18:38Z		889		1	5		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36042265 PMCID: PMC9427754					Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Immunity; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish

In zebrafish, there are two homologs of the mammalian Dnmt3a: Dnmt3aa and Dnmt3ab. A knockout (KO) mutant of zebrafish dnmt3aa was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system as a new model for DNA methylation research. Since zebrafish dnmt3aa KO mutants were viable and fertile, a maternal-zygotic dnmt3aa deficient mutant (MZdnmt3aa) was generated. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to reveal the DNA methylation profile using this mutant and identified genomic regions with altered CpG methylation as differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in this mutant compared to those in the wild-type fish. We provided novel raw and processed datasets using the MZdnmt3aa KO mutant, and the raw data of WGBS are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE178690.	2022-10	2024-03-06 20:18:38	2024-03-06T20:18:38Z		108514			44		Data Brief								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36034642 PMCID: PMC9399957					DNA methylation; Dnmt3aa; Whole genome bisulfate sequencing; Zebrafish

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanism underlying binaprofen‑induced liver injury at the genetic level. Zebrafish were treated with binaprofen. Serum biomarkers [alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) content analysis, liver cell morphology examination, DAPI staining, electron microscopy, microarray analysis and reverse transcription‑quantitative (RT‑q)PCR were performed 12, 24 and 48 h post‑treatment to analyze the mechanism underlying binaprofen‑induced liver injury. Following exposure to binaprofen, zebrafish serum levels of ALT, AST and LDH increased; MDA content of liver tissue increased and GSH content decreased. Liver cells exhibited mild to moderate vacuolization and mitochondria exhibited vacuolization and disrupted cristae. Liver cell apoptosis rate increased. There were 190 common differentially expressed genes at 12, 24 and 48 h. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the function of downregulated genes was primarily associated with 'DNA replication', 'DNA metabolic process', 'cell cycle', 'cell redox homeostasis', 'mitochondrion' and 'lipid transport'. The function of upregulated genes was primarily associated with 'peroxisome proliferator', 'oxidation activity', 'peroxisome' and 'apoptosis'. Pathway analysis showed that downregulated genes were those pertaining to 'cell cycle', 'DNA replication', 'ribosome', 'spliceosome', 'pyrimidine metabolism', 'purine metabolism', upregulated genes were those pertaining to 'PPAR signaling pathway', 'p53 signaling pathway'; RT‑qPCR assay supported the microarray results. The mechanism underlying binaprofen‑induced liver injury was associated with lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. Binaprofen downregulated genes associated with lipid transport and anti‑apoptosis genes, upregulated pro‑apoptosis genes and induces liver cell injury via the mitochondrial signaling pathway.	2022-10	2024-03-06 20:18:38	2024-03-06T20:18:38Z		314		4	26		Mol Med Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36004474 PMCID: PMC9437965					Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic; DNA; Glutathione; Lipids; Liver; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Zebrafish; binaprofen; liver injury; mitochondria signaling pathway

Paternal hypoxia exposure primes offspring for increased hypoxia resistance	BMC biology		1741-7007	10.1186/s12915-022-01389-x		BACKGROUND: In a time of rapid environmental change, understanding how the challenges experienced by one generation can influence the fitness of future generations is critically needed. Using tolerance assays and transcriptomic and methylome approaches, we use zebrafish as a model to investigate cross-generational acclimation to hypoxia. RESULTS: We show that short-term paternal exposure to hypoxia endows offspring with greater tolerance to acute hypoxia. We detected two hemoglobin genes that are significantly upregulated by more than 6-fold in the offspring of hypoxia exposed males. Moreover, the offspring which maintained equilibrium the longest showed greatest upregulation in hemoglobin expression. We did not detect differential methylation at any of the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for alterations in gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that an epigenetic memory of past hypoxia exposure is maintained and that this environmentally induced information is transferred to subsequent generations, pre-acclimating progeny to cope with hypoxic conditions.	2022-08-30	2024-03-06 20:18:38	2024-03-06T20:18:38Z		185		1	20		BMC Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36038899 PMCID: PMC9426223					Acclimatization; Animals; Cross-generational; DNA methylation; Danio rerio; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetic; Humans; Hypoxia; Intergenerational; Male; Paternal Exposure; Transcriptomics; Transgenerational acclimation; Transgenerational plasticity; Zebrafish

In this study, we aim at defining the main molecular pathways impacted by IR and how these effects can translate to higher organizational levels such as behavior. Adult zebrafish were exposed to gamma radiation for 36 days at 0.05 mGy/h, 0.5 mGy/h and 5 mGy/h. RNA sequencing was performed on the telencephalon and completed by RNA in situ hybridization that confirmed the upregulation of oxytocin and cone rod homeobox in the parvocellular preoptic nucleus. A dose rate-dependent increase in differentially expressed genes (DEG) was observed with 27 DEG at 0.05 mGy/h, 200 DEG at 0.5 mGy/h and 530 DEG at 5 mGy/h. Genes involved in neurotransmission, neurohormones and hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis functions were specifically affected, strongly suggesting their involvement in the stress response behavior observed after exposure to dose rates superior or equal to 0.5 mGy/h. At the individual scale, hypolocomotion, increased freezing and social stress were detected. Together, these data highlight the intricate interaction between neurohormones (and particularly oxytocin), neurotransmission and neurogenesis in response to chronic exposure to IR and the establishment of anxiety-like behavior.	2022-08-04	2024-03-06 20:18:37	2024-03-06T20:18:37Z		3793		15	14		Cancers (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35954455 PMCID: PMC9367516					anxiety-like behavior; gamma irradiation; neurohormone; neurotransmitter system; sociability; teleost

Elucidating key aspects of zebrafish lymphocyte development and exploring the breadth of effector functions would provide valuable insight into the evolution of adaptive immunity. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ∼70,000 cells from the zebrafish marrow and thymus to establish a gene expression map of zebrafish immune cell development. We uncovered rich cellular diversity in the juvenile and adult zebrafish thymus, elucidated B- and T-cell developmental trajectories, and transcriptionally characterized subsets of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and early thymic progenitors. Our analysis permitted the identification of two dendritic-like cell populations and provided evidence in support of the existence of a pre-B cell state. Our results provide critical insights into the landscape of zebrafish immunology and offer a foundation for cellular and genetic studies.	2022-09-05	2024-03-06 20:18:37	2024-03-06T20:18:37Z		e20220038		9	219		J Exp Med								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35938989 PMCID: PMC9365674					Animals; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid; Single-Cell Analysis; Thymus Gland; Zebrafish

Here, we explore the impact of deriving zebrafish embryos in the absence of microbes on early neural development as well as investigate whether any potential changes can be rescued with treatment of metabolites derived from the zebrafish gut microbiota. RESULTS: Overall, we did not observe any gross morphological changes between treatments but did observe a significant decrease in neural gene expression in embryos raised germ-free, which was rescued with the addition of zebrafish metabolites. Specifically, we identified 354 genes significantly downregulated in germ-free embryos compared to conventionally raised embryos via RNA-Seq analysis. Of these, 42 were rescued with a single treatment of zebrafish gut-derived metabolites to germ-free embryos. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes are involved in prominent neurodevelopmental pathways including transcriptional regulation and Wnt signaling. Consistent with the ontology analysis, we found alterations in the development of Wnt dependent events which was rescued in the germ-free embryos treated with metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that gut-derived metabolites are in part responsible for regulating critical signaling pathways in the brain, especially during neural development.

The current understanding of the molecular mechanism behind cardiovascular development is insufficient and requires further research. RESULTS: Transcriptome sequencing of three developmental stages in zebrafish embryos was performed and revealed three key cardiovascular developmental stages. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in cardiovascular development were screened out. The three developmental stages were 18 (T1), 24 (T2), and 42 h post fertilization (hpf) (T3), and the three stages were confirmed by detecting differences in expression between cardiomyocyte and endothelial marker genes (cmlc2, fli1) using in situ hybridization, which represents the characteristics of cardiovascular development. Thousands of DEGs were identified using transcriptome analysis. Of them, 2605 DEGs were in T1-vs-T2, including 2003 up-regulated and 602 down-regulated genes, 6446 DEGs were in T1-vs-T3, consisting of 4608 up-regulated and 1838 down-regulated genes, and 3275 DEGs were in T2-vs-T3, including 2420 up-regulated and 855 down-regulated genes. There were 644 common DEGs and 167 common five-fold higher differentially expressed genes (HDEGs) identified, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Significant differences was observed in the levels of gene expression among different developmental stages in multiple GO terms and KEGG pathways, such as cell migration to the midline involved in heart development, cardiovascular system development, circulatory system process for biological processes of GO terms; and cardiac muscle contraction, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes for KEGG pathways. These results demonstrated that these three stages were important period for the development of the cardiovascular system. Lastly, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to validate the reliability of RNA-sequencing by selecting 21 DEGs. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that these three stages represented the important periods for cardiovascular system development of zebrafish and some candidate genes was obtained and provided a solid foundation for additional functional studies of the DEGs.	2022-08-13	2024-03-06 20:18:37	2024-03-06T20:18:37Z		587		1	23		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35964013 PMCID: PMC9375324					Animals; Biological Phenomena; Cardiovascular system; Differentially expressed genes; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Reproducibility of Results; Transcriptome; Transcriptome analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish embryos

This study identified an aars1cq71/cq71 mutant zebrafish allele that showed increased neuronal apoptosis and compromised neurogenesis. aars1 transcripts were highly expressed in primary neural progenitor cells, and their aberration resulted in protein overloading and activated Perk. nfe2l2b, a paralog of mammalian Nfe2l2, which encodes Nrf2, is a pivotal executor of Perk signaling that regulates neuronal phenotypes in aars1cq71/cq71 mutants. Interference of nfe2l2b in nfe2l2bΔ1/Δ1 mutants did not affect global larval development. However, aars1cq71/cq71;nfe2l2bΔ1/Δ1 mutant embryos exhibited increased neuronal cell survival and neurogenesis compared with their aars1cq71/cq71 siblings. nfe2l2b was harnessed by Perk at two levels. Its transcript was regulated by Chop, an implementer of Perk. It was also phosphorylated by Perk. Both pathways synergistically assured the nuclear functions of nfe2l2b to control cell survival by targeting p53. Our study extends the understanding of tRNA synthetase in neurogenesis and implies that Nrf2 is a cue to mitigate neurodegenerative pathogenesis.	2022-09-01	2024-03-06 20:18:36	2024-03-06T20:18:36Z		dev200342		17	149		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35929539					Aars1; Alanine-tRNA Ligase; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Survival; Mammals; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Neuronal apoptosis; Nrf2; Perk; UPR; Zebrafish

Leptin mutation and mycobacterial infection lead non-synergistically to a similar metabolic syndrome	Metabolomics: Official Journal of the Metabolomic Society		1573-3890	10.1007/s11306-022-01921-8		INTRODUCTION: The leptin signaling pathway plays an important role as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, metabolism control and systemic inflammatory responses. However, the metabolic effects of leptin on infectious diseases, for example tuberculosis (TB), are still little known. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aim to investigate the role of leptin on metabolism in the absence and presence of mycobacterial infection in zebrafish larvae and mice. METHODS: Metabolites in entire zebrafish larvae and the blood of mice were studied using high-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, respectively. For transcriptome studies of zebrafish larvae, deep RNA sequencing was used. RESULTS: The results show that leptin mutation leads to a similar metabolic syndrome as caused by mycobacterial infection in the two species, characterized by the decrease of 11 amine metabolites. In both species, this metabolic syndrome was not aggravated further when the leptin mutant was infected by mycobacteria. Therefore, we conclude that leptin and mycobacterial infection are both impacting metabolism non-synergistically. In addition, we studied the transcriptomes of lepbibl54 mutant zebrafish larvae and wild type (WT) siblings after mycobacterial infection. These studies showed that mycobacteria induced a very distinct transcriptome signature in the lepbibl54 mutant zebrafish compared to WT sibling control larvae. Furthermore, lepbibl55 Tg (pck1:luc1) zebrafish line was constructed and confirmed this difference in transcriptional responses. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin mutation and TB lead non-synergistically to a similar metabolic syndrome. Moreover, different transcriptomic responses in the lepbibl54  mutant and TB can lead to the similar metabolic end states.	2022-08-07	2024-03-06 20:18:36	2024-03-06T20:18:36Z		67		8	18		Metabolomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35933481 PMCID: PMC9356939					Animals; Larva; Leptin; Leptin mutant zebrafish; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Metabolomics; Mice; Mutation; Non-synergy; Ob/ob mice; Transcriptomics; Tuberculosis; Zebrafish

Despite extensive efforts to characterize the cellular heterogeneity of different organisms, cross-species comparisons of landscape dynamics have not been achieved. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map organism-level cell landscapes at multiple life stages for mice, zebrafish and Drosophila. By integrating the comprehensive dataset of > 2.6 million single cells, we constructed a cross-species cell landscape and identified signatures and common pathways that changed throughout the life span. We identified structural inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction as the most common hallmarks of organism aging, and found that pharmacological activation of mitochondrial metabolism alleviated aging phenotypes in mice. The cross-species cell landscape with other published datasets were stored in an integrated online portal-Cell Landscape.

Several studies have shown that the individual ELMO proteins are involved in a variety of cellular and developmental processes. However, it has poorly been understood whether the Elmo proteins show similar functions and act redundantly. To address this question, elmo1 -/- , elmo2 -/- and elmo3 -/- zebrafish were generated and a comprehensive comparison of the phenotypic changes in organ morphology, transcriptome and metabolome was performed in these mutants. The results showed decreased fasting and increased postprandial blood glucose levels in adult elmo1 -/- , as well as a decreased vascular formation in the adult retina in elmo1 -/- , but an increased vascular formation in the adult elmo3 -/- retina. The phenotypical comparison provided few similarities, as increased Bowman space areas in adult elmo1 -/- and elmo2 -/- kidneys, an increased hyaloid vessel diameter in elmo1 -/- and elmo3 -/- and a transcriptional downregulation of the vascular development in elmo1 -/- , elmo2 -/- , and elmo3 -/- zebrafish larvae. Besides this, elmo1 -/- , elmo2 -/- , and elmo3 -/- zebrafish exhibited several distinct changes in the vascular and glomerular structure and in the metabolome and the transcriptome. Especially, elmo3 -/- zebrafish showed extensive differences in the larval transcriptome and an impaired survivability. Together, the data demonstrated that the three zebrafish Elmo proteins regulate not only similar but also divergent biological processes and mechanisms and show a low functional redundancy.	2022	2024-03-06 20:18:35	2024-03-06T20:18:35Z		918529			10		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35874819 PMCID: PMC9304559					ELMO1; ELMO2; ELMO3; Elmo protein family; vasculature; zebrafish

MITF deficiency and oncogenic GNAQ each promote proliferation programs in zebrafish melanocyte lineage cells	Pigment Cell & Melanoma Research		1755-148X	10.1111/pcmr.13057		Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary malignancy of the adult eye but lacks any FDA-approved therapy for the deadly metastatic disease. Thus, there is a great need to dissect the driving mechanisms for UM and develop strategies to evaluate potential therapeutics. Using an autochthonous zebrafish model, we previously identified MITF, the master melanocyte transcription factor, as a tumor suppressor in GNAQQ209L -driven UM. Here, we show that zebrafish mitfa-deficient GNAQQ209L -driven tumors significantly up-regulate neural crest markers, and that higher expression of a melanoma-associated neural crest signature correlates with poor UM patient survival. We further determined how the mitfa-null state, as well as expression of GNAQQ209L , YAPS127A;S381A , or BRAFV600E oncogenes, impacts melanocyte lineage cells before they acquire the transformed state. Specifically, examination 5 days post-fertilization showed that mitfa-deficiency is sufficient to up-regulate pigment progenitor and neural crest markers, while GNAQQ209L expression promotes a proliferative phenotype that is further enhanced by YAPS127A;S381A co-expression. Finally, we show that this oncogene-induced proliferative phenotype can be used to screen chemical inhibitors for their efficacy against the UM pathway. Overall, this study establishes that a neural crest signature correlates with poor UM survival, and describes an in vivo assay for preclinical trials of potential UM therapeutics.	2022-09	2024-03-06 20:18:35	2024-03-06T20:18:35Z		539-547		5	35		Pigment Cell Melanoma Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35869673 PMCID: PMC9541221					Animals; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11; MITF; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Mutation; Oncogenes; Uveal Neoplasms; Zebrafish; cell differentiation; drug screening assay; melanocyte; uveal melanoma; zebrafish

However, the composition of the regenerative niche has remained largely elusive. Here, we dissected the diversity of activated cell states in the regenerating zebrafish heart based on single-cell transcriptomics and spatiotemporal analysis. We observed the emergence of several transient cell states with fibroblast characteristics following injury, and we outlined the proregenerative function of collagen-12-expressing fibroblasts. To understand the cascade of events leading to heart regeneration, we determined the origin of these cell states by high-throughput lineage tracing. We found that activated fibroblasts were derived from two separate sources: the epicardium and the endocardium. Mechanistically, we determined Wnt signalling as a regulator of the endocardial fibroblast response. In summary, our work identifies specialized activated fibroblast cell states that contribute to heart regeneration, thereby opening up possible approaches to modulating the regenerative capacity of the vertebrate heart.	2022-08	2024-03-06 20:18:35	2024-03-06T20:18:35Z		1227-1237		8	54		Nat Genet								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35864193 PMCID: PMC7613248					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Fibroblasts; Heart; Myocytes, Cardiac; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body
V6W3UMSN	journalArticle	2020	Kwok, Man Long; Hu, Xue Lei; Meng, Qi; Chan, King Ming	Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of the zebrafish liver cell line, ZFL, after acute exposure to Cu2+ ions	Metallomics		1756-5901, 1756-591X	10.1039/d0mt00005a	https://academic.oup.com/metallomics/article/12/5/732/5961814	Abstract              All cells require Cu as a cofactor, but Cu2+ induces toxicity and oxidative damage. A strict system is thus needed to maintain Cu homeostasis. Using the ZFL zebrafish liver cell line as a model, we studied the cellular responses after exposure to Cu2+, using whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) to screen nearly all transcriptomes in cell samples and identify changes in gene expression. ZFL cells were treated with 100, 200, or 400 μM CuCl2 and harvested after 4 and 24 h. RNA was then extracted and subjected to RNA-Seq and qPCR validation. Exposure to 400 μM CuCl2 for 4 h and 24 h led to the regulation of 5993 and 4235 genes, respectively. In a gene ontology enrichment analysis, Cu2+ exposure enriched the nitrogen compound metabolic process and antioxidant activity but did not significantly affect cellular copper, zinc, iron and calcium ion homeostasis. In a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, anti-oxidative stress induced the glutathione metabolism pathway. Furthermore, Cu2+ also induced genes related to apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle in the G2 phase. This study was based on the full gene expression profile combined with pathway analysis details, providing a full cellular response picture for Cu.	2020-05-01	2024-03-06 20:26:20	2024-03-06T20:26:20Z	2024-03-06 20:26:19	732-751		5	12										en					DOI.org (Crossref)

Extensive nuclear gyration and pervasive non-genic transcription during primordial germ cell development in zebrafish				10.1101/2020.01.10.901306	http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.01.10.901306	SUMMARY            Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the precursors of germ cells, which migrate to the genital ridge during early development. Relatively little is known about PGCs after their migration. We studied this post-migratory stage using microscopy and sequencing techniques, and found that many PGC-specific genes, including genes known to induce PGC fate in the mouse, are only activated several days after migration. At this same timepoint, PGC nuclei become extremely gyrated, displaying general opening of chromatin and high levels of transcription. This is accompanied by changes in nuage morphology, expression of large loci, named PERLs, enriched for retro-transposons and piRNAs, and a rise in piRNA biogenesis signatures. Interestingly, no nuclear Piwi protein could be detected at any timepoint, indicating that the zebrafish piRNA pathway is fully cytoplasmic. Our data show that the post-migratory stage of zebrafish PGCs holds many cues to both germ cell fate establishment and piRNA pathway activation.	2020-01-10	2024-03-06 20:26:20	2024-03-06T20:26:20Z	2024-03-06 20:26:19												Developmental Biology		en		preprint			DOI.org (Crossref)		DOI: 10.1101/2020.01.10.901306

This raises three key questions. First, do MG reprogram to a developmental retinal progenitor cell (RPC) state? Second, to what extent does regeneration recapitulate retinal development? And finally, does loss of different retinal cell subtypes induce unique MG regeneration responses? We examined these questions by performing single-nuclear and single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq in both developing and regenerating retinas. Here we show that injury induces MG to reprogram to a state similar to late-stage RPCs. However, there are major transcriptional differences between MGPCs and RPCs, as well as major transcriptional differences between activated MG and MGPCs when different retinal cell subtypes are damaged. Validation of candidate genes confirmed that loss of different subtypes induces differences in transcription factor gene expression and regeneration outcomes.	2023-12-20	2024-03-06 20:21:04	2024-03-06T20:21:04Z		8477		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38123561 PMCID: PMC10733277					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Ependymoglial Cells; Gene Regulatory Networks; Neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Retina; Zebrafish

We utilize high throughput sequencing (RNA-sequencing) to characterize the neurotranscriptome profiles in both males and females across four strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Strains varied by previously documented differences in stress and anxiety-like behavioral responses, and generations removed from wild-caught individuals.

Over 50% of diabetic patients will develop DPN, characterized by motor dysfunction and impaired sensory nerve function. In a previous study, we have uncovered acrolein (ACR) as an upstream initiator which induced impaired glucose homeostasis and microvascular alterations in zebrafish. Whether ACR has specific effects on peripheral neurogenesis and mediates DPN, is still waiting for clarification. METHODS: To evaluate the function of ACR in peripheral nerve development, in vivo experiments were performed in Tg(hb9:GFP) zebrafish. In addition, a series of rescue experiments, metabolomics assessment, and bioinformatics analysis was performed aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms behind ACR's function and impaired neurogenesis. RESULTS: Impaired motor neuron development was confirmed in wild-type embryos treated with external ACR. ACR treated embryos displayed ferroptosis and reduction of several amino acids and increased glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, ferroptosis inducer caused similarly suppressed neurogenesis in zebrafish embryos, while anti-ACR treatment or ferroptosis inhibitor could successfully reverse the detrimental phenotypes of ACR on neurogenesis in zebrafish. DISCUSSION: Our data indicate that ACR could directly activate ferroptosis and impairs peripheral neurogenesis. The data strongly suggest ACR and activated ferroptosis as inducers and promising therapeutic targets for future DPN studies.	2022	2024-03-06 20:21:03	2024-03-06T20:21:03Z		1044213			16		Front Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36711148 PMCID: PMC9877442					acrolein; diabetic peripheral neuropathy; ferroptosis; neurodegeneration; neurogenesis																																																																																																																																				
2TBUTNXQ	journalArticle	2021	Elbialy, Abdalla	Ageing genetic signature of hypersomatotropism	Open Biology		2046-2441	10.1098/rsob.200265		Acromegaly is a pathological condition that is caused by over-secretion of growth hormone (GH) and develops primarily from a pituitary adenoma. Excess GH exposure over a prolonged period of time leads to a wide range of systemic manifestations and comorbidities. Studying the effect of excess GH on the cellular level could help to understand the underlying causes of acromegaly health complications and comorbidities. In our previous publications, we have shown that excess GH reduces body side population (SP) stem cells and induces signs of premature ageing in an acromegaly zebrafish model. Here, we study acromegaly ageing in greater depth at the level of gene expression. We investigated whether acromegaly induces an ageing genetic signature in different organs. Using the GenAge database, our acromegaly model showed a significant enrichment of ageing genetic datasets in the muscle but not in other organs. Likewise, the hierarchical clustering of wild type (WT), acromegaly and aged RNA data from various organs revealed the similarity of gene expression profiles between the acromegaly and the aged muscles. We therefore identified overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different organs between acromegaly and aged zebrafish. Importantly, about half of the muscle, liver and brain acromegaly DEGs overlapped with aged zebrafish DEGs. Interestingly, overlapping was observed in the same way; acromegaly-up DEGs overlapped with aged zebrafish up DEGs, not down DEGs, and vice versa. We then identified the biological functions of overlapping DEGs. Enrichment database analysis and gene ontology showed that most overlapping muscle genes were involved in ageing metabolism, while overlapping liver DEGs were involved in metabolic pathways, response to hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, this study provides a full ageing genetic signature of acromegaly at the gene expression level.	2021-04	2024-03-06 20:21:03	2024-03-06T20:21:03Z		200265		4	11		Open Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33849304 PMCID: PMC8059514					Acromegaly; Aging; Animals; Biomarkers; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Susceptibility; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Organ Specificity; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; acromegaly; ageing signature; growth hormone; zebrafish

Onset of transcription is followed by cellular and morphological changes involving cell speciation and gastrulation. Previous genome-wide surveys of transcriptional changes only assessed gene expression levels; however, recent studies have shown the necessity to map isoform-specific transcriptional changes. Here, we perform isoform discovery and quantification on transcriptome sequences from before and after zebrafish zygotic genome activation (ZGA). RESULTS: We identify novel isoforms and isoform switches during ZGA for genes related to cell adhesion, pluripotency and DNA methylation. Isoform switching events include alternative splicing and changes in transcriptional start sites and in 3' untranslated regions. New isoforms are identified even for well-characterized genes such as pou5f1, sall4 and dnmt1. Genes involved in cell-cell interactions such as f11r and magi1 display isoform switches with alterations of coding sequences. We also detect over 1000 transcripts that acquire a longer 3' terminal exon when transcribed by the zygote compared to their maternal transcript counterparts. ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The novel isoforms and isoform switches reported here include regulators of transcriptional, cellular and morphological changes taking place around ZGA. Our data display an array of isoform-related functional changes and represent a valuable resource complementary to existing early embryo transcriptomes.	2013-05-15	2024-03-06 20:21:03	2024-03-06T20:21:03Z		331			14		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23676078 PMCID: PMC3747860					3' Untranslated Regions; Alternative Splicing; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Epigenesis, Genetic; Exons; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Markers; Genome; Histones; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Molecular Sequence Data; Mothers; RNA Isoforms; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription Initiation Site; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; Zygote

A targeted CRISPR-Cas9 mediated F0 screen identifies genes involved in establishment of the enteric nervous system	bioRxiv: The Preprint Server for Biology			10.1101/2023.12.28.573581		The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) is a crucial network of enteric neurons and glia resident within the entire gastrointestinal tract (GI). Overseeing essential GI functions such as gut motility and water balance, the ENS serves as a pivotal bidirectional link in the gut-brain axis. During early development, the ENS is primarily derived from enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Disruptions to ENCC development, as seen in conditions like Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), lead to absence of ENS in the GI, particularly in the colon. In this study, using zebrafish, we devised an in vivo F0 CRISPR-based screen employing a robust, rapid pipeline integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR reverse genetics, and high-content imaging. Our findings unveil various genes, including those encoding for opioid receptors, as possible regulators of ENS establishment. In addition, we present evidence that suggests opioid receptor involvement in neurochemical coding of the larval ENS. In summary, our work presents a novel, efficient CRISPR screen targeting ENS development, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown genes, and increasing knowledge of nervous system construction.	2023-12-29	2024-03-06 20:21:03	2024-03-06T20:21:03Z		2023.12.28.573581					bioRxiv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38234831 PMCID: PMC10793464					CRISPR screen; enteric nervous system; enteric nervous system development; enteric neuron; opioid; zebrafish

C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients. Thus, the C1q-ApoE complex is a new pathological hallmark of viral hepatitis B and C and NAFLD.	2022	2024-03-06 20:21:02	2024-03-06T20:21:02Z		970938			13		Front Immunol	The C1q-ApoE complex							eng					PubMed		PMID: 36304458 PMCID: PMC9592549					Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Atherosclerosis; C1q-ApoE complex; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Complement C1q; Hepatitis, Viral, Human; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; classical complement cascade (CCC); hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); viral hepatitis

Variable paralog expression underlies phenotype variation	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.79247		Human faces are variable; we look different from one another. Craniofacial disorders further increase facial variation. To understand craniofacial variation and how it can be buffered, we analyzed the zebrafish mef2ca mutant. When this transcription factor encoding gene is mutated, zebrafish develop dramatically variable craniofacial phenotypes. Years of selective breeding for low and high penetrance of mutant phenotypes produced strains that are either resilient or sensitive to the mef2ca mutation. Here, we compared gene expression between these strains, which revealed that selective breeding enriched for high and low mef2ca paralog expression in the low- and high-penetrance strains, respectively. We found that mef2ca paralog expression is variable in unselected wild-type zebrafish, motivating the hypothesis that heritable variation in paralog expression underlies mutant phenotype severity and variation. In support, mutagenizing the mef2ca paralogs, mef2aa, mef2b, mef2cb, and mef2d demonstrated modular buffering by paralogs. Specifically, some paralogs buffer severity while others buffer variability. We present a novel, mechanistic model for phenotypic variation where variable, vestigial paralog expression buffers development. These studies are a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms of facial variation, including how some genetically resilient individuals can overcome a deleterious mutation.	2022-09-22	2024-03-06 20:21:02	2024-03-06T20:21:02Z		e79247			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36134886 PMCID: PMC9555865					Animals; Biological Variation, Population; Humans; MEF2 Transcription Factors; Phenotype; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; compensation; craniofacial development; developmental biology; developmental buffering; gene duplication; genetics; genomics; paralogs; robustness; subfunctionalization; variability; vestigial expression; zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
LV3PUNY3	journalArticle	2022	Li, Jing; Wen, Wenjun; Zhang, Shuqiang; Zhou, Chune; Feng, Yiyi; Li, Xiaoyu	The Expression and Function of lincRNA-154324 and the Adjoining Protein-Coding Gene vmp1 in the Caudal Fin Regeneration of Zebrafish	International Journal of Molecular Sciences		1422-0067	10.3390/ijms23168944		Caudal fin regeneration is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, but the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has rarely been studied. The present study aimed to describe the landscape of lncRNAs during caudal fin regeneration using whole transcriptome sequencing, and then to conduct a functional study on the target lncRNAs using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, and the CRISPR/Cas9 method for lncRNA gene knockout. The results of the transcriptome sequencing showed that a total of 381 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, among which ENSDART00000154324 (lincRNA-154324) was found to be highly related to caudal fin regeneration, and thus it was chosen as the target lncRNA for the subsequent functional study. The results regarding the temporal and spatial expression of lincRNA-154324 and the gene knockout results from CRISPR/Cas9 indicated that lincRNA-154324 is involved in the caudal fin regeneration of zebrafish. Importantly, we serendipitously discovered that the cis correlation coefficient between lincRNA-154324 and its neighboring gene vacuole membrane protein 1 (vmp1) is extremely high, and they are essential for the process of caudal fin regeneration. Moreover, studies have found that vmp1 plays an important role in protein secretion, organelle formation, multicellular development, and autophagy. Collectively, our result may provide a framework for the identification and analysis of lncRNAs involved in the regeneration of the zebrafish caudal fin.	2022-08-11	2024-03-06 20:21:02	2024-03-06T20:21:02Z		8944		16	23		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 36012210 PMCID: PMC9409064					Animals; In Situ Hybridization; RNA, Long Noncoding; Wound Healing; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; caudal fin; lncRNA; regeneration; vmp1; zebrafish

Insight into 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced disruption of zebrafish spermatogenesis via single cell RNA-seq	PNAS nexus		2752-6542	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac060		2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent and environmentally persistent endocrine disrupting chemical. Our previous work demonstrated the latent reproductive maladies of early-life TCDD exposure in zebrafish. Zebrafish acutely exposed to low, environmentally relevant levels of TCDD (50 pg/mL) during two windows of sexual differentiation in development (1 hour of exposure at 3 and 7 weeks postfertilization) were later infertile, showed a reduction in sperm, and exhibited gene expression consistent with an altered microenvironment, even months after exposure. Due to the highly heterogeneous cell- type and -stage landscape of the testes, we hypothesized various cell types contribute markedly different profiles toward the pathology of TCDD exposure. To investigate the contributions of the diverse cell types in the adult zebrafish testes to TCDD-induced pathology, we utilized single-cell RNA-seq and the 10x Genomics platform. The method successfully captured every stage of testicular germ cell development. Testes of adult fish exposed during sexual differentiation to TCDD contained sharply decreased populations of late spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. Spermatogonia and early spermatocyte populations were, in contrast, enriched following exposure. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes supported previous findings that TCDD exposure resulted in male infertility, and suggested this outcome is due to apoptosis of spermatids and spermatozoa, even years after exposure cessation. Increased germ cell apoptosis was confirmed histologically. These results provide support for an environmental exposure explanation of idiopathic male infertility.	2022-07	2024-03-06 20:21:01	2024-03-06T20:21:01Z		pgac060		3	1		PNAS Nexus								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35799832 PMCID: PMC9252172					2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; scRNA-seq; spermatogenesis; testes; zebrafish

Pivotal for the regenerative capacity of the zebrafish brain at adult stages is the precise control of neural stem cell (NSC) behavior and the maintenance of the stem cell pool. The gene mdka, a member of a small family of heparin binding growth factors, was previously shown to be involved in regeneration in the zebrafish retina, heart, and fin. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of the gene mdka and its paralogue mdkb in the zebrafish adult telencephalon under constitutive and regenerative conditions. Our findings show that only mdka expression is specifically restricted to the telencephalic ventricle, a stem cell niche of the zebrafish telencephalon. In this brain region, mdka is particularly expressed in the quiescent stem cells. Interestingly, after brain injury, mdka expression remains restricted to the resting stem cell, which might suggest a role of mdka in regulating stem cell quiescence.	2022-02-18	2024-03-06 20:21:01	2024-03-06T20:21:01Z		284		2	12		Brain Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35204047 PMCID: PMC8870249					adult neurogenesis; mdka; neural stem cell; quiescence; radial glial cell; regeneration; telencephalon; zebrafish

The exact mechanism resulting in these neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive, but C9 repeat RNA toxicity has been implicated as a gain-of-function mechanism. Our aim was to use a zebrafish model for C9orf72 RNA toxicity to identify modifiers of the ALS-linked phenotype. We discovered that the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) reverses the toxicity of both sense and antisense repeat RNA, which is dependent on its subcellular localization and RNA recognition, and not on C9orf72 repeat RNA binding. We observed HNRNPK cytoplasmic mislocalization in C9orf72 ALS patient fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and post-mortem motor cortex and spinal cord, in line with a disrupted HNRNPK function in C9orf72 ALS. In C9orf72 ALS/FTD patient tissue, we discovered an increased nuclear translocation, but reduced expression of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a downstream target of HNRNPK involved in the DNA damage response. Last but not least, we showed that increasing the expression of HNRNPK or RRM2 was sufficient to mitigate DNA damage in our C9orf72 RNA toxicity zebrafish model. Overall, our study strengthens the relevance of RNA toxicity as a pathogenic mechanism in C9orf72 ALS and demonstrates its link with an aberrant DNA damage response, opening novel therapeutic avenues for C9orf72 ALS/FTD.	2022-09	2024-03-06 20:21:01	2024-03-06T20:21:01Z		465-488		3	144		Acta Neuropathol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35895140 PMCID: PMC9381635					ALS; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; C9orf72; C9orf72 Protein; DNA Damage; DNA Repeat Expansion; DNA damage; Frontotemporal Dementia; HNRNPK; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K; Pick Disease of the Brain; RNA; RNA toxicity; RNA, Antisense; RRM2; Zebrafish

Indeed, in response to tissue injury and the ensuing regeneration process, macrophages are challenged and undergo massive metabolic adaptations and changes. However, the control of this metabolic reprogramming by macrophage microenvironment has never been deciphered in vivo. Methods: In this study, we used zebrafish model and caudal fin resection as a robust regeneration system. We explored specific changes in gene expression after tissue amputation via single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and whole-tissue transcriptomic analysis. Based on the identification of key modifications, we confirmed the role of the lactate pathway in macrophage response and fin regeneration, through the combination of chemical and genetic inhibitors of this pathway. Results: Single cell RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of different genes associated with glycolysis and lactate metabolism in macrophages, upon fin regeneration. Hence, using chemical inhibitors of the LDH enzyme, we confirmed the role of lactate in macrophage recruitment and polarization, to promote a pro-inflammatory phenotype and enhance fin regeneration. The genetic modulation of monocarboxylate transporters illustrated a complex regulation of lactate levels, based on both intracellular and extracellular supplies. Commonly, the different sources of lactate resulted in macrophage activation with an increased expression level of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa during the first 24 hours of regeneration. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed that lactate induced a global modification of gene expression in macrophages. Conclusion: Altogether, our findings highlight the crucial role of lactate at the onset of macrophage differentiation toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. The deep modifications of macrophage phenotype mediated by lactate and downstream effectors play a key role to coordinate inflammatory response and tissue regeneration.	2022	2024-03-06 20:21:01	2024-03-06T20:21:01Z		3995-4009		8	12		Theranostics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35664055 PMCID: PMC9131269					Animals; Cytokines; Lactates; Macrophages; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; lactate; macrophage; single cell RNA-sequencing; zebrafish

Here, we systematically investigate the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of TEs across 11 adult zebrafish tissues using multidimensional sequencing data. We find that TEs contribute substantially to a diverse array of regulatory elements in the zebrafish genome and that 37% of TEs are positioned in active regulatory states in adult zebrafish tissues. We identify TE subfamilies enriched in highly specific regulatory elements among different tissues. We use transcript assembly to discover TE-derived transcriptional units expressed across tissues. Finally, we show that novel TE-derived promoters can initiate tissue-specific transcription of alternate gene isoforms. This work provides a comprehensive profile of TE activity across normal zebrafish tissues, shedding light on mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression in this widely used model organism.	2022-07	2024-03-06 20:21:01	2024-03-06T20:21:01Z		1424-1436		7	32		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35649578 PMCID: PMC9341505					Animals; DNA Transposable Elements; Epigenomics; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Zebrafish

Immunoglobulin superfamily receptor Junctional adhesion molecule 3 (Jam3) requirement for melanophore survival and patterning during formation of zebrafish stripes	Developmental Biology		1095-564X	10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.04.007		Adhesive interactions are essential for tissue patterning and morphogenesis yet difficult to study owing to functional redundancies across genes and gene families. A useful system in which to dissect roles for cell adhesion and adhesion-dependent signaling is the pattern formed by pigment cells in skin of adult zebrafish, in which stripes represent the arrangement of neural crest derived melanophores, cells homologous to melanocytes. In a forward genetic screen for adult pattern defects, we isolated the pissarro (psr) mutant, having a variegated phenotype of spots, as well as defects in adult fin and lens. We show that psr corresponds to junctional adhesion protein 3b (jam3b) encoding a zebrafish orthologue of the two immunoglobulin-like domain receptor JAM3 (JAM-C), known for roles in adhesion and signaling in other developing tissues, and for promoting metastatic behavior of human and murine melanoma cells. We found that zebrafish jam3b is expressed post-embryonically in a variety of cells including melanophores, and that jam3b mutants have defects in melanophore survival. Jam3b supported aggregation of cells in vitro and was required autonomously by melanophores for an adherent phenotype in vivo. Genetic analyses further indicated both overlapping and non-overlapping functions with the related receptor, Immunoglobulin superfamily 11 (Igsf11) and Kit receptor tyrosine kinase. These findings suggest a model for Jam3b function in zebrafish melanophores and hint at the complexity of adhesive interactions underlying pattern formation.	2021-08	2024-03-06 20:21:00	2024-03-06T20:21:00Z		314-327			476		Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 33933422 PMCID: PMC10069301					Animals; Body Patterning; Carrier Proteins; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell adhesion; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Immunoglobulins; Iridophore; JAM3; Junctional Adhesion Molecule C; Melanophore; Melanophores; Metamorphosis, Biological; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Neural Crest; Phenotype; Pigment pattern; Pigmentation; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Here, we describe a tissue-specific biotin ChIP-seq protocol for zebrafish and chicken embryos which utilizes AVI tagging of TFs, permitting their biotinylation by a co-expressed nuclear biotin ligase. Subsequently, biotinylated factors can be precipitated with streptavidin beads, enabling the user to construct TF genome-wide binding landscapes like conventional ChIP-seq methods.

Thomas	suz12 inactivation in p53- and nf1-deficient zebrafish accelerates the onset of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and expands the spectrum of tumor types	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.042341		Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression that possesses histone methyltransferase activity. PRC2 trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 proteins (H3K27me3) as a chromatin modification associated with repressed transcription of genes frequently involved in cell proliferation or self-renewal. Loss-of-function mutations in the PRC2 core subunit SUZ12 have been identified in a variety of tumors, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). To determine the consequences of SUZ12 loss in the pathogenesis of MPNST and other cancers, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the open reading frame of each of two orthologous suz12 genes in zebrafish: suz12a and suz12b We generated these knockout alleles in the germline of our previously described p53 (also known as tp53)- and nf1-deficient zebrafish model of MPNSTs. Loss of suz12 significantly accelerated the onset and increased the penetrance of MPNSTs compared to that in control zebrafish. Moreover, in suz12-deficient zebrafish, we detected additional types of tumors besides MPNSTs, including leukemia with histological characteristics of lymphoid malignancies, soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which were not detected in p53/nf1-deficient control fish, and are also contained in the human spectrum of SUZ12-deficient malignancies identified in the AACR Genie database. The suz12-knockout tumors displayed reduced or abolished H3K27me3 epigenetic marks and upregulation of gene sets reported to be targeted by PRC2. Thus, these zebrafish lines with inactivation of suz12 in combination with loss of p53/nf1 provide a model of human MPNSTs and multiple other tumor types, which will be useful for mechanistic studies of molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors.	2020-08-27	2024-03-06 20:20:59	2024-03-06T20:20:59Z		dmm042341		8	13		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32651197 PMCID: PMC7473648					Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA Methylation; Disease Models, Animal; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Leukemia; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases; MPNST; NF1; Neurofibromin 1; Neurofibrosarcoma; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RAS signaling; SUZ12; Sarcoma; Signal Transduction; Soft Tissue Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; p53

Wnt pathway mutants are often classified as PCP mutants due to similarities between their phenotypes. Here, we show that in the zebrafish lateral line, disruptions of the PCP and Wnt pathways have differential effects on hair cell orientations. While mutations in the PCP genes vangl2 and scrib cause random orientations of hair cells, mutations in wnt11f1, gpc4 and fzd7a/b induce hair cells to adopt a concentric pattern. This concentric pattern is not caused by defects in PCP but is due to misaligned support cells. The molecular basis of the support cell defect is unknown but we demonstrate that the PCP and Wnt pathways work in parallel to establish proper hair cell orientation. Consequently, hair cell orientation defects are not solely explained by defects in PCP signaling, and some hair cell phenotypes warrant re-evaluation.	2019-09-05	2024-03-06 20:20:59	2024-03-06T20:20:59Z		3993		1	10		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31488837 PMCID: PMC6728366					Animals; Cell Polarity; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Hair Cells, Auditory; Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans; Membrane Proteins; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Neural Tube Defects; Neurulation; Receptors, Cell Surface; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Wnt1 Protein; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Diets enriched in omega-6 and deficient in omega-3 PUFAs (low dietary omega-3/omega-6 PUFA ratio), have been associated with the promotion of pathogenesis of diseases in humans and other mammals. In this study, we investigated the impact of increased dietary intake of arachidonic acid (ARA), a physiologically important omega-6 PUFA, on 2 generations of zebrafish. Parental fish were fed either a low or a high ARA diet, while the progeny of both groups were fed the low ARA diet. We screened for DNA methylation on single base-pair resolution using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The DNA methylation profiling revealed significant differences between the dietary groups in both parents and offspring. The majority of differentially methylated loci associated with high dietary ARA were found in introns and intergenic regions for both generations. Common loci between the identified differentially methylated loci in F0 and F1 livers were reported. We described overlapping gene annotations of identified methylation changes with differential expression, but based on a small number of overlaps. The present study describes the diet-associated methylation profiles across genomic regions, and it demonstrates that parental high dietary ARA modulates DNA methylation patterns in zebrafish liver.	2019	2024-03-06 20:20:59	2024-03-06T20:20:59Z		e0220934		8	14		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 31398226 PMCID: PMC6688801					Animals; Arachidonic Acid; Body Weight; Cluster Analysis; DNA Methylation; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Loci; Genome; Liver; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Zebrafish

Biological clock function is linked to proactive and reactive personality types	BMC biology		1741-7007	10.1186/s12915-018-0618-0		BACKGROUND: Many physiological processes in our body are controlled by the biological clock and show circadian rhythmicity. It is generally accepted that a robust rhythm is a prerequisite for optimal functioning and that a lack of rhythmicity can contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases. Here, we tested in a heterogeneous laboratory zebrafish population whether and how variation in the rhythmicity of the biological clock is associated with the coping styles of individual animals, as assessed in a behavioural assay to reliably measure this along a continuum between proactive and reactive extremes. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing on brain samples, we demonstrated a prominent difference in the expression level of genes involved in the biological clock between proactive and reactive individuals. Subsequently, we tested whether this correlation between gene expression and coping style was due to a consistent change in the level of clock gene expression or to a phase shift or to altered amplitude of the circadian rhythm of gene expression. Our data show a remarkable individual variation in amplitude of the clock gene expression rhythms, which was also reflected in the fluctuating concentrations of melatonin and cortisol, and locomotor activity. This variation in rhythmicity showed a strong correlation with the coping style of the individual, ranging from robust rhythms with large amplitudes in proactive fish to a complete absence of rhythmicity in reactive fish. The rhythmicity of the proactive fish decreased when challenged with constant light conditions whereas the rhythmicity of reactive individuals was not altered. CONCLUSION: These results shed new light on the role of the biological clock by demonstrating that large variation in circadian rhythmicity of individuals may occur within populations. The observed correlation between coping style and circadian rhythmicity suggests that the level of rhythmicity forms an integral part of proactive or reactive coping styles.	2018-12-21	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		148		1	16		BMC Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 30577878 PMCID: PMC6303931					Animals; Behaviour; Biological Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Circadian rhythm; Clock genes; Coping style; Cortisol; Endocrine regulation; Female; Gene Expression; Hydrocortisone; Locomotion; Male; Melatonin; Personality; RNA sequencing; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
IZ94JDJ7	journalArticle	2017	Armant, Olivier; Gombeau, Kewin; Guillermin, Christelle Adam	Whole transcriptome data of zebrafish exposed to chronic dose of depleted uranium	Data in Brief		2352-3409	10.1016/j.dib.2017.07.071		The concentration of depleted uranium (DU) in the environment is expected to increase due to anthropogenic activities, posing potential risks on ecosystems. The effects of chronic exposure to DU at concentration close to the environmental standards (0.3-30 µg DU/L) are scarcely characterised. Genomic alterations caused by low doses of pollutants can potentially propagate over generations, but how these effects may affect the health of the progeny remain uncertain for the vast majority of toxicants. The present dataset describes the transcriptomic effects of a chronic exposure to 20 µg DU/L during 10 days on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) organs, the brain, the testis and the ovaries. The potential multigenerational effects of DU were assessed on the progeny of the adult exposed fish at the two-cells stage and after four days of development. We describe in this article the summary statistics of the differential gene expression analysis and focus on key molecular pathways affected by an exposure to a low concentration of DU. The data presented in this study supports the observation made in Armant et al. (2017) [1] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2016.05.007) that DU can induce a molecular stress in both adult zebrafish and their progeny. The raw dataset has been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under the accession number GEO:GSE96603.	2017-10	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		474-482			14		Data Brief								eng					PubMed		PMID: 28831411 PMCID: PMC5554979					Depleted uranium; Development; Genetics; Multigenerational effects; Zebrafish; mRNASeq																																																																																																																																				
7SJJWFEH	journalArticle	2016	Hu, Yu; Xie, Shuying; Yao, Jihua	Identification of Novel Reference Genes Suitable for qRT-PCR Normalization with Respect to the Zebrafish Developmental Stage	PloS One		1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0149277		Reference genes used in normalizing qRT-PCR data are critical for the accuracy of gene expression analysis. However, many traditional reference genes used in zebrafish early development are not appropriate because of their variable expression levels during embryogenesis. In the present study, we used our previous RNA-Seq dataset to identify novel reference genes suitable for gene expression analysis during zebrafish early developmental stages. We first selected 197 most stably expressed genes from an RNA-Seq dataset (29,291 genes in total), according to the ratio of their maximum to minimum RPKM values. Among the 197 genes, 4 genes with moderate expression levels and the least variation throughout 9 developmental stages were identified as candidate reference genes. Using four independent statistical algorithms (delta-CT, geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder), the stability of qRT-PCR expression of these candidates was then evaluated and compared to that of actb1 and actb2, two commonly used zebrafish reference genes. Stability rankings showed that two genes, namely mobk13 (mob4) and lsm12b, were more stable than actb1 and actb2 in most cases. To further test the suitability of mobk13 and lsm12b as novel reference genes, they were used to normalize three well-studied target genes. The results showed that mobk13 and lsm12b were more suitable than actb1 and actb2 with respect to zebrafish early development. We recommend mobk13 and lsm12b as new optimal reference genes for zebrafish qRT-PCR analysis during embryogenesis and early larval stages.	2016	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		e0149277		2	11		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26891128 PMCID: PMC4758726					Animals; Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; RNA Stability; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reference Standards; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Since mRNA concentrations and translation are influenced by micro-RNAs (miRNAs), we examined the influence of 1α,25(OH)₂D₃ on miRNA expression in zebrafish in vivo with whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, searched for miRNA binding sites in 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-sensitive genes, and performed correlation analyses between 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-sensitive miRNAs and mRNAs. In vehicle- and 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-treated, 7-day postfertilization larvae, between 282 and 295 known precursor miRNAs were expressed, and in vehicle- and 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-treated fish, between 83 and 122 novel miRNAs were detected. Following 1α,25(OH)₂D₃ treatment, 31 precursor miRNAs were differentially expressed (p<0.05). The differentially expressed miRNAs are predicted to potentially alter mRNAs for metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, growth factors, and Jak-STAT signaling. We verified the role of a 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-sensitive miRNA, miR125b, by demonstrating alterations in the concentrations of the mRNA of a 1α,25(OH)₂D₃-regulated gene, Cyp24a1, following transfection of renal cells with a miR125b miRNA mimic. Changes in the Cyp24a1 mRNA concentration by the miR125b miRNA mimic were associated with changes in the protein for Cyp24a1. Our data show that 1α,25(OH)₂D₃ regulates miRNA in zebrafish larvae in vivo and could thereby influence vitamin D-sensitive mRNA concentrations.	2014-06	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		207-218		3	11		Zebrafish								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24650217 PMCID: PMC4050706					Animals; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; MicroRNAs; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Vitamin D; Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase; Vitamins; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Although extensive studies on arsenic-induced toxicity have been conducted using in vivo and in vitro models, the exact molecular mechanism of arsenate toxicity remains elusive. Here, the RNA-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) sequencing technology was used to analyse hepatic response to arsenic exposure at the transcriptome level. Based on more than 12 million SAGE tags mapped to zebrafish genes, 1,444 differentially expressed genes (750 up-regulated and 694 down-regulated) were identified from a relatively abundant transcripts (>10 TPM [transcripts per million]) based on minimal two-fold change. By gene ontology analyses, these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in several major biological processes including oxidation reduction, translation, iron ion transport, cell redox, homeostasis, etc. Accordingly, the main pathways disturbed include metabolic pathways, proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, cancer, etc. Ingenity Pathway Analysis further revealed a network with four important upstream factors or hub genes, including Jun, Kras, APoE and Nr2f2. The network indicated apparent molecular events involved in oxidative stress, carcinogenesis, and metabolism. In order to identify potential biomarker genes for arsenic exposure, 27 out of 29 up-regulated transcripts were validated by RT-qPCR analysis in pooled RNA samples. Among these, 14 transcripts were further confirmed for up-regulation by a lower dosage of arsenic in majority of individual zebrafish. Finally, at least four of these genes, frh3 (ferrintin H3), mgst1 (microsomal glutathione S-transferase-like), cmbl (carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog) and slc40a1 (solute carrier family 40 [iron-regulated transporter], member 1) could be confirmed in individual medaka fish similarly treated by arsenic; thus, these four genes might be robust arsenic biomarkers across species. Thus, our work represents the first comprehensive investigation of molecular mechanism of asenic toxicity and genome-wide search for potential biomarkers for arsenic exposure.	2013	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		e68737		7	8		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 23922661 PMCID: PMC3726666					Animals; Arsenic; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genome; Liver; Signal Transduction; Toxicogenetics; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

Herein, we provide a mRNAseq dataset on three different zebrafish mutants affecting muscle organization during embryogenesis. These comprise the myosin folding chaperone unc45b (unc45b-/-), heat shock protein 90aa1.1 (hsp90aa1.1-/-) and the acetylcholine esterase (ache-/-) gene. The transcriptome analysis was performed in duplicate experiments at 72 h post-fertilization (hpf) for all three mutants, with two additional times of development (24 hpf and 48 hpf) for unc45b-/-. A total of 20 samples were analyzed by hierarchical clustering for differential gene expression. The data from this study support the observation made in Etard et al. (2015) [1] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0825-8) that a failure to fold myosin activates a unique transcriptional program in the skeletal muscles that is different from that induced in stressed muscle cells.	2016-09	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		61-68			8		Data Brief								eng					PubMed		PMID: 27274534 PMCID: PMC4885013					Development; Genetics; Muscle mutant; Zebrafish; mRNASeq																																																																																																																																				
MBAR97P7	journalArticle	2016	Johnstone, Timothy G.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; Giraldez, Antonio J.	Upstream ORFs are prevalent translational repressors in vertebrates	The EMBO journal		1460-2075	10.15252/embj.201592759		Regulation of gene expression is fundamental in establishing cellular diversity and a target of natural selection. Untranslated mRNA regions (UTRs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have predicted thousands of ORFs in 5'UTRs, the vast majority of which have unknown function. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the translation and function of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) across vertebrates. Using high-resolution ribosome footprinting, we find that (i)uORFs are prevalent within vertebrate transcriptomes, (ii) the majority show signatures of active translation, and (iii)uORFs act as potent regulators of translation and RNA levels, with a similar magnitude to miRNAs. Reporter experiments reveal clear repression of downstream translation by uORFs/oORFs. uORF number, intercistronic distance, overlap with the CDS, and initiation context most strongly influence translation. Evolution has targeted these features to favor uORFs amenable to regulation over constitutively repressive uORFs/oORFs. Finally, we observe that the regulatory potential of uORFs on individual genes is conserved across species. These results provide insight into the regulatory code within mRNA leader sequences and their capacity to modulate translation across vertebrates.	2016-04-01	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		706-723		7	35		EMBO J								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26896445 PMCID: PMC4818764					Animals; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; Repressor Proteins; Transcription, Genetic; Vertebrates; gene regulation; ribosome profiling; translation; uORFs

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.	2014-09	2024-03-06 20:20:58	2024-03-06T20:20:58Z		896-902		9	32		Nat Biotechnol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 25150836 PMCID: PMC4404308					Action Potentials; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Sequence Analysis, RNA

We investigated the phylogeny of this group of fishes in relation to teleosts using mitochondrial genomic (mitogenomic) data, and compared this to the various alternative phylogenetic hypotheses that have been proposed previously. In addition to the previously determined complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 14 teleosts and two outgroups, we used newly determined mitogenomic sequences of 12 purposefully chosen species representing all the ancient fish lineages plus related teleosts. This data set comprised concatenated nucleotide sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (excluding the ND6 gene and third codon positions) and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (stem regions only) and these data were subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. The resultant trees from the three methods were well resolved and largely congruent, with most internal branches being supported by high statistical values. Mitogenomic data strongly supported not only the monophyly of the teleosts (osteoglossomorphs and above), but also a sister-group relationship between the teleosts and a clade comprising the acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and Amia, with the polypteriforms occupying the most basal position in the actinopterygian phylogeny. Although the tree topology differed from any of the previously proposed hypotheses based on morphology, it exhibited congruence with a recently proposed novel hypothesis based on nuclear markers.	2003-01	2024-03-06 20:20:57	2024-03-06T20:20:57Z		110-120		1	26		Mol Phylogenet Evol	Basal actinopterygian relationships							eng					PubMed		PMID: 12470943					Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fishes; Genetic Markers; Genome; Phylogeny

Quantitative transportomics identifies Kif5a as a major regulator of neurodegeneration	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.68148		Many neurons in the adult central nervous system, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), degenerate and die after injury. Early axon protein and organelle trafficking failure is a key component in many neurodegenerative disorders yet changes to axoplasmic transport in disease models have not been quantified. We analyzed early changes in the protein 'transportome' from RGC somas to their axons after optic nerve injury and identified transport failure of an anterograde motor protein Kif5a early in RGC degeneration. We demonstrated that manipulating Kif5a expression affects anterograde mitochondrial trafficking in RGCs and characterized axon transport in Kif5a knockout mice to identify proteins whose axon localization was Kif5a-dependent. Finally, we found that knockout of Kif5a in RGCs resulted in progressive RGC degeneration in the absence of injury. Together with expression data localizing Kif5a to human RGCs, these data identify Kif5a transport failure as a cause of RGC neurodegeneration and point to a mechanism for future therapeutics.	2022-03-08	2024-03-06 20:20:57	2024-03-06T20:20:57Z		e68148			11		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 35259089 PMCID: PMC8947766					Animals; Axonal Transport; Axons; Kinesins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nerve Regeneration; Optic Nerve Injuries; Retinal Ganglion Cells; degeneration; mouse; neuroscience; optic nerve; proteomics; rat; regeneration; regenerative medicine; retinal ganglion cell; stem cells

To study the mechanisms of pathology-induced neuro-regeneration in vertebrate brains, zebrafish is an excellent model due to its extensive neural regeneration capacity. Here, we report that Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan, negatively regulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity in adult zebrafish brain through its receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (Ahr2). The production of KYNA is suppressed after amyloid-toxicity through reduction of the levels of Kynurenine amino transferase 2 (KAT2), the key enzyme producing KYNA. NSC proliferation is enhanced by an antagonist for Ahr2 and is reduced with Ahr2 agonists or KYNA. A subset of Ahr2-expressing zebrafish NSCs do not express other regulatory receptors such as il4r or ngfra, indicating that ahr2-positive NSCs constitute a new subset of neural progenitors that are responsive to amyloid-toxicity. By performing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in three late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) brain autopsy cohorts, we also found that several genes that are components of KYNA metabolism or AHR signaling are differentially expressed in LOAD, suggesting a strong link between KYNA/Ahr2 signaling axis to neurogenesis in LOAD.	2021-10-14	2024-03-06 20:20:57	2024-03-06T20:20:57Z		2748		10	10		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 34685728 PMCID: PMC8534484					Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Animals; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Cohort Studies; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Kynurenic Acid; Models, Biological; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; kynurenic acid; neural stem cell; neurogenesis; plasticity; proliferation; regeneration; transcriptome-wide association study; zebrafish

Numerous studies have attempted to reveal how basal cells undergo differentiation or self-renewal; however, this has been hampered by a lack of robust basal cell markers and analytical platforms that allow single-cell tracking. Here, we report that zebrafish integrin beta 4 is a useful marker for basal cell labelling, irrespective of the body region, stage and regenerative status. We employed Cre-loxP recombination in combination with live cell tracking of single basal clones in the caudal fin and investigated the embryonic origin and behaviour of basal cells during fish growth and homeostasis. Although most basal cells, including those in fins, became quiescent in the adult stage, genetic cell ablation showed that basal cells were reactivated to either self-renew or differentiate, depending on the injured cell type. Our study provides a simple and easy-to-use platform for quantitative in vivo imaging of basal stem cells at wider stages and under various conditions.	2024-01-15	2024-03-06 20:20:56	2024-03-06T20:20:56Z		dev202315		2	151		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38265193					Animals; Cell lineage; Cre-loxP; Epidermal Cells; Epidermis; Homeostasis; Integrin beta 4; Keratin 18; Keratinocytes; Zebrafish

Methylation of cytosine residues in genomic DNA is a key epigenetic mark that modulates gene expression and prevents genome instability. Here, we report on a genetic test of the relationship between DNA replication and methylation in the context of the developing vertebrate organism instead of cell lines. Our analysis is based on the identification of hypomorphic alleles of dnmt1, encoding the DNA maintenance methylase Dnmt1, and pole1, encoding the catalytic subunit of leading-strand DNA polymerase epsilon holoenzyme (Pole). Homozygous dnmt1 mutants exhibit genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, whereas the pole1 mutation is associated with increased DNA methylation levels. In dnmt1/pole1 double-mutant zebrafish larvae, DNA methylation levels are restored to near normal values, associated with partial rescue of mutant-associated transcriptional changes and phenotypes. Hence, a balancing antagonism between DNA replication and maintenance methylation buffers against replicative errors contributing to the robustness of vertebrate development.	2024-01-05	2024-03-06 20:20:56	2024-03-06T20:20:56Z		31		1	7		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38182651 PMCID: PMC10770094					Alleles; Animals; DNA; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Zebrafish

Acromegaly is a hormone disorder pathological condition that develops as a result of growth hormone over-secretion from the pituitary gland. We produced a zebrafish acromegaly model to gain a better understanding of the excess GH effects at the cellular level. Here we show that the acromegaly zebrafish model progressively reduced the number of stem cells in different organs and increased oxidative stress in stem cells. Importantly, the decline in the stem cells was even more apparent than in aged fish. The controversy and debate over the use of GH as an anti-aging therapy have been going on for several years. In this study, excess GH induced aging signs such as increased senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase staining of abdominal skin and similarity of the pattern of gene expression between aged and acromegaly zebrafish. Thus, this study highlights the role of excess GH in acromegaly stem cells.	2020-06-07	2024-03-06 20:20:56	2024-03-06T20:20:56Z		120		6	9		Biology (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 32517323 PMCID: PMC7344990					acromegaly; aging; growth hormone; stem cell; zebrafish

Individuals exhibiting the proactive versus reactive stress coping styles display qualitatively different behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors. The predisposition to exhibiting a particular coping style is due to genetic and environmental factors. In this study we explore the neurotranscriptomic and gene network biases that are associated with differences between zebrafish (Danio rerio) lines selected for proactive and reactive coping styles and reared in a common garden environment. RESULTS: Using RNA-sequencing we quantified the basal transcriptomes from the brains of wild-derived zebrafish lines selectively bred to exhibit the proactive or reactive stress coping style. We identified 1953 genes that differed in baseline gene expression levels. Weighted gene coexpression network analyses identified one gene module associated with line differences. Together with our previous pharmacological experiment, we identified a core set of 62 genes associated with line differences. Gene ontology analyses reveal that many of these core genes are implicated in neurometabolism (e.g. organic acid biosynthetic and fatty acid metabolic processes). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that proactive and reactive stress coping individuals display distinct basal neurotranscriptomic states. Differences in baseline expression of select genes or regulation of specific gene modules are linked to the magnitude of the behavioral response and the display of a coping style, respectively. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of stress coping from one focused on the neurotransmitter systems to a more complex system that involves an organism's capability to handle neurometabolic loads and allows for comparisons with other animal taxa to uncover potential conserved mechanisms.	2015-06-02	2024-03-06 20:20:56	2024-03-06T20:20:56Z		425		1	16		BMC Genomics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 26032017 PMCID: PMC4450845					Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Fatty Acids; Gene Regulatory Networks; RNA; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Stress, Psychological; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

In contrast, scenarios of global gene expression shifts are many and increasing. Here we compare the performance of three normalization methods when polyA(+) RNA content fluctuates significantly during zebrafish early developmental stages. As a benchmark we have used reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results show that reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) and trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization systematically leads to biased gene expression estimates. Biological scaling normalization (BSN), designed to handle differences in total expression, showed improved accuracy compared to the two other methods in estimating transcript level dynamics. The results have implications for past and future studies using RNA-sequencing on samples with different levels of total or polyA(+) RNA.	2014	2024-03-06 20:20:56	2024-03-06T20:20:56Z		e89158		2	9		PLoS One								eng					PubMed		PMID: 24586560 PMCID: PMC3934880					Animals; Base Sequence; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zebrafish

The emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is finely tuned by a variety of signaling pathways. Previous studies have revealed the roles of pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors in hematopoiesis. In this study, we find that Nlrc3, a nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing family gene, is highly expressed in hematopoietic differentiation stages in vivo and vitro and is required in hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Mechanistically, nlrc3 activates the Notch pathway and the downstream gene of Notch hey1. Furthermore, NF-kB signaling acts upstream of nlrc3 to enhance its transcriptional activity. Finally, we find that Nlrc3 signaling is conserved in the regulation of murine embryonic hematopoiesis. Taken together, our findings uncover an indispensable role of Nlrc3 signaling in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence and provide insights into inflammation-related hematopoietic ontogeny and the in vitro expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	2024-01-03	2024-03-06 20:20:55	2024-03-06T20:20:55Z		226		1	15		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38172511 PMCID: PMC10764762					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Mice; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Zebrafish

A Role for Two-Pore Channel Type 2 (TPC2)-Mediated Regulation of Membrane Contact Sites During Zebrafish Notochord Biogenesis?	Contact (Thousand Oaks (Ventura County, Calif.))		2515-2564	10.1177/25152564231211409		We have previously shown that in the developing trunk of zebrafish embryos, two-pore channel type 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release from endolysosomes plays a role in the formation of the skeletal slow muscle. In addition, TPC2-mediated Ca2+ signaling is required for axon extension and the establishment of synchronized activity in the primary motor neurons. Here, we report that TPC2 might also play a role in the development of the notochord of zebrafish embryos. For example, when tpcn2 was knocked down or out, increased numbers of small vacuoles were formed in the inner notochord cells, compared with the single large vacuole in the notochord of control embryos. This abnormal vacuolation was associated with embryos displaying attenuated body axis straightening. We also showed that TPC2 has a distinct pattern of localization in the notochord in embryos at ∼24 hpf. Finally, we conducted RNAseq to identify differentially expressed genes in tpcn2 mutants compared to wild-type controls, and found that those involved in actin filament severing, cellular component morphogenesis, Ca2+ binding, and structural constituent of cytoskeleton were downregulated in the mutants. Together, our data suggest that TPC2 activity plays a key role in notochord biogenesis in zebrafish embryos.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:55	2024-03-06T20:20:55Z		25152564231211409			6		Contact (Thousand Oaks)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38028019 PMCID: PMC10658360					endolysosomal vesicles; notochord development; tpcn2 mutants and morphants; trans-Ned19; two-pore channel type 2; zebrafish embryos

Due to its early neonatal lethality in mice, the detailed impact of the constitutive homozygous NEXN knockout on heart and skeletal muscle morphology and function is insufficiently investigated. Here, we characterized a constitutive homozygous CRISPR/Cas9-mediated nexn knockout zebrafish model. We found that Nexn deficient embryos developed significantly reduced cardiac contractility and under stressed conditions also impaired skeletal muscle organization whereas skeletal muscle function seemed not to be affected. Remarkably, in contrast to nexn morphants, CRISPR/Cas9 nexn-/- knockout embryos showed a milder phenotype without the development of a pronounced pericardial edema or blood congestion. nexn-specific expression analysis as well as whole transcriptome profiling suggest some degree of compensatory mechanisms. Transcripts of numerous essential sarcomeric proteins were massively induced and may mediate a sarcomere stabilizing function in nexn-/- knockout embryos. Our findings demonstrate the successful generation and characterization of a constitutive homozygous nexn knockout line enabling the detailed investigation of the role of nexn on heart and skeletal muscle development and function as well as to assess putative compensatory mechanisms induced by the loss of Nexn.	2023-12-19	2024-03-06 20:20:55	2024-03-06T20:20:55Z		22679		1	13		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38114601 PMCID: PMC10730861					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Humans; Mice; Microfilament Proteins; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b-/- zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance.	2024-01	2024-03-06 20:20:55	2024-03-06T20:20:55Z		e2302325		4	11		Adv Sci (Weinh)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38059818 PMCID: PMC10811472					Aldehydes; Aldh9a1b; Animals; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Gluconeogenesis; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Zebrafish; diabetic retinopathy; insulin resistance; omega-6 fatty acids; prediabetes; trans, trans-2,4-decadienal; zebrafish

Molecular analyses of zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons and identification of transcriptional regulators downstream of Evx1 and Evx2 in these cells	Neural Development		1749-8104	10.1186/s13064-023-00176-w		BACKGROUND: V0v spinal interneurons are highly conserved, glutamatergic, commissural neurons that function in locomotor circuits. We have previously shown that Evx1 and Evx2 are required to specify the neurotransmitter phenotype of these cells. However, we still know very little about the gene regulatory networks that act downstream of these transcription factors in V0v cells. METHODS: To identify candidate members of V0v gene regulatory networks, we FAC-sorted wild-type and evx1;evx2 double mutant zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons and expression-profiled them using microarrays and single cell RNA-seq. We also used in situ hybridization to compare expression of a subset of candidate genes in evx1;evx2 double mutants and wild-type siblings. RESULTS: Our data reveal two molecularly distinct subtypes of zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons at 48 h and suggest that, by this stage of development, evx1;evx2 double mutant cells transfate into either inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Our results also identify 25 transcriptional regulator genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons, plus a further 11 transcriptional regulator genes that are repressed in V0v interneurons by Evx1/2. Two of the latter genes are hmx2 and hmx3a. Intriguingly, we show that Hmx2/3a, repress dI2 interneuron expression of skor1a and nefma, two genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons. This suggests that Evx1/2 might regulate skor1a and nefma expression in V0v interneurons by repressing Hmx2/3a expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies two molecularly distinct subsets of zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons, as well as multiple transcriptional regulators that are strong candidates for acting downstream of Evx1/2 to specify the essential functional characteristics of these cells. Our data further suggest that in the absence of both Evx1 and Evx2, V0v spinal interneurons initially change their neurotransmitter phenotypes from excitatory to inhibitory and then, later, start to express markers of distinct types of inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Taken together, our findings significantly increase our knowledge of V0v and spinal development and move us closer towards the essential goal of identifying the complete gene regulatory networks that specify this crucial cell type.	2023-11-28	2024-03-06 20:20:54	2024-03-06T20:20:54Z		8		1	18		Neural Dev								eng					PubMed		PMID: 38017520 PMCID: PMC10683209					Animals; Gene regulatory network (GRN); Glutamatergic; Hmx3; Interneurons; Motor Neurons; Neuronal intermediate filament (NIF); Neurotransmitter Agents; Skor; Spinal cord; Transcription Factors; V0 interneurons; V1 cells; Zebrafish; scRNA-seq

Competition for H2A.Z underlies the developmental impacts of repetitive element de-repression	Development (Cambridge, England)		1477-9129	10.1242/dev.202338		The histone variant H2A.Z is central to early embryonic development, determining transcriptional competency through chromatin regulation of gene promoters and enhancers. In addition to genic loci, we find that H2A.Z resides at a subset of evolutionarily young repetitive elements, including DNA transposons, long interspersed nuclear elements and long terminal repeats, during early zebrafish development. Moreover, increases in H2A.Z occur when repetitive elements become transcriptionally active. Acquisition of H2A.Z corresponds with a reduction in the levels of the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 and a moderate increase in chromatin accessibility. Notably, however, de-repression of repetitive elements also leads to a significant reduction in H2A.Z over non-repetitive genic loci. Genic loss of H2A.Z is accompanied by transcriptional silencing at adjacent coding sequences, but remarkably, these impacts are mitigated by augmentation of total H2A.Z protein via transgenic overexpression. Our study reveals that levels of H2A.Z protein determine embryonic sensitivity to de-repression of repetitive elements, that repetitive elements can function as a nuclear sink for epigenetic factors and that competition for H2A.Z greatly influences overall transcriptional output during development. These findings uncover general mechanisms in which counteractive biological processes underlie phenotypic outcomes.	2023-11-01	2024-03-06 20:20:54	2024-03-06T20:20:54Z		dev202338		21	150		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37938830 PMCID: PMC10651094					Animals; Chromatin; Embryonic Development; Epigenetics; Histone H2A.Z; Histones; Nucleosomes; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Repetitive elements; Transposons; Zebrafish

However, generating functional human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived HSPCs and their derivatives has been elusive, necessitating a better understanding of the developmental mechanisms that trigger HSPC specification. Here, we reveal that early activation of the Nod1-Ripk2-NF-kB inflammatory pathway in endothelial cells (ECs) primes them to switch fate towards definitive hemogenic endothelium, a pre-requisite to specify HSPCs. Our genetic and chemical embryonic models show that HSPCs fail to specify in the absence of Nod1 and its downstream kinase Ripk2 due to a failure on hemogenic endothelial (HE) programming, and that small Rho GTPases coordinate the activation of this pathway. Manipulation of NOD1 in a human system of definitive hematopoietic differentiation indicates functional conservation. This work establishes the RAC1-NOD1-RIPK2-NF-kB axis as a critical intrinsic inductor that primes ECs prior to HE fate switch and HSPC specification. Manipulation of this pathway could help derive a competent HE amenable to specify functional patient specific HSPCs and their derivatives for the treatment of blood disorders.	2023-11-23	2024-03-06 20:20:54	2024-03-06T20:20:54Z		7668		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37996457 PMCID: PMC10667254					Cell Differentiation; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; NF-kappa B; rho GTP-Binding Proteins

Depletion of tet2 results in age-dependent changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in a zebrafish model of myelodysplastic syndrome	Frontiers in Hematology		2813-3935	10.3389/frhem.2023.1235170		INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and dysplasia. The gene encoding ten-eleven translocation 2 (tet2), a dioxygenase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, is a recurrently mutated tumor suppressor gene in MDS and other myeloid malignancies. Previously, we reported a stable zebrafish line with a loss-of-function mutation in the tet2 gene. The tet2m/m-mutant zebrafish developed a pre-MDS state with kidney marrow dysplasia, but normal circulating blood counts by 11 months of age and accompanying anemia, signifying the onset of MDS, by 24 months of age. METHODS: In the current study, we collected progenitor cells from the kidney marrows of the adult tet2m/m and tet2wt/wt fish at 4 and 15 months of age and conducted enhanced reduced representation of bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) and bulk RNA-seq to measure changes in DNA methylation and gene expression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A global increase in DNA methylation of gene promoter regions and CpG islands was observed in tet2m/m HSPCs at 4 months of age when compared with the wild type. Furthermore, hypermethylated genes were significantly enriched for targets of SUZ12 and the metal-response-element-binding transcription factor 2 (MTF2)-involved in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). However, between 4 and 15 months of age, we observed a paradoxical global decrease in DNA methylation in tet2m/m HSPCs. Gene expression analyses identified upregulation of genes associated with mTORC1 signaling and interferon gamma and alpha responses in tet2m/m HSPCs at 4 months of age when compared with the wild type. Downregulated genes in HSPCs of tet2-mutant fish at 4 months of age were enriched for cell cycle regulation, heme metabolism, and interleukin 2 (IL2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling, possibly related to increased self-renewal and clonal advantage in HSPCs with tet2 loss of function. Finally, there was an overall inverse correlation between overall increased promoter methylation and gene expression.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:53	2024-03-06T20:20:53Z		1235170			2		Front Hematol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37937078 PMCID: PMC10629367					DNA methylation; TET2; hematopoietic progenitors; myelodysplastic syndrome; zebrafish

Zebrafish are increasingly used as a simple vertebrate model for testing toxic and physiological effects of compounds, especially on development. Here, we tested 12 ethanolic extracts from popular medicinal plants collected in northern Vietnam for their effects on zebrafish survival and development during the first 4 days after fertilization. We characterized more in detail their effects on epiboly, hatching, growth, necrosis, body curvature, angiogenesis, skeletal development and mostly increased movement behavior. Finally, we confirm the effect on epiboly caused by the Mahonia bealei extract by staining the actin filaments and performing whole genome gene expression analysis. Further, we show that this extract also inhibits cell migration of mouse embryo fibroblasts. Finally, we analyzed the chemical composition of the Mahonia bealei extract and test the effects of its major components. In conclusion, we show that traditional medicinal plant extracts are able to affect zebrafish early life stage development to various degrees. In addition, we show that an extract causing delay in epiboly also inhibits mammalian cell migration, suggesting that this effect may serve as a preliminary test for identifying extracts that inhibit cancer metastasis.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:42	2024-03-06T20:20:42Z		e0294048		11	18		PLoS One	Testing biological actions of medicinal plants from northern Vietnam on zebrafish embryos and larvae							eng					PubMed		PMID: 37934745 PMCID: PMC10629648					Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Larva; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Vietnam; Zebrafish																																																																																																																																				
QGM8X4P8	journalArticle	2023	Kim, Minwook; So, Juhoon; Shin, Donghun	PPARα activation promotes liver progenitor cell-mediated liver regeneration by suppressing YAP signaling in zebrafish	Scientific Reports		2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-023-44935-5		Despite the robust regenerative capacity of the liver, prolonged and severe liver damage impairs liver regeneration, leading to liver failure. Since the liver co-opts the differentiation of liver progenitor cells (LPCs) into hepatocytes to restore functional hepatocytes, augmenting LPC-mediated liver regeneration may be beneficial to patients with chronic liver diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation have remained largely unknown. Using the zebrafish model of LPC-mediated liver regeneration, Tg(fabp10a:pt-β-catenin), we present that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) activation augments LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. We found that treating Tg(fabp10a:pt-β-catenin) larvae with GW7647, a potent PPARα agonist, enhanced the expression of hepatocyte markers and simultaneously reduced the expression of biliary epithelial cell (BEC)/LPC markers in the regenerating livers, indicating enhanced LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, PPARα activation augments the differentiation by suppressing YAP signaling. The differentiation phenotypes resulting from GW7647 treatment were rescued by expressing a constitutively active form of Yap1. Moreover, we found that suppression of YAP signaling was sufficient to promote LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. Treating Tg(fabp10a:pt-β-catenin) larvae with the TEAD inhibitor K-975, which suppresses YAP signaling, phenocopied the effect of GW7647 on LPC differentiation. Altogether, our findings provide insights into augmenting LPC-mediated liver regeneration as a regenerative therapy for chronic liver diseases.	2023-10-25	2024-03-06 20:20:42	2024-03-06T20:20:42Z		18312		1	13		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37880271 PMCID: PMC10600117					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Hepatocytes; Liver; Liver Diseases; Liver Regeneration; PPAR alpha; Stem Cells; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Zebrafish; beta Catenin

MCPIP1 also controls numerous tumor-related processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. In this study, we utilized a zebrafish model to investigate the role of Mcpip1 during embryogenic development. Our results demonstrated that during embryogenesis, the expression of the zc3h12a gene encoding Mcpip1 undergoes dynamic changes. Its transcript levels gradually increase from the 2-cell stage to the spherical stage and then decrease rapidly. We further found that ectopic overexpression of wild-type Mcpip1 but not the catalytically inactive mutant form resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype in zebrafish embryos (24 hpf). At the molecular level, transcriptomic profiling revealed extensive changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins important in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and in protein folding as well as involved in the formation of primary germ layer, mesendoderm and endoderm development, heart morphogenesis and cell migration. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the expression of zc3h12a must be tightly controlled during the first cell divisions of zebrafish embryos and that a rapid decrease in its mRNA expression is an important factor promoting proper embryo development.	2023-10-07	2024-03-06 20:20:42	2024-03-06T20:20:42Z		16944		1	13		Sci Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37805647 PMCID: PMC10560294					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Embryonic Development; Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins; Ribonucleases; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish

We developed a chronic low light (CLL) exposure model that more accurately reflects chronic PR degeneration observed in many human retinal diseases. Methods: Here, we characterize the morphological and transcriptomic changes associated with acute and chronic models of PR degeneration at 8 time-points over a 28-day window using immunohistochemistry and 3'mRNA-seq. Results: We first observed a differential sensitivity of rod and cone PRs to CLL. Next, we found no evidence for Müller glia (MG) gliosis or regenerative cell-cycle re-entry in the CLL model, which is in contrast to the robust gliosis and proliferative response from resident MG in the AL model. Differential responses of microglia between the models was also observed. Transcriptomic comparisons between the models revealed gene-specific networks of PR regeneration and degeneration, including genes that are activated under conditions of chronic PR stress. Finally, we showed that CLL is at least partially reversible, allowing for rod and cone outer segment outgrowth and replacement of rod cell nuclei via an apparent upregulation of the existing rod neurogenesis mechanism. Discussion: Collectively, these data provide a direct comparison of the morphological and transcriptomic PR degeneration and regeneration models in zebrafish.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:41	2024-03-06T20:20:41Z		1233269			11		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37745292 PMCID: PMC10512720					3′mRNA-seq; Müller glia; chronic light; microglia; photoreceptor degeneration; rod precursor; stem cell; zebrafish

We hypothesized that paternal stress can negatively impact the progeny, altering different miRs and triggering different physiological alterations that could compromise offspring development. To investigate this, we exposed zebrafish male siblings to a chronic stress protocol for 21 days. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses to identify differentially expressed small noncoding RNAs in 7-day postfertilization (dpf) larvae derived from paternally stressed males crossed with control females compared with the control progeny. We found a single miRNA differentially expressed-miR-29a-which was validated in larva and was also tested in the sperm, testicles, and brain of the stressed progenitors. We observed a vertical transmission of chronic stress to the unexposed larvae, reporting novel consequences of paternally inherited chronic stress at a molecular level. The deregulation of mi-R29a in those larvae could affect relevant biological processes affecting development, morphogenesis, or neurogenesis, among others. Additionally, these disruptions were associated with reduced rates of survival and hatching in the affected offspring.	2023-09-14	2024-03-06 20:20:41	2024-03-06T20:20:41Z		14107		18	24		Int J Mol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37762407 PMCID: PMC10531283					Animals; Female; Male; MicroRNAs; Paternal Exposure; RNA-seq; Semen; Spermatozoa; Zebrafish; behavior; chronic stress; hatching rates; malformations; offspring; small-RNAs; survival

Although multiple proteases and enzymes involved in post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins regulate leukocyte recruitment, an unbiased functional screen of enzymes regulating inflammatory leukocyte recruitment has yet to be undertaken. Here, using a zebrafish tail fin amputation (TFA) model to screen a chemical library consisting of 295 compounds that target proteases and PTM enzymes, we identified multiple histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that modulate inflammatory neutrophil recruitment. AR-42, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, was shown to inhibit neutrophil recruitment in three different zebrafish sterile tissue injury models: a TFA model, a copper-induced neuromast damage and mechanical otic vesicle injury (MOVI) model, and a sterile murine peritonitis model. RNA sequencing analysis of AR-42-treated fish embryos revealed downregulation of neutrophil-associated cytokines/chemokines, and exogenous supplementation with recombinant human IL-1β and CXCL8 partially restored the defective neutrophil recruitment in AR-42-treated MOVI model fish embryos. We thus demonstrate that AR-42 non-cell-autonomously modulates neutrophil recruitment by suppressing transcriptional expression of cytokines/chemokines, thereby identifying AR-42 as a promising anti-inflammatory drug for treating sterile tissue injury-associated diseases.	2023-10-01	2024-03-06 20:20:40	2024-03-06T20:20:40Z		dmm050056		10	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37728477 PMCID: PMC10621070					AR-42; Animals; Cell migration; Chemokines; HDAC; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Mice; Neutrophil; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; Peptide Hydrolases; Zebrafish

ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that, in tetrapods, the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a critical role in the evolution of the Krüppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily. Currently, it is unknown whether this function and coevolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs or is a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver of the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from 3221 genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in diverse animal species. We further investigate the largest ZNF subfamily found in cyprinid fish, which is characterized by a conserved sequence we dubbed the fish N-terminal zinc finger-associated (FiNZ) domain. Zebrafish possess approximately 700 FiNZ-ZNFs, many of which are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, most zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed at the onset of zygotic genome activation, and blocking their translation using morpholinos during early embryogenesis results in derepression of transcriptionally active TEs. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution.	2023-08	2024-03-06 20:20:40	2024-03-06T20:20:40Z		1325-1339		8	33		Genome Res								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37714714 PMCID: PMC10547256					Animals; DNA Transposable Elements; Evolution, Molecular; Mammals; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zinc Fingers

Dataset for diseases associated with exposure to broflanilide, a novel pesticide, in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)	Data in Brief		2352-3409	10.1016/j.dib.2023.109534		Broflanilide is a novel pesticide that can antagonize ion channels and disrupt neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to either 0, 1 or 10- µg/L broflanilide in the water for a period of 7 days during early development. RNA extraction was conducted on larval zebrafish for RNA-seq analysis using the Illumina NovoSeq 6000. Raw sequence data were processed through fastp and clean reads obtained by removing adapter and poly-N sequences. Alignment and differential gene expression analysis was conducted using HISAT2, StringTie assembler, and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced). Subnetwork enrichment analysis (SNEA) revealed that exposure to 1 µg/L broflanilide altered gene networks associated with axonal injury, depression, neuroinflammation, and traumatic brain injury while exposure to 10- µg/L broflanilide resulted in changes in gene networks associated with brain infarction and ischemia, excitotoxicity, and neurogenic inflammation. In addition, genes related to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity were altered by broflanilide which has relevance for Parkinson's disease. Several transcripts were identified as being associated with a disease network link to neurodegeneration and included phospholipase A2 activating protein, calpain 1, ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2, glia maturation factor beta, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2C, lysosomal associated membrane protein, and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha among others. Data presented here include disease biomarkers for a novel pesticide and can be reused to refine models that describe adverse outcome pathways for neurotoxicity.	2023-10	2024-03-06 20:20:40	2024-03-06T20:20:40Z		109534			50		Data Brief								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37727589 PMCID: PMC10505664					Disease; Gene networks; Pesticide; Risk assessment; Toxicity assays																																																																																																																																				
BJRQINNF	journalArticle	2023	DeMoya, Ricardo A.; Forman-Rubinsky, Rachel E.; Fontaine, Deon; Shin, Joseph; Watkins, Simon C.; Lo, Cecilia W.; Tsang, Michael	Sin3a associated protein 130 kDa, sap130, plays an evolutionary conserved role in zebrafish heart development	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology		2296-634X	10.3389/fcell.2023.1197109		Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart disease where the left ventricle is reduced in size. A forward genetic screen in mice identified SIN3A associated protein 130 kDa (Sap130), part of the chromatin modifying SIN3A/HDAC complex, as a gene contributing to the etiology of HLHS. Here, we report the role of zebrafish sap130 genes in heart development. Loss of sap130a, one of two Sap130 orthologs, resulted in smaller ventricle size, a phenotype reminiscent to the hypoplastic left ventricle in mice. While cardiac progenitors were normal during somitogenesis, diminution of the ventricle size suggest the Second Heart Field (SHF) was the source of the defect. To explore the role of sap130a in gene regulation, transcriptome profiling was performed after the heart tube formation to identify candidate pathways and genes responsible for the small ventricle phenotype. Genes involved in cardiac differentiation and cardiac function were dysregulated in sap130a, but not in sap130b mutants. Confocal light sheet analysis measured deficits in cardiac output in MZsap130a supporting the notion that cardiomyocyte maturation was disrupted. Lineage tracing experiments revealed a significant reduction of SHF cells in the ventricle that resulted in increased outflow tract size. These data suggest that sap130a is involved in cardiogenesis via regulating the accretion of SHF cells to the growing ventricle and in their subsequent maturation for cardiac function. Further, genetic studies revealed an interaction between hdac1 and sap130a, in the incidence of small ventricles. These studies highlight the conserved role of Sap130a and Hdac1 in zebrafish cardiogenesis.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:39	2024-03-06T20:20:39Z		1197109			11		Front Cell Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37711853 PMCID: PMC10498550					SIN3A/HDAC complex; cardiac development; congenital heart disease; second heart field; zebrafish

Those TFs create open chromatin regions, promote histone acetylation on enhancers, and activate transcription. Here, we use the panel of single, double and triple mutants for zebrafish genome activators Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, multi-omics and mathematical modeling to investigate the combinatorial mechanisms of genome activation. We show that Pou5f3 and Nanog act differently on synergistic and antagonistic enhancer types. Pou5f3 and Nanog both bind as pioneer-like TFs on synergistic enhancers, promote histone acetylation and activate transcription. Antagonistic enhancers are activated by binding of one of these factors. The other TF binds as non-pioneer-like TF, competes with the activator and blocks all its effects, partially or completely. This activator-blocker mechanism mutually restricts widespread transcriptional activation by Pou5f3 and Nanog and prevents premature expression of late developmental regulators in the early embryo.	2023-09-14	2024-03-06 20:20:39	2024-03-06T20:20:39Z		5677		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37709752 PMCID: PMC10502082					Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Histones; Mammals; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish

Sinus venosus adaptation models prolonged cardiovascular disease and reveals insights into evolutionary transitions of the vertebrate heart	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-023-41184-y		How two-chambered hearts in basal vertebrates have evolved from single-chamber hearts found in ancestral chordates remains unclear. Here, we show that the teleost sinus venosus (SV) is a chamber-like vessel comprised of an outer layer of smooth muscle cells. We find that in adult zebrafish nr2f1a mutants, which lack atria, the SV comes to physically resemble the thicker bulbus arteriosus (BA) at the arterial pole of the heart through an adaptive, hypertensive response involving smooth muscle proliferation due to aberrant hemodynamic flow. Single cell transcriptomics show that smooth muscle and endothelial cell populations within the adapting SV also take on arterial signatures. Bulk transcriptomics of the blood sinuses flanking the tunicate heart reinforce a model of greater equivalency in ancestral chordate BA and SV precursors. Our data simultaneously reveal that secondary complications from congenital heart defects can develop in adult zebrafish similar to those in humans and that the foundation of equivalency between flanking auxiliary vessels may remain latent within basal vertebrate hearts.	2023-09-07	2024-03-06 20:20:39	2024-03-06T20:20:39Z		5509		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37679366 PMCID: PMC10485058					Acclimatization; Adult; Animals; Arteries; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chordata; Heart Atria; Humans; Zebrafish

Infection-experienced HSPCs protect against infections by generating neutrophils with enhanced mitochondrial bactericidal activity	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.adf9904		Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) respond to infection by proliferating and generating in-demand neutrophils through a process called emergency granulopoiesis (EG). Recently, infection-induced changes in HSPCs have also been shown to underpin the longevity of trained immunity, where they generate innate immune cells with enhanced responses to subsequent microbial threats. Using larval zebrafish to live image neutrophils and HSPCs, we show that infection-experienced HSPCs generate neutrophils with enhanced bactericidal functions. Transcriptomic analysis of EG neutrophils uncovered a previously unknown function for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in elevating neutrophil bactericidal activity. We also reveal that driving expression of zebrafish C/EBPβ within infection-naïve HSPCs is sufficient to generate neutrophils with similarly enhanced bactericidal capacity. Our work suggests that this demand-adapted source of neutrophils contributes to trained immunity by providing enhanced protection toward subsequent infections. Manipulating demand-driven granulopoiesis may provide a therapeutic strategy to boost neutrophil function and treat infectious disease.	2023-09-08	2024-03-06 20:20:39	2024-03-06T20:20:39Z		eadf9904		36	9		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37672586 PMCID: PMC10482338					Animals; Bacterial Infections; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Larva; Reactive Oxygen Species; Trained Immunity; Zebrafish

Spinal cord repair is modulated by the neurogenic factor Hb-egf under direction of a regeneration-associated enhancer	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-023-40486-5		Unlike adult mammals, zebrafish regenerate spinal cord tissue and recover locomotor ability after a paralyzing injury. Here, we find that ependymal cells in zebrafish spinal cords produce the neurogenic factor Hb-egfa upon transection injury. Animals with hb-egfa mutations display defective swim capacity, axon crossing, and tissue bridging after spinal cord transection, associated with disrupted indicators of neuron production. Local recombinant human HB-EGF delivery alters ependymal cell cycling and tissue bridging, enhancing functional regeneration. Epigenetic profiling reveals a tissue regeneration enhancer element (TREE) linked to hb-egfa that directs gene expression in spinal cord injuries. Systemically delivered recombinant AAVs containing this zebrafish TREE target gene expression to crush injuries of neonatal, but not adult, murine spinal cords. Moreover, enhancer-based HB-EGF delivery by AAV administration improves axon densities after crush injury in neonatal cords. Our results identify Hb-egf as a neurogenic factor necessary for innate spinal cord regeneration and suggest strategies to improve spinal cord repair in mammals.	2023-08-11	2024-03-06 20:20:38	2024-03-06T20:20:38Z		4857		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37567873 PMCID: PMC10421883					Animals; Axons; Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor; Humans; Mammals; Mice; Nerve Regeneration; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Cord Regeneration; Zebrafish

The two main forms of energy fuel can be found in the form of glucose or fat. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to glucose or injected with free fatty acid/Triacylglycerol (FFA/TAG) into the yolk sac at 24 hpf. At 72 hpf, glucose exposed or FFA/TAG injected had differential effects on gene expression in embryos, with fat activating lipolysis and β-oxidation and glucose activating the insulin pathway. Bulk RNA-seq revealed that more gene expression was affected by glucose exposure compared to FFA/TAGs injection. Appetite-controlling genes were also differently affected by glucose exposure or FFA/TAG injections. Because the embryo did not yet feed itself at the time of our analysis, gene expression changes occurred in absence of actual hunger and revealed how the embryo manages its nutrient intake before active feeding.	2023-07-21	2024-03-06 20:20:38	2024-03-06T20:20:38Z		107063		7	26		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37534154 PMCID: PMC10391732					Embryology; Model organism; Transcriptomics

In this study, we generated add1-deficient zebrafish to investigate its role in hematopoiesis. Lack of add1 impaired both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, preventing healthy erythrocyte development. RNA sequencing revealed activation of the p53 pathway in add1-depleted erythroblast cells, leading to apoptosis at the 14-somites stage and 24 hpf. Interestingly, partial rescue of the anemic phenotype and apoptosis was observed with p53 insufficiency. Mechanistically, ADD1 was found to regulate promoter activity. These findings demonstrate that Add1 plays a crucial role in zebrafish erythropoiesis, involving the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway, expanding its regulatory role beyond cytoskeletal functions.	2023-09-15	2024-03-06 20:20:38	2024-03-06T20:20:38Z		107516		9	26		iScience								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37636049 PMCID: PMC10448115					Biochemistry; Biological sciences; Cell biology; Molecular biology

Loss of Mtm1 causes cholestatic liver disease in a model of X-linked myotubular myopathy	The Journal of Clinical Investigation		1558-8238	10.1172/JCI166275		X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a fatal congenital disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. Currently, there are no approved treatments, although AAV8-mediated gene transfer therapy has shown promise in animal models and preliminarily in patients. However, 4 patients with XLMTM treated with gene therapy have died from progressive liver failure, and hepatobiliary disease has now been recognized more broadly in association with XLMTM. In an attempt to understand whether loss of MTM1 itself is associated with liver pathology, we have characterized what we believe to be a novel liver phenotype in a zebrafish model of this disease. Specifically, we found that loss-of-function mutations in mtm1 led to severe liver abnormalities including impaired bile flux, structural abnormalities of the bile canaliculus, and improper endosome-mediated trafficking of canalicular transporters. Using a reporter-tagged Mtm1 zebrafish line, we established localization of Mtm1 in the liver in association with Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes, and canalicular transport proteins and demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific reexpression of Mtm1 could rescue the cholestatic phenotype. Last, we completed a targeted chemical screen and found that Dynasore, a dynamin-2 inhibitor, was able to partially restore bile flow and transporter localization to the canalicular membrane. In summary, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, liver abnormalities that were directly caused by MTM1 mutation in a preclinical model, thus establishing the critical framework for better understanding and comprehensive treatment of the human disease.	2023-09-15	2024-03-06 20:20:37	2024-03-06T20:20:37Z		e166275		18	133		J Clin Invest								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37490339 PMCID: PMC10503795					Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Hepatology; Humans; Membrane Transport Proteins; Monogenic diseases; Muscle Biology; Muscle, Skeletal; Mutation; Myopathies, Structural, Congenital; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Non-Receptor; Zebrafish

Glucocorticoid receptor regulates protein chaperone, circadian clock and affective disorder genes in the zebrafish brain	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.050141		Glucocorticoid resistance is commonly observed in depression, and has been linked to reduced expression and/or function of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1 in human, hereafter referred to as GR). Previous studies have shown that GR-mutant zebrafish exhibit behavioural abnormalities that are indicative of an affective disorder, suggesting that GR plays a role in brain function. We compared the brain methylomes and brain transcriptomes of adult wild-type and GR-mutant zebrafish, and identified 249 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are regulated by GR. These include a cluster of CpG sites within the first intron of fkbp5, the gene encoding the glucocorticoid-inducible heat shock protein co-chaperone Fkbp5. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that genes associated with chaperone-mediated protein folding, the regulation of circadian rhythm and the regulation of metabolism are particularly sensitive to loss of GR function. In addition, we identified subsets of genes exhibiting GR-regulated transcription that are known to regulate behaviour, and are linked to unipolar depression and anxiety. Taken together, our results identify key biological processes and novel molecular mechanisms through which the GR is likely to mediate responses to stress in the adult zebrafish brain, and they provide further support for the zebrafish GR mutant as a model for the study of affective disorders.	2023-09-01	2024-03-06 20:20:37	2024-03-06T20:20:37Z		dmm050141		9	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37525888 PMCID: PMC10565112					Adult; Animals; Brain; Circadian Clocks; DNA methylation; Glucocorticoid; Humans; Mood Disorders; Nervous system; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Transcriptome; Zebrafish

The Tumor Suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (apc) Is Required for Neural Crest-Dependent Craniofacial Development in Zebrafish	Journal of Developmental Biology		2221-3759	10.3390/jdb11030029		Neural crest (NC) is a unique vertebrate cell type arising from the border of the neural plate and epidermis that gives rise to diverse tissues along the entire body axis. Roberto Mayor and colleagues have made major contributions to our understanding of NC induction, delamination, and migration. We report that a truncating mutation of the classical tumor suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (apc) disrupts craniofacial development in zebrafish larvae, with a marked reduction in the cranial neural crest (CNC) cells that contribute to mandibular and hyoid pharyngeal arches. While the mechanism is not yet clear, the altered expression of signaling molecules that guide CNC migration could underlie this phenotype. For example, apcmcr/mcr larvae express substantially higher levels of complement c3, which Mayor and colleagues showed impairs CNC cell migration when overexpressed. However, we also observe reduction in stroma-derived factor 1 (sdf1/cxcl12), which is required for CNC migration into the head. Consistent with our previous work showing that APC directly enhances the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and, independently, that GSK-3 phosphorylates multiple core mRNA splicing factors, we identify 340 mRNA splicing variations in apc mutant zebrafish, including a splice variant that deletes a conserved domain in semaphorin 3f (sema3f), an axonal guidance molecule and a known regulator of CNC migration. Here, we discuss potential roles for apc in CNC development in the context of some of the seminal findings of Mayor and colleagues.	2023-06-29	2024-03-06 20:20:36	2024-03-06T20:20:36Z		29		3	11		J Dev Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37489330 PMCID: PMC10366761					APC; EMT; GSK-3; Wnt; colon cancer; complement C3; cranial neural crest; craniofacial; mTOR; pharyngeal arch; splicing

HSPCs are produced in the embryo via transdifferentiation of haemogenic endothelial cells in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM). HSPCs in the AGM are heterogeneous in differentiation and proliferative output, but how these intrinsic differences are acquired remains unanswered. Here we discovered that loss of microRNA (miR)-128 in zebrafish leads to an expansion of HSPCs in the AGM with different cell cycle states and a skew towards erythroid and lymphoid progenitors. Manipulating miR-128 in differentiating haemogenic endothelial cells, before their transition to HSPCs, recapitulated the lineage skewing in both zebrafish and human pluripotent stem cells. miR-128 promotes Wnt and Notch signalling in the AGM via post-transcriptional repression of the Wnt inhibitor csnk1a1 and the Notch ligand jag1b. De-repression of cskn1a1 resulted in replicative and erythroid-biased HSPCs, whereas de-repression of jag1b resulted in G2/M and lymphoid-biased HSPCs with long-term consequence on the respective blood lineages. We propose that HSPC heterogeneity arises in the AGM endothelium and is programmed in part by Wnt and Notch signalling.	2023-08	2024-03-06 20:20:36	2024-03-06T20:20:36Z		1135-1145		8	25		Nat Cell Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37460694 PMCID: PMC10415179					Animals; Cell Differentiation; Endothelium; Hemangioblasts; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Zebrafish

Ancient vertebrate dermal armor evolved from trunk neural crest	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.2221120120		Bone is an evolutionary novelty of vertebrates, likely to have first emerged as part of ancestral dermal armor that consisted of osteogenic and odontogenic components. Whether these early vertebrate structures arose from mesoderm or neural crest cells has been a matter of considerable debate. To examine the developmental origin of the bony part of the dermal armor, we have performed in vivo lineage tracing in the sterlet sturgeon, a representative of nonteleost ray-finned fish that has retained an extensive postcranial dermal skeleton. The results definitively show that sterlet trunk neural crest cells give rise to osteoblasts of the scutes. Transcriptional profiling further reveals neural crest gene signature in sterlet scutes as well as bichir scales. Finally, histological and microCT analyses of ray-finned fish dermal armor show that their scales and scutes are formed by bone, dentin, and hypermineralized covering tissues, in various combinations, that resemble those of the first armored vertebrates. Taken together, our results support a primitive skeletogenic role for the neural crest along the entire body axis, that was later progressively restricted to the cranial region during vertebrate evolution. Thus, the neural crest was a crucial evolutionary innovation driving the origin and diversification of dermal armor along the entire body axis.	2023-07-25	2024-03-06 20:20:36	2024-03-06T20:20:36Z		e2221120120		30	120		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37459514 PMCID: PMC10372632					Animals; Biological Evolution; Fishes; Neural Crest; Osteogenesis; Skull; Vertebrates; neural crest; scales; skeleton; sterlet sturgeon; vertebrate evolution

To seek RNAs involved in the anxiety disorder-metabolic disorder link, we subjected zebrafish larvae to caffeine-induced anxiety or high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity followed by RNA sequencing and analyses. Notably, differentially expressed (DE) transcripts in these larval models and an adult zebrafish caffeine-induced anxiety model, as well as the transcript profiles of inherently anxious versus less anxious zebrafish strains and high-fat diet-fed versus standard diet-fed adult zebrafish, revealed inversely regulated DE transcripts. In both larval anxiety and obesity models, these included long noncoding RNAs and transfer RNA fragments, with the overrepresented immune system and inflammation pathways, e.g., the "interleukin signaling pathway" and "inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway". In adulthood, overrepresented immune system processes included "T cell activation", "leukocyte cell-cell adhesion", and "antigen processing and presentation". Furthermore, unlike adult zebrafish, obesity in larvae was not accompanied by anxiety-like behavior. Together, these results may reflect an antagonistic pleiotropic phenomenon involving a re-adjusted modulation of the anxiety-metabolic links with an occurrence of the acquired immune system. Furthermore, the HFD potential to normalize anxiety-upregulated immune-related genes may reflect the high-fat diet protection of anxiety and neurodegeneration reported by others.	2023-07-06	2024-03-06 20:20:35	2024-03-06T20:20:35Z		1794		13	12		Cells								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37443828 PMCID: PMC10341043					Animals; Anxiety; Caffeine; Inflammation; Larva; Obesity; RNA sequencing; Zebrafish; antagonistic pleiotropy; anxiety; caffeine; high-fat diet; immune system; noncoding RNA; obesity; transfer RNA fragments; zebrafish

The secreted neuronal signal Spock1 promotes blood-brain barrier development	Developmental Cell		1878-1551	10.1016/j.devcel.2023.06.005		The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a unique set of properties of the brain vasculature which severely restrict its permeability to proteins and small molecules. Classic chick-quail chimera studies have shown that these properties are not intrinsic to the brain vasculature but rather are induced by surrounding neural tissue. Here, we identify Spock1 as a candidate neuronal signal for regulating BBB permeability in zebrafish and mice. Mosaic genetic analysis shows that neuronally expressed Spock1 is cell non-autonomously required for a functional BBB. Leakage in spock1 mutants is associated with altered extracellular matrix (ECM), increased endothelial transcytosis, and altered pericyte-endothelial interactions. Furthermore, a single dose of recombinant SPOCK1 partially restores BBB function in spock1 mutants by quenching gelatinase activity and restoring vascular expression of BBB genes including mcamb. These analyses support a model in which neuronally secreted Spock1 initiates BBB properties by altering the ECM, thereby regulating pericyte-endothelial interactions and downstream vascular gene expression.	2023-09-11	2024-03-06 20:20:35	2024-03-06T20:20:35Z		1534-1547.e6		17	58		Dev Cell								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37437574 PMCID: PMC10525910					Animals; Biological Transport; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Endothelium; Mice; Proteoglycans; Zebrafish; blood vessel; blood-brain barrier; development; genetics; leakage; zebrafish

Sex blind: bridging the gap between drug exposure and sex-related gene expression in Danio rerio using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and a literature review to find the missing links in pharmaceutical and environmental toxicology studies	Frontiers in Toxicology		2673-3080	10.3389/ftox.2023.1187302		The sex of both humans and Danio rerio has previously been shown to affect the way individuals respond to drug exposure. Genes which allow identification of sex in juvenile zebrafish show potential to reveal these confounding variables between sex in toxicological and preclinical trials but the link between these is so far missing. These sex-specific, early expressed genes where expression is not altered by drug exposure must be carefully selected for this purpose. We aimed to discover genes which can be used in pharmaceutical trials and environmental toxicology studies to uncover sex-related variations in gene expression with drug application using the model organism Danio rerio. Previously published early sex determining genes from King et al. were evaluated as well as additional genes selected from our zebrafish Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data which are known from previously published works not to be susceptible to changes in expression with drug exposure. NGS revealed a further ten female-specific genes (vtg1, cyp17a1, cyp19a1a, igf3, ftz-f1, gdf9, foxl2a, Nr0b1, ipo4, lhcgr) and five male related candidate genes (FKBP5, apobb1, hbaa1, dmrt1, spata6) which are also expressed in juvenile zebrafish, 28 days post fertilisation (dpf). Following this, a literature review was performed to classify which of these early-expressed sex specific genes are already known to be affected by drug exposure in order to determine candidate genes to be used in pharmaceutical trials or environmental toxicology testing studies. Discovery of these early sex-determining genes in Danio rerio will allow identification of sex-related responses to drug testing to improve sex-specific healthcare and the medical treatment of human patients.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:35	2024-03-06T20:20:35Z		1187302			5		Front Toxicol	Sex blind							eng					PubMed		PMID: 37398910 PMCID: PMC10312089					drug influence; gene expression; human health; sex-variation; zebrafish

These receptors show specificity; unlike the broadly tuned receptors of the innate system, antibodies (Ig) expressed by B cells, for instance, can accurately distinguish between the two enantiomers of organic acids4, whereas T cell receptors (TCRs) reliably recognize single amino acid replacements in their peptide antigens5. In developing lymphocytes, antigen receptor genes are assembled from a comparatively small set of germline-encoded genetic elements in a process referred to as V(D)J recombination6,7. Potential self-reactivity of some antigen receptors arising from the quasi-random somatic diversification is suppressed by several robust control mechanisms8-12. For decades, scientists have puzzled over the evolutionary origin of somatically diversifying antigen receptors13-16. It has remained unclear how, at the inception of this mechanism, immunologically beneficial expanded receptor diversity was traded against the emerging risk of destructive self-recognition. Here we explore the hypothesis that in early vertebrates, sequence microhomologies marking the ends of recombining elements became the crucial targets of selection determining the outcome of non-homologous end joining-based repair of DNA double-strand breaks generated during RAG-mediated recombination. We find that, across the main clades of jawed vertebrates, TCRα repertoire diversity is best explained by species-specific extents of such sequence microhomologies. Thus, selection of germline sequence composition of rearranging elements emerges as a major factor determining the degree of diversity of somatically generated antigen receptors.	2023-07	2024-03-06 20:20:34	2024-03-06T20:20:34Z		193-200		7968	619		Nature								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37344590 PMCID: PMC10322711					Animals; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; DNA End-Joining Repair; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor; Genes, RAG-1; Lymphocytes; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta; Sequence Homology; Species Specificity; V(D)J Recombination; Vertebrates

The canonical eIF4E1A is required for cell viability, yet other related eIF4E families exist and are utilized in specific contexts or tissues. Here, we describe a family called Eif4e1c, for which we find roles during heart development and regeneration in zebrafish. The Eif4e1c family is present in all aquatic vertebrates but is lost in all terrestrial species. A core group of amino acids shared over 500 million years of evolution forms an interface along the protein surface, suggesting that Eif4e1c functions in a novel pathway. Deletion of eif4e1c in zebrafish caused growth deficits and impaired survival in juveniles. Mutants surviving to adulthood had fewer cardiomyocytes and reduced proliferative responses to cardiac injury. Ribosome profiling of mutant hearts demonstrated changes in translation efficiency of mRNA for genes known to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. Although eif4e1c is broadly expressed, its disruption had most notable impact on the heart and at juvenile stages. Our findings reveal context-dependent requirements for translation initiation regulators during heart regeneration.	2023-10-15	2024-03-06 20:20:34	2024-03-06T20:20:34Z		dev201376		20	150		Development								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37306388 PMCID: PMC10281269					Animals; Cell Proliferation; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E; Heart Injuries; Heart regeneration; Myocytes, Cardiac; Zebrafish; mRNA translation

Comparative analysis of transcriptional changes in zebrafish cep290 and bbs2 mutants by RNA-seq reveals upregulation of inflammatory and stress-related pathways	Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience		1662-5099	10.3389/fnmol.2023.1148840		Acute injury to the adult zebrafish retina triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that stimulate multiple gene regulatory networks, which ultimately stimulate Müller glia to proliferate and regenerate neurons. In contrast, zebrafish carrying mutations in cep290 or bbs2 undergo progressive loss of cone photoreceptors and exhibit signs of microglia activation and inflammation, but the mutants fail to stimulate a regeneration response. To identify transcriptional changes that occur in zebrafish mutants undergoing progressive photoreceptor degeneration, RNA-seq transcriptional profiling was performed on cep290-/- and bbs2-/- retinas. The PANTHER Classification System was used to identify biological processes and signaling pathways that were differentially expressed between mutants and wild-type siblings during degeneration. As expected, genes associated with phototransduction were downregulated in cep290 and bbs2 mutants compared to wild-type siblings. Although both cep290 and bbs2 mutants undergo proliferation of rod precursors in response to retinal degeneration, the process of negatively regulating proliferation is enriched for upregulated genes, and this negative regulation may restrict proliferation of Müller glia and inhibit regeneration. A total of 815 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were shared by cep290 and bbs2 retinas. Genes in pathways associated with inflammation, apoptosis, stress response, and PDGF signaling were overrepresented. Identifying the genes and biological pathways that are common in zebrafish models of inherited retinal degeneration provides a foundation for future studies on the mechanisms that regulate cell death as well as processes that prohibit Müller cell reprogramming or proliferation in a model capable of retinal regeneration. The pathways will provide targets for future interventions that may promote successful regeneration of lost photoreceptors.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:33	2024-03-06T20:20:33Z		1148840			16		Front Mol Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37293546 PMCID: PMC10244513					Müller cell 22; bbs2; cep290; regeneration; zebrafish

Lipid droplets are a metabolic vulnerability in melanoma	Nature Communications		2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-023-38831-9		Melanoma exhibits numerous transcriptional cell states including neural crest-like cells as well as pigmented melanocytic cells. How these different cell states relate to distinct tumorigenic phenotypes remains unclear. Here, we use a zebrafish melanoma model to identify a transcriptional program linking the melanocytic cell state to a dependence on lipid droplets, the specialized organelle responsible for lipid storage. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of these tumors show a concordance between genes regulating pigmentation and those involved in lipid and oxidative metabolism. This state is conserved across human melanoma cell lines and patient tumors. This melanocytic state demonstrates increased fatty acid uptake, an increased number of lipid droplets, and dependence upon fatty acid oxidative metabolism. Genetic and pharmacologic suppression of lipid droplet production is sufficient to disrupt cell cycle progression and slow melanoma growth in vivo. Because the melanocytic cell state is linked to poor outcomes in patients, these data indicate a metabolic vulnerability in melanoma that depends on the lipid droplet organelle.	2023-06-02	2024-03-06 20:20:33	2024-03-06T20:20:33Z		3192		1	14		Nat Commun								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37268606 PMCID: PMC10238408					Animals; Fatty Acids; Humans; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Zebrafish

Automated time-lapse data segmentation reveals in vivo cell state dynamics	Science Advances		2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.adf1814		Embryonic development proceeds as a series of orderly cell state transitions built upon noisy molecular processes. We defined gene expression and cell motion states using single-cell RNA sequencing data and in vivo time-lapse cell tracking data of the zebrafish tailbud. We performed a parallel identification of these states using dimensional reduction methods and a change point detection algorithm. Both types of cell states were quantitatively mapped onto embryos, and we used the cell motion states to study the dynamics of biological state transitions over time. The time average pattern of cell motion states is reproducible among embryos. However, individual embryos exhibit transient deviations from the time average forming left-right asymmetries in collective cell motion. Thus, the reproducible pattern of cell states and bilateral symmetry arise from temporal averaging. In addition, collective cell behavior can be a source of asymmetry rather than a buffer against noisy individual cell behavior.	2023-06-02	2024-03-06 20:20:33	2024-03-06T20:20:33Z		eadf1814		22	9		Sci Adv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37267354 PMCID: PMC10413672					Animals; Cell Tracking; Embryonic Development; Time-Lapse Imaging; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

The entire organ develops from the otic placode, which itself originates from the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD). Multiple studies in various species have shown the importance of the forkhead-box and distal-less homeodomain transcription factor families for OEPD and subsequent otic placode formation. However, the transcriptional networks downstream of these factors are only beginning to be understood. Using transcriptome analysis, we here reveal numerous genes regulated by the distal-less homeodomain transcription factors Dlx3b and Dlx4b (Dlx3b/4b). We identify known and novel transcripts displaying widespread OEPD expression in a Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner. Some genes, with a known OEPD expression in other vertebrate species, might be members of a presumptive vertebrate core module required for proper otic development. Moreover, we identify genes controlling early-born sensory hair cell formation as well as regulating biomineral tissue development, both consistent with defective sensory hair cell and otolith formation observed in dlx3b/4b mutants. Finally, we show that ectopic Atoh1b expression can rescue early sensorigenesis even in the absence of Dlx3b/4b. Taken together, our data will help to unravel the gene regulatory network underlying early inner ear development and provide insights into the molecular control of vertebrate inner ear formation to restore hearing loss in humans ultimately.	2023-06-15	2024-03-06 20:20:33	2024-03-06T20:20:33Z		bio059911		6	12		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37272628 PMCID: PMC10261724					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9; Development; Ear, Inner; Gene Expression Profiling; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Inner ear; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome analysis; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Defining function of wild-type and three patient-specific TP53 mutations in a zebrafish model of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.68221		In embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and generally in sarcomas, the role of wild-type and loss- or gain-of-function TP53 mutations remains largely undefined. Eliminating mutant or restoring wild-type p53 is challenging; nevertheless, understanding p53 variant effects on tumorigenesis remains central to realizing better treatment outcomes. In ERMS, >70% of patients retain wild-type TP53, yet mutations when present are associated with worse prognosis. Employing a kRASG12D-driven ERMS tumor model and tp53 null (tp53-/-) zebrafish, we define wild-type and patient-specific TP53 mutant effects on tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that tp53 is a major suppressor of tumorigenesis, where tp53 loss expands tumor initiation from <35% to >97% of animals. Characterizing three patient-specific alleles reveals that TP53C176F partially retains wild-type p53 apoptotic activity that can be exploited, whereas TP53P153Δ and TP53Y220C encode two structurally related proteins with gain-of-function effects that predispose to head musculature ERMS. TP53P153Δ unexpectedly also predisposes to hedgehog-expressing medulloblastomas in the kRASG12D-driven ERMS-model.	2023-06-02	2024-03-06 20:20:32	2024-03-06T20:20:32Z		e68221			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37266578 PMCID: PMC10322150					Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cerebellar Neoplasms; Mutation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal; TP53; TP53C176F; TP53P153Δ; TP53Y220C; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Zebrafish; cancer biology; mutant tp53; rare varients; rhabdomyosarcoma; tumor initiation; zebrafish

Therefore, we conducted a developmental toxicity evaluation on zebrafish embryos exposed to PFBS and PFOS and assessed neurobehavioral changes at concentrations below each point of departure (POD) determined by embryonic mortality. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, biomolecular perturbations in response to PFBS were profiled and then integrated for comparison with those for PFOS. Although PFBS (7525.47 μM POD) was approximately 700 times less toxic than PFOS (11.42 μM POD), altered neurobehavior patterns and affected kinds of endogenous neurochemicals were similar between PFBS and PFOS at the corresponding POD-based concentrations. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the PFBS neurotoxicity mechanism was associated with oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and glycolysis/glucogenesis. The commonalities in developmental neurotoxicity-related mechanisms between PFBS and PFOS interconnected by knowledge-based integration of multi-omics included the calcium signaling pathway, lipid homeostasis, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Despite being less toxic than PFOS, PFBS exhibited similar dysregulated molecular mechanisms, suggesting that chain length differences do not affect the intrinsic toxicity mechanism. Overall, carefully managing potential toxicity of PFBS can secure its status as an alternative to PFOS.	2023-09-05	2024-03-06 20:20:32	2024-03-06T20:20:32Z		131714			457		J Hazard Mater								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37263023					Alkanesulfonic Acids; Alternative; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Legacy; Molecular mechanism; Multiomics; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Point of departure; Zebrafish

Studies on flrt2 have focused mainly on its roles in the brain, heart and chondrogenesis. However, reports on its expression and function in the zebrafish retina are lacking. Here, we detected the high expression of flrt2 in zebrafish retina using in situ hybridization technique and developed an flrt2-knockout (KO) zebrafish line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression levels of flrt2, which results in an approximately 60% mRNA reduction. The flrt2-KO zebrafish eyes' altered morphological, cellular, and molecular events were identified using BrdU labeling, TUNEL assay, immunofluorescent staining, fluorescent dye injection and RNA sequencing. Abnormal eye development, known as microphthalmia, was found in flrt2-KO larvae, and the retinal progenitor cells exhibited increased apoptosis, perhaps owing to the combined effects of crx, neurod4, atoh7, and pcdh8 downregulation and Casp3a and Caspbl upregulation. In contrast, the retinal neural development, as well as retinal progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation, were not affected by the flrt2 deletion. Thus, flrt2 appears to play important roles in retinal development and function, which may provide the basis for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms of retinal development and evolution.	2023-06-15	2024-03-06 20:20:31	2024-03-06T20:20:31Z		bio059784		6	12		Biol Open								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37259881 PMCID: PMC10281255					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9; Fibronectins; Leucine; Membrane Glycoproteins; Microphthalmia; Microphthalmos; Retinal; Zebrafish; flrt2

We aimed to establish a znf469 mutant zebrafish line to explore its roles and possible pathogenic mechanism in cornea development and disorder. METHODS: znf4694del/4del mutant zebrafish was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to examine the phenotype of the cornea in different developmental stages. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to reveal the molecular mechanism. RESULTS: Macroscopically, homozygous znf469 mutant zebrafish larvae exhibited a curved body from 72 hours postfertilization, similar to kyphoscoliosis, and a noninflated swimbladder at 7 days postfertilization (dpf). TEM revealed an extreme reduction of corneal stroma thickness in homozygous znf469 mutant zebrafish in both the central and peripheral cornea from the early development stage. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated that the znf469 mutation leads to the decreased synthesis of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagens and proteoglycans, but increased synthesis of 26S proteasome family members. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our work indicate that znf469 is a critical gene that, as a widely considered transcription factor, may regulate the synthesis and degradation of a large number of ECM components that play an important role in corneal development.	2023-05-01	2024-03-06 20:20:31	2024-03-06T20:20:31Z		29		5	64		Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	Znf469 Plays a Critical Role in Regulating Synthesis of ECM							eng					PubMed		PMID: 37256609 PMCID: PMC10233312					Animals; Cornea; Disease Models, Animal; Eye Abnormalities; Skin Abnormalities; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins

Our laboratory established a late-onset IS model in zebrafish (Danio rerio) containing a deletion in kif7. A total of 25% of kif7co63/co63 zebrafish develop spinal curvatures and are otherwise developmentally normal, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the scoliosis are unknown. To define transcripts associated with scoliosis in this model, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing on 6 weeks past fertilization (wpf) kif7co63/co63 zebrafish with and without scoliosis. Additionally, we sequenced kif7co63/co63, kif7co63/+, and AB zebrafish (n = 3 per genotype). Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCz11 genome and FPKM values were calculated. Differences between groups were calculated for each transcript by the t-test. Principal component analysis showed that transcriptomes clustered by sample age and genotype. kif7 mRNA was mildly reduced in both homozygous and heterozygous zebrafish compared to AB. Sonic hedgehog target genes were upregulated in kif7co63/co63 zebrafish over AB, but no difference was detected between scoliotic and non-scoliotic mutants. The top upregulated genes in scoliotic zebrafish were cytoskeletal keratins. Pankeratin staining of 6 wpf scoliotic and non-scoliotic kif7co63/co63 zebrafish showed increased keratin levels within the zebrafish musculature and intervertebral disc (IVD). Keratins are major components of the embryonic notochord, and aberrant keratin expression has been associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) in both zebrafish and humans. The role of increased keratin accumulation as a molecular mechanism associated with the onset of scoliosis warrants further study.	2023-05-09	2024-03-06 20:20:31	2024-03-06T20:20:31Z		1058		5	14		Genes (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37239418 PMCID: PMC10218407					Animals; Hedgehog Proteins; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; KIF7; Keratins; Kinesins; RNA sequencing; Scoliosis; Zebrafish; genetics; histology; idiopathic scoliosis; intervertebral disc degeneration; keratin; spine; transcriptomics; zebrafish

Heat induces multiomic and phenotypic stress propagation in zebrafish embryos	PNAS nexus		2752-6542	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad137		Heat alters biology from molecular to ecological levels, but may also have unknown indirect effects. This includes the concept that animals exposed to abiotic stress can induce stress in naive receivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular signatures of this process, by integrating multiomic and phenotypic data. In individual zebrafish embryos, repeated heat peaks elicited both a molecular response and a burst of accelerated growth followed by a growth slowdown in concert with reduced responses to novel stimuli. Metabolomes of the media of heat treated vs. untreated embryos revealed candidate stress metabolites including sulfur-containing compounds and lipids. These stress metabolites elicited transcriptomic changes in naive receivers related to immune response, extracellular signaling, glycosaminoglycan/keratan sulfate, and lipid metabolism. Consequently, non-heat-exposed receivers (exposed to stress metabolites only) experienced accelerated catch-up growth in concert with reduced swimming performance. The combination of heat and stress metabolites accelerated development the most, mediated by apelin signaling. Our results prove the concept of indirect heat-induced stress propagation toward naive receivers, inducing phenotypes comparable with those resulting from direct heat exposure, but utilizing distinct molecular pathways. Group-exposing a nonlaboratory zebrafish line, we independently confirm that the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-related gene chs1 and the mucus glycoprotein gene prg4a, functionally connected to the candidate stress metabolite classes sugars and phosphocholine, are differentially expressed in receivers. This hints at the production of Schreckstoff-like cues in receivers, leading to further stress propagation within groups, which may have ecological and animal welfare implications for aquatic populations in a changing climate.	2023-05	2024-03-06 20:20:30	2024-03-06T20:20:30Z		pgad137		5	2		PNAS Nexus								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37228511 PMCID: PMC10205475					multiomics; stress cues; stress propagation; stress response; thermal stress

Mutation of vsx genes in zebrafish highlights the robustness of the retinal specification network	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.85594		Genetic studies in human and mice have established a dual role for Vsx genes in retina development: an early function in progenitors' specification, and a later requirement for bipolar-cells fate determination. Despite their conserved expression patterns, it is currently unclear to which extent Vsx functions are also conserved across vertebrates, as mutant models are available only in mammals. To gain insight into vsx function in teleosts, we have generated vsx1 and vsx2 CRISPR/Cas9 double knockouts (vsxKO) in zebrafish. Our electrophysiological and histological analyses indicate severe visual impairment and bipolar cells depletion in vsxKO larvae, with retinal precursors being rerouted toward photoreceptor or Müller glia fates. Surprisingly, neural retina is properly specified and maintained in mutant embryos, which do not display microphthalmia. We show that although important cis-regulatory remodelling occurs in vsxKO retinas during early specification, this has little impact at a transcriptomic level. Our observations point to genetic redundancy as an important mechanism sustaining the integrity of the retinal specification network, and to Vsx genes regulatory weight varying substantially among vertebrate species.	2023-05-25	2024-03-06 20:20:30	2024-03-06T20:20:30Z		e85594			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37227126 PMCID: PMC10212559					Animals; CRISPR/Cas9; Eye Proteins; Genes, Homeobox; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Mammals; Mice; Mutation; Retina; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; bipolar cells specification; developmental biology; evolutionary biology; medaka; medaka retina; neural retina network; vsx genes; zebrafish; zebrafish retina

A CRISPR-Cas9 mutation in sox9b long intergenic noncoding RNA (slincR) affects zebrafish development, behavior, and regeneration	Toxicological Sciences: An Official Journal of the Society of Toxicology		1096-0929	10.1093/toxsci/kfad050		The role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulators of toxicological responses to environmental chemicals is gaining prominence. Previously, our laboratory discovered an lncRNA, sox9b long intergenic noncoding RNA (slincR), that is activated by multiple ligands of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Within this study, we designed a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated slincR zebrafish mutant line to better understand its biological function in presence or absence of a model AHR ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The slincRosu3 line contains an 18 bp insertion within the slincR sequence that changes its predicted mRNA secondary structure. Toxicological profiling showed that slincRosu3 is equally or more sensitive to TCDD for morphological and behavioral phenotypes. Embryonic mRNA-sequencing showed differential responses of 499 or 908 genes in slincRosu3 in absence or presence of TCDD Specifically, unexposed slincRosu3 embryos showed disruptions in metabolic pathways, suggesting an endogenous role for slincR. slincRosu3 embryos also had repressed mRNA levels of sox9b-a transcription factor that slincR is known to negatively regulate. Hence, we studied cartilage development and regenerative capacity-both processes partially regulated by sox9b. Cartilage development was disrupted in slincRosu3 embryos both in presence and absence of TCDD. slincRosu3 embryos also displayed a lack of regenerative capacity of amputated tail fins, accompanied by a lack of cell proliferation. In summary, using a novel slincR mutant line, we show that a mutation in slincR can have widespread impacts on gene expression and structural development endogenously and limited, but significant impacts in presence of AHR induction that further highlights its importance in the developmental process.	2023-07-28	2024-03-06 20:20:29	2024-03-06T20:20:29Z		153-166		2	194		Toxicol Sci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37220911 PMCID: PMC10375313					Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; CRISPR-Cas9; Mutation; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Regeneration; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; lncRNA; noncoding RNA; regeneration; zebrafish

Microenvironmental control of hematopoietic stem cell fate via CXCL8 and protein kinase C	Cell Reports		2211-1247	10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112528		Altered hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate underlies primary blood disorders but microenvironmental factors controlling this are poorly understood. Genetically barcoded genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) zebrafish were used to screen for factors expressed by the sinusoidal vascular niche that alter the phylogenetic distribution of the HSC pool under native conditions. Dysregulated expression of protein kinase C delta (PKC-δ, encoded by prkcda) increases the number of HSC clones by up to 80% and expands polyclonal populations of immature neutrophil and erythroid precursors. PKC agonists such as cxcl8 augment HSC competition for residency within the niche and expand defined niche populations. CXCL8 induces association of PKC-δ with the focal adhesion complex, activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and expression of niche factors in human endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate the existence of reserve capacity within the niche that is controlled by CXCL8 and PKC and has significant impact on HSC phylogenetic and phenotypic fate.	2023-05-30	2024-03-06 20:20:29	2024-03-06T20:20:29Z		112528		5	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37209097 PMCID: PMC10824047					Animals; CP: Stem cell research; Endothelial Cells; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Interleukin-8; Phylogeny; Protein Kinase C-delta; Stem Cell Niche; Zebrafish; hematopoiesis, CXCL8, PKC, barcoding, lineage tracing, zebrafish, vascular niche, hematopoietic niche, microenvironment, clonality

The KEAP1-NRF2 pathway regulates TFEB/TFE3-dependent lysosomal biogenesis	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America		1091-6490	10.1073/pnas.2217425120		The maintenance of redox and metabolic homeostasis is integral to embryonic development. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a stress-induced transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of redox balance and cellular metabolism. Under homeostatic conditions, NRF2 is repressed by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Here, we demonstrate that Keap1 deficiency induces Nrf2 activation and postdevelopmental lethality. Loss of viability is preceded by severe liver abnormalities characterized by an accumulation of lysosomes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that loss of Keap1 promotes aberrant activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB)/transcription factor binding to IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3)-dependent lysosomal biogenesis. Importantly, we find that NRF2-dependent regulation of lysosomal biogenesis is cell autonomous and evolutionarily conserved. These studies identify a role for the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway in the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and suggest that maintenance of lysosomal homeostasis is required during embryonic development.	2023-05-30	2024-03-06 20:20:29	2024-03-06T20:20:29Z		e2217425120		22	120		Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37216554 PMCID: PMC10235939					Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; KEAP1; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; Lysosomes; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; NRF2; TFEB/TFE3; lysosome; zebrafish

Nanoparticle-based targeting of microglia improves the neural regeneration enhancing effects of immunosuppression in the zebrafish retina	Communications Biology		2399-3642	10.1038/s42003-023-04898-9		Retinal Müller glia function as injury-induced stem-like cells in zebrafish but not mammals. However, insights gleaned from zebrafish have been applied to stimulate nascent regenerative responses in the mammalian retina. For instance, microglia/macrophages regulate Müller glia stem cell activity in the chick, zebrafish, and mouse. We previously showed that post-injury immunosuppression by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone accelerated retinal regeneration kinetics in zebrafish. Similarly, microglia ablation enhances regenerative outcomes in the mouse retina. Targeted immunomodulation of microglia reactivity may therefore enhance the regenerative potential of Müller glia for therapeutic purposes. Here, we investigated potential mechanisms by which post-injury dexamethasone accelerates retinal regeneration kinetics, and the effects of dendrimer-based targeting of dexamethasone to reactive microglia. Intravital time-lapse imaging revealed that post-injury dexamethasone inhibited microglia reactivity. The dendrimer-conjugated formulation: (1) decreased dexamethasone-associated systemic toxicity, (2) targeted dexamethasone to reactive microglia, and (3) improved the regeneration enhancing effects of immunosuppression by increasing stem/progenitor proliferation rates. Lastly, we show that the gene rnf2 is required for the enhanced regeneration effect of D-Dex. These data support the use of dendrimer-based targeting of reactive immune cells to reduce toxicity and enhance the regeneration promoting effects of immunosuppressants in the retina.	2023-05-18	2024-03-06 20:20:28	2024-03-06T20:20:28Z		534		1	6		Commun Biol								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37202450 PMCID: PMC10193316					Animals; Dendrimers; Dexamethasone; Immunosuppression Therapy; Mammals; Mice; Microglia; Retina; Zebrafish

Atm also serves non-canonical functions in the response to oxidative stress and chromatin reorganization. We previously reported that overexpression of the epigenetic regulator and oncogene Ubiquitin Like with PHD and Ring Finger Domains 1 (UHRF1) in zebrafish hepatocytes resulted in tp53-dependent hepatocyte senescence, a small liver and larval lethality. We investigated the role of atm on UHRF1-mediated phenotypes by generating zebrafish atm mutants. atm-/- adults were viable but had reduction in fertility. Embryos developed normally but were protected from lethality caused by etoposide or H2O2 exposure and failed to fully upregulate Tp53 targets or oxidative stress response genes in response to these treatments. In contrast to the finding that Tp53 prevents the small liver phenotype caused by UHRF1 overexpression, atm mutation and exposure to H2O2 further reduced the liver size in UHRF1 overexpressing larvae whereas treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine suppressed this phenotype. We conclude that UHRF1 overexpression in hepatocytes causes oxidative stress, and that loss of atm further enhances this, triggering elimination of these precancerous cells, leading to a small liver.	2023-04-14	2024-03-06 20:20:28	2024-03-06T20:20:28Z		2302		8	15		Cancers (Basel)								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37190230 PMCID: PMC10136906					Tp53; UHRF1; ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; atm; liver; oxidative stress; zebrafish

Nr2f1a maintains atrial nkx2.5 expression to repress pacemaker identity within venous atrial cardiomyocytes of zebrafish	eLife		2050-084X	10.7554/eLife.77408		Maintenance of cardiomyocyte identity is vital for normal heart development and function. However, our understanding of cardiomyocyte plasticity remains incomplete. Here, we show that sustained expression of the zebrafish transcription factor Nr2f1a prevents the progressive acquisition of ventricular cardiomyocyte (VC) and pacemaker cardiomyocyte (PC) identities within distinct regions of the atrium. Transcriptomic analysis of flow-sorted atrial cardiomyocytes (ACs) from nr2f1a mutant zebrafish embryos showed increased VC marker gene expression and altered expression of core PC regulatory genes, including decreased expression of nkx2.5, a critical repressor of PC differentiation. At the arterial (outflow) pole of the atrium in nr2f1a mutants, cardiomyocytes resolve to VC identity within the expanded atrioventricular canal. However, at the venous (inflow) pole of the atrium, there is a progressive wave of AC transdifferentiation into PCs across the atrium toward the arterial pole. Restoring Nkx2.5 is sufficient to repress PC marker identity in nr2f1a mutant atria and analysis of chromatin accessibility identified an Nr2f1a-dependent nkx2.5 enhancer expressed in the atrial myocardium directly adjacent to PCs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the putative nkx2.5 enhancer leads to a loss of Nkx2.5-expressing ACs and expansion of a PC reporter, supporting that Nr2f1a limits PC differentiation within venous ACs via maintaining nkx2.5 expression. The Nr2f-dependent maintenance of AC identity within discrete atrial compartments may provide insights into the molecular etiology of concurrent structural congenital heart defects and associated arrhythmias.	2023-05-15	2024-03-06 20:20:27	2024-03-06T20:20:27Z		e77408			12		Elife								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37184369 PMCID: PMC10185342					Animals; Atrial Fibrillation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5; Homeodomain Proteins; Myocytes, Cardiac; Nkx2.5 transcription factor; Nr2f transcription factor; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins; atrial cardiomyocytes; cell biology; cellular plasticity; developmental biology; heart development; pacemaker cardiomyocyte; zebrafish

Thomas	Genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma results from a regulatory polymorphism that promotes the adrenergic cell state	The Journal of Clinical Investigation		1558-8238	10.1172/JCI166919		Childhood neuroblastomas exhibit plasticity between an undifferentiated neural crest-like mesenchymal cell state and a more differentiated sympathetic adrenergic cell state. These cell states are governed by autoregulatory transcriptional loops called core regulatory circuitries (CRCs), which drive the early development of sympathetic neuronal progenitors from migratory neural crest cells during embryogenesis. The adrenergic cell identity of neuroblastoma requires LMO1 as a transcriptional cofactor. Both LMO1 expression levels and the risk of developing neuroblastoma in children are associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism, G/T, that affects a GATA motif in the first intron of LMO1. Here, we showed that WT zebrafish with the GATA genotype developed adrenergic neuroblastoma, while knock-in of the protective TATA allele at this locus reduced the penetrance of MYCN-driven tumors, which were restricted to the mesenchymal cell state. Whole genome sequencing of childhood neuroblastomas demonstrated that TATA/TATA tumors also exhibited a mesenchymal cell state and were low risk at diagnosis. Thus, conversion of the regulatory GATA to a TATA allele in the first intron of LMO1 reduced the neuroblastoma-initiation rate by preventing formation of the adrenergic cell state. This mechanism was conserved over 400 million years of evolution, separating zebrafish and humans.	2023-05-15	2024-03-06 20:20:27	2024-03-06T20:20:27Z		e166919		10	133		J Clin Invest								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37183825 PMCID: PMC10178836					Adrenergic Agents; Animals; Child; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic variation; Genetics; Genotype; Humans; Molecular genetics; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Oncology; Zebrafish

A zebrafish model of combined saposin deficiency identifies acid sphingomyelinase as a potential therapeutic target	Disease Models & Mechanisms		1754-8411	10.1242/dmm.049995		Sphingolipidoses are a subcategory of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by mutations in enzymes of the sphingolipid catabolic pathway. Like many LSDs, neurological involvement in sphingolipidoses leads to early mortality with limited treatment options. Given the role of myelin loss as a major contributor toward LSD-associated neurodegeneration, we investigated the pathways contributing to demyelination in a CRISPR-Cas9-generated zebrafish model of combined saposin (psap) deficiency. psap knockout (KO) zebrafish recapitulated major LSD pathologies, including reduced lifespan, reduced lipid storage, impaired locomotion and severe myelin loss; loss of myelin basic protein a (mbpa) mRNA was progressive, with no changes in additional markers of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Brain transcriptomics revealed dysregulated mTORC1 signaling and elevated neuroinflammation, where increased proinflammatory cytokine expression preceded and mTORC1 signaling changes followed mbpa loss. We examined pharmacological and genetic rescue strategies via water tank administration of the multiple sclerosis drug monomethylfumarate (MMF), and crossing the psap KO line into an acid sphingomyelinase (smpd1) deficiency model. smpd1 mutagenesis, but not MMF treatment, prolonged lifespan in psap KO zebrafish, highlighting the modulation of acid sphingomyelinase activity as a potential path toward sphingolipidosis treatment.	2023-07-01	2024-03-06 20:20:27	2024-03-06T20:20:27Z		dmm049995		7	16		Dis Model Mech								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37183607 PMCID: PMC10320721					Animals; Lipidomics; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Lysosomal storage disease; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Saposins; Sphingolipidoses; Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase; Zebrafish

One remarkable property of metaphocytes is their ability to capture soluble antigens from the external environment via transepithelial protrusions, a unique function manifested by specialized subpopulations of the TRMs/DCs in mammal barrier tissues. Yet, how metaphocytes acquire myeloid-like cell properties from non-hematopoietic precursors and how they regulate barrier immunity remains unknown. Here, we show that metaphocytes are in situ generated from local progenitors guided by the ETS transcription factor Spic, the deficiency of which results in the absence of metaphocytes. We further document that metaphocytes are the major IL-22BP-producing cells, and the depletion of metaphocytes causes dysregulated barrier immunity that resembles the phenotype of IL-22BP-deficient mice. These findings reveal the ontogeny, development, and function of metaphocytes in zebrafish, which facilitates our understanding of the nature and function of the mammalian TRM/DC counterparts.	2023-05-30	2024-03-06 20:20:26	2024-03-06T20:20:26Z		112483		5	42		Cell Rep								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37148242					Animals; CP: Immunology; Cell Differentiation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dendritic Cells; Mammals; Mice; Receptors, Interleukin; Zebrafish

L.; Bruggmann, Rémy; Jaźwińska, Anna	The regeneration-responsive element careg monitors activation of Müller glia after MNU-induced damage of photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina	Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience		1662-5099	10.3389/fnmol.2023.1160707		In contrast to mammals, zebrafish can regenerate their damaged photoreceptors. This capacity depends on the intrinsic plasticity of Müller glia (MG). Here, we identified that the transgenic reporter careg, a marker of regenerating fin and heart, also participates in retina restoration in zebrafish. After methylnitrosourea (MNU) treatment, the retina became deteriorated and contained damaged cell types including rods, UV-sensitive cones and the outer plexiform layer. This phenotype was associated with the induction of careg expression in a subset of MG until the reconstruction of the photoreceptor synaptic layer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of regenerating retinas revealed a population of immature rods, defined by high expression of rhodopsin and the ciliogenesis gene meig1, but low expression of phototransduction genes. Furthermore, cones displayed deregulation of metabolic and visual perception genes in response to retina injury. Comparison between careg:EGFP expressing and non-expressing MG demonstrated that these two subpopulations are characterized by distinct molecular signatures, suggesting their heterogenous responsiveness to the regenerative program. Dynamics of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation showed that TOR signaling became progressively switched from MG to progenitors. Inhibition of TOR with rapamycin reduced the cell cycle activity, but neither affected careg:EGFP expression in MG, nor prevented restoration of the retina structure. This indicates that MG reprogramming, and progenitor cell proliferation might be regulated by distinct mechanisms. In conclusion, the careg reporter detects activated MG, and provides a common marker of regeneration-competent cells in diverse zebrafish organs, including the retina.	2023	2024-03-06 20:20:26	2024-03-06T20:20:26Z		1160707			16		Front Mol Neurosci								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37138703 PMCID: PMC10149768					MNU-injury; Müller glia; TOR; cones; rapamycin; regeneration enhancer; retina regeneration; rods

However, systematically dissecting the underlying regulation of mRNA transcription and degradation remains a challenge, especially within whole embryos with diverse cellular identities. Here, we collect temporal cellular transcriptomes of zebrafish embryos, and decompose them into their newly-transcribed (zygotic) and pre-existing (maternal) mRNA components by combining single-cell RNA-Seq and metabolic labeling. We introduce kinetic models capable of quantifying regulatory rates of mRNA transcription and degradation within individual cell types during their specification. These reveal different regulatory rates between thousands of genes, and sometimes between cell types, that shape spatio-temporal expression patterns. Transcription drives most cell-type restricted gene expression. However, selective retention of maternal transcripts helps to define the gene expression profiles of germ cells and enveloping layer cells, two of the earliest specified cell-types. Coordination between transcription and degradation restricts expression of maternal-zygotic genes to specific cell types or times, and allows the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns when overall mRNA levels are held relatively constant. Sequence-based analysis links differences in degradation to specific sequence motifs. Our study reveals mRNA transcription and degradation events that control embryonic gene expression, and provides a quantitative approach to study mRNA regulation during a dynamic spatio-temporal response.	2023-04-21	2024-03-06 20:20:26	2024-03-06T20:20:26Z		2023.04.20.537620					bioRxiv								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37131717 PMCID: PMC10153228

Most of the numerous studies of these compounds deal with single chemicals, although real exposures always consist of mixtures. Thus, using different tests, we screened the effects on zebrafish larvae caused by exposure to an environmentally relevant POP mixture. Our mixture consisted of 29 chemicals as found in the blood of a Scandinavian human population. Larvae exposed to this POP mix at realistic concentrations, or sub-mixtures thereof, presented growth retardation, edemas, retarded swim bladder inflation, hyperactive swimming behavior, and other striking malformations such as microphthalmia. The most deleterious compounds in the mixture belong to the per- and polyfluorinated acids class, although chlorinated and brominated compounds modulated the effects. Analyzing the changes in transcriptome caused by POP exposure, we observed an increase of insulin signaling and identified genes involved in brain and eye development, leading us to propose that the impaired function of the condensin I complex caused the observed eye defect. Our findings contribute to the understanding of POP mixtures, their consequences, and potential threats to human and animal populations, indicating that more mechanistic, monitoring, and long-term studies are imperative.	2023-04-09	2024-03-06 20:20:26	2024-03-06T20:20:26Z		357		4	11		Toxics								eng					PubMed		PMID: 37112584 PMCID: PMC10146850					PFOS; POP; SVHC; behavior; condensin I; development; persistent organic pollutants; zebrafish																																														﻿"Key"	Item Type	Publication Year	Author	Title	Publication Title	ISBN	ISSN	DOI	Url	Abstract Note	Date	Date Added	Date Modified	Access Date	Pages	Num Pages	Issue	Volume	Number Of Volumes	Journal Abbreviation	Short Title	Series	Series Number	Series Text	Series Title	Publisher	Place	Language	Rights	Type	Archive	Archive Location	Library Catalog	Call Number	Extra	Notes	File Attachments	Link Attachments	Manual Tags	Automatic Tags	Editor	Series Editor	Translator	Contributor	Attorney Agent	Book Author	Cast Member	Commenter	Composer	Cosponsor	Counsel	Interviewer	Producer	Recipient	Reviewed Author	Scriptwriter	Words By	Guest	Number	Edition	Running Time	Scale	Medium	Artwork Size	Filing Date	Application Number	Assignee	Issuing Authority	Country	Meeting Name	Conference Name	Court	References	Reporter	Legal Status	Priority Numbers	Programming Language	Version	System	Code	Code Number	Section	Session	Committee	History	Legislative Body

However, knockout of                cyp17a1                , a key enzyme responsible for the androgen synthesis, in                ar                -/- male zebrafish paradoxically causes testicular hypertrophy and enhanced spermatogenesis. Because Cyp17a1 plays key roles in hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone (P4), and converts 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione, we hypothesize that the unexpected phenotype in                cyp17a1                -/-;                androgen receptor                (                ar                )-/- zebrafish may be mediated through an augmentation of progestin/nuclear progestin receptor (nPgr) signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we show that knockout of                cyp17a1                leads to accumulation of 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and P4. Further, administration of progestin, a synthetic DHP mimetic, is sufficient to rescue testicular development and spermatogenesis in                ar                -/- zebrafish, whereas knockout of                npgr                abolishes the rescue effect of                cyp17a1                -/- in the                cyp17a1                -/-;                ar                -/- double mutant.

TXJS5AXR	report	2021	Lopez, Mark Louie D.; Lin, Ya-ying; Schneider, Stephan Q.; Machida, Ryuji J.	Allometric scaling of RNA abundance from genes to communities				10.1101/2021.10.03.462954	http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.10.03.462954	Abstract            The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and growth rate hypothesis (GRH) help explain the mechanistic basis of size (allometry) and temperature dependence on growth rate and whole-body-RNA content in organisms. However, testing RNA allometric scaling with next-generation sequencing is yet to be done. Here, we validated the assumptions of GRH and MTE on messenger RNA and ribosome abundance using mock community metatranscriptome analysis. Our findings highlight that fast-growing smaller species harbor greater RNA abundance per mass of tissue compared with species having larger body sizes and slower growth rates, where allometric slopes for genomic and gene-level RNA abundance range from –⅓ to −1. We found that genome size and body size impose significant constraints in interspecific RNA abundance scaling, while the assumed temperature dependence appeared to be weak. Lastly, allometric scaling integration in community-level models may extend the use of metatranscriptomics as a reliable tool for estimating ecosystem processes.	2021-10-04	2024-03-06 20:29:43	2024-03-06T20:29:43Z	2024-03-06 20:29:43												Ecology		en		preprint			DOI.org (Crossref)		DOI: 10.1101/2021.10.03.462954																																																																																																																																									
MNQQTVH8	journalArticle	2022	Zhang, Zhicong; Ji, Fengyu; Jiang, Shouwen; Wu, Zhichao; Xu, Qianghua	Scale Development-Related Genes Identified by Transcriptome Analysis	Fishes		2410-3888	10.3390/fishes7020064	https://www.mdpi.com/2410-3888/7/2/64	Scales, as key structures of fish skin, play an important role in physiological function. The study of fish scale development mechanisms provides a basis for exploring the molecular-level developmental differences between scaled and non-scaled fishes. In this study, alizarin red staining was used to divide the different stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) scale development. Four developmental stages, namely stage I (~17 dpf, scales have not started to grow), stage II (~33 dpf, the point at which scales start to grow), stage III (~41 dpf, the period in which the scales almost cover the whole body), and stage IV (~3 mpf, scales cover the whole body), were determined and used for subsequent transcriptome analysis. WGCNA (weighted correlation network analysis) and DEG (differentially expressed gene) analysis were used for screening the key genes. Based on the comparison between stage II and stage I, 54 hub-genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Key genes including the Scpp family (Scpp7, Scpp6, Scpp5, and Scpp8), the Fgf family (Fgfr1b and Fgfr3), Tcf7, Wnt10b, Runx2b, and Il2rb were identified by DEG analysis, which indicated that these genes played important roles in the key nodes of scale development signal pathways. Combined with this analysis, the TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, and FGF signaling pathways were suggested to be the most important signal pathways for scales starting to grow. This study laid a foundation for exploring the scale development mechanism of other fishes. The scale development candidate genes identified in the current study will facilitate functional gene identifications in the future.	2022-03-12	2024-03-06 20:29:43	2024-03-06T20:29:43Z	2024-03-06 20:29:43	64		2	7		Fishes								en					DOI.org (Crossref)

Transcription factors or chromatin modifiers are involved in orchestrating gene activity, such as the cohesin genes and their regulator NIPBL. In our previous studies, using a zebrafish model for nipblb knockdown, we described the effect of nipblb loss-of-function in specific contexts, such as central nervous system development and hematopoiesis. However, the genome-wide transcriptional impact of nipblb loss-of-function in zebrafish embryos at diverse developmental stages remains under investigation. By RNA-seq analyses in zebrafish embryos at 24 h post-fertilization, we examined genome-wide effects of nipblb knockdown on transcriptional programs. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that nipblb loss-of-function has an impact on gene expression at 24 h post fertilization, mainly resulting in gene inactivation. A similar transcriptional effect has also been reported in other organisms, supporting the use of zebrafish as a model to understand the role of Nipbl in gene regulation during early vertebrate development. Moreover, we unraveled a connection between nipblb-dependent differential expression and gene expression patterns of hematological cell populations and AML subtypes, enforcing our previous evidence on the involvement of NIPBL-related transcriptional dysregulation in hematological malignancies.	2020-12-19	2024-03-06 20:26:40	2024-03-06T20:26:40Z	2024-03-06 20:26:39	9719		24	21		IJMS								en					DOI.org (Crossref)
