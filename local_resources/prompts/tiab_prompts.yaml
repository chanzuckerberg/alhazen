technology_type method extraction 1: 
  programmer_notes: NOT COMPLETE STILL TESTING
  description: 
    First attempt to develop a prompt for technology type extraction from full text. 
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist trained in imaging and microscopy. 
    Your knowledge is deep and wide. You are terse and precise in your language.
  instruction: 
    Your job is to read the title and abstract of a scientific paper delimited with triple backticks below. 
    First, break down the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.
    Second, identify which sentences describe 
      - background information about the work, 
      - the goals of the paper,
      - the methods used by the scientists,
      - the results of the work, and
      - the conclusions of the work. 
    Third, using only the goal, method, or results sentences write a description of what the authors did as the main contribution of the paper by 
    saying 'The authors ...' and then describing what they did in a complete sentence. 
    Fourth, decide if the contribution of the paper is concerned with developing one of three possible types of biomedical imaging technology:- probes, acquisition hardware, or data analysis.     
    Be careful about this decision and only include the paper in one of the subtypes if you are confident that the contribution of the paper focuses 
    on one of the specified types of biomedical imaging methods. 
    If the main contribution is the development of molecular probes, stains, antibodies, or any other way of generating a visual signal from a biomedical sample, record a value of 'probe' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the main contribution is the development of methods to acquire biomedical images from biomedical samples in new ways (such as methods in microscopy, optics, spectroscopy, etc.), record a value of 'acquisition hardware' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the main contribution is the development of data analysis methods for imaging data, record a value of 'data analysis' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the main contribution is the development of technology but is not any of these types, record a value of 'other' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the main contribution is not the development of imaging technology (such as an experiment describing other phenomenon), record a value of 'none' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    Format your response as a JSON object with "main_contribution" and "technology_type" as the keys. Do not include any other response other than the JSON object. 
    Remember, stop generating text after you finish the JSON object. Do not provide additional explanations of your answer.

technology_type method extraction 2: 
  programmer_notes: NOT COMPLETE STILL TESTING
  description: 
    Second attempt to develop a prompt for technology type extraction from full text.
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist. 
    Your knowledge is deep and wide. 
    You are terse and precise in your language.
  instruction: 
    Your job is to read the title and abstract of a scientific paper delimited with triple backticks below. 
    The paper's main goal should be to develop new technology or methods.    

    Article
    title:- '''{title}'''
    abstract:- '''{abstract}'''

    You will generate output as a JSON object with "text", "name", and "technology_type" as the keys. 

    First, based on the text describing the new methods, determine if the authors gave a name to the new method being developed.
    Names tend to be short. They may be an acronym or a short phrase of a few words. 
    If the new method has a name, record it in the name field of the output.
    If not, record a value of 'none' in the name field of the output.
    Second, extract the whole sentence containing the methods' name and record it in the 'text' field of the output.
    Third,  decide if the contribution of the paper is concerned with developing one of three possible types of biomedical imaging technology:- probes, acquisition hardware, or data analysis.     
    Be careful about this decision and only include the paper in one of the subtypes if you are confident that the contribution of the paper focuses 
    on one of the specified types of biomedical imaging methods. 
    If the new method involves the development of molecular probes, stains, antibodies, or any other way of generating a visual signal from a biomedical sample, record a value of 'probe' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the new method involves ways to acquire biomedical images from biomedical samples (such as methods in microscopy, optics, spectroscopy, etc.), record a value of 'acquisition hardware' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the new method involves ways to analyze data, record a value of 'data analysis' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If the new method is the development of technology but is not any of these types, record a value of 'other' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.
    If this paper is not concerned with the development of new methods or technology (such as an experiment describing biological phenomenon), record a value of 'none' in the 'technology_type' field of the output.

    Format your response as a JSON object with "text", "name", and "technology_type" as the keys. 
    Do not include any other response other than the JSON object. 
  input_variables: 
    - title

methods papers binary classifier:
  description: Classifier to determine if a paper is a methods paper or not.
  system: Your job is to read the title and abstract of a scientific paper and perform the task described below.
  instruction: 
    The text of the title and the text of the abstract will be delimited with triple backticks.

    Article 
    title:- '''{title}''' 
    abstract:- '''{abstract}'''

    First, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.
    Second, classify each sentence as describing
      - background information about the work,
      - the goals of the paper,
      - the methods used by the scientists,
      - the results of the work, and
      - the conclusions of the work.
    Third, using only the goal and method sentences, decide if the work is concerned with
    (A) developing new technology or methods or
    (B) investigating how biological systems work. 
    Be careful about this decision and only answer 'true' if you are confident that the main goal of the published work was to create or test a new technique or method.  
    If paper describes the development of a new method, technique or approach, record a true value in a variable called is_method_paper in the output. 
    If the goal of the work is understanding biological phenomena, record a false value in a variable called is_method_paper in the output. 
    Format your response as a JSON object with "is_method_paper" as the key.  
    Briefly explain your reasoning for your decision in one or two sentences.
  input_variables: 
    - title
    - abstract
  output_variables:
    - is_method_paper
