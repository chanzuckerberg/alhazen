    You are an expert biological scientist, skilled at reading scientific papers.
  instruction: >
    Read the text of a research paper shown below 
    (delimited with triple backticks).

    Section Text:- '''{section_text}'''

    The text is taken from a scientific paper that uses {methodology} to {method_goal}.

    In general, the protocol can be represented as a directed bipartite graph, where each node in the graph is either a protocol step or an entity and edges either connect a protocol step to an entity or an entity to a protocol step. 
    
    First, read the text of the methods section and break it into subsections based on the different protocol steps being applied. 
    Second, identify which protocol step corresponds to the steps described in the text and compute what entities act as inputs and outputs to each protocol step. 
    Thirdly, design a directed graph of the described protocol consisting of entities, protocol steps and links between them.
    Finally, write out the directed graph as Mermaid.js code where each protocol step is written as `p_ID([Name])` format and each entity is written with the `e_ID[Name]` format.

    For example, if the text describes an experiment with the following steps:
    * A sample of S. Pombe cells are vitirified to provide frozen sections
    * The thick sections are then milled using a Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) to create a Lamella
    * This Lamella is then mounted on a grid
    * The grid is imaged using CryoET under various tilt angles to generate a tilt series
    * The tilt series dataset is then analyzed with tomography to generate a 3D tomogram. 
    * The tomogram is then manually examined and annotated with organelles and other structures of interest.

    Then the entities involved would be: A[S. Pombe cells], B[Frozen S. Pombe cells], C[Lamella], D[Mounted Sample], E[Tilt Series], F[Tomogram], and G[Annotation Set] 
    Then the protocol steps would be: U([Vitrification]), V([FIB Milling]), X([Mount on grid]), Y([CryoET Imaging]), and Z([Tomogram Generation]), and W([Tomogram Annotation])
    Finally, this would lead to generation of the following Mermaid.js code:
    ```mermaid:
    graph TD
      A[S. Pombe cells] -->  U([Vitrification]),
      U --> B[Frozen S. Pombe cells],
      B --> V([FIB Milling]),
      V --> C[Mounted Sample], 
      C --> X([Mount on grid]),
      X --> D[Mounted Sample],
      D --> Y([CryoET Imaging]),
      Y --> E([Tilt Series]),
      E --> Z([Tomogram Generation]),
      Z --> F[Tomogram],
      F --> W([Tomogram Annotation])
      W --> G([Annotation Set])
    ```
  
    Generate only Mermaid.js code .

  description: 
    Identify what protocol step of an experiment is being described, given an existing model of the protocol steps.
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist, skilled at reading scientific papers.
  instruction: 
    Read the text of a section of a research paper shown below 
    (delimited with triple backticks).

    Section Text:- '''{section_text}'''

    The text is taken from a scientific paper that uses {methodology} to {method_goal}.

    The text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work. 
    
    If the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - 
    {all_protocol_steps} 

    If the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.
    
    Generate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'. 
    Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.
    
    Identify which of these parts of the protocol are described in the text, and record
    the corresponding value of {all_protocol_step_codes} in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.
