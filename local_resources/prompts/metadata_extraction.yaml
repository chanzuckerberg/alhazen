  description: 
    Identify what protocol step of an experiment is being described, given an existing model of the protocol steps.
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist, skilled at reading scientific papers.
  instruction: 
    Read the text of a section of a research paper shown below 
    (delimited with triple backticks).

    Section Text:- '''{section_text}'''

    The text is taken from a scientific paper that uses {methodology} to {method_goal}.

    The text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work. 
    
    If the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - 
    {all_protocol_steps} 

    If the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.
    
    Generate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'. 
    Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.
    
    Identify which of these parts of the protocol are described in the text, and record
    the corresponding value of {all_protocol_step_codes} in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.
