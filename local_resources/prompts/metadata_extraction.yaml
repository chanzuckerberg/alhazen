protocol step identification: 
  programmer_notes: NOT COMPLETE STILL TESTING
  description: 
    Identify what protocol step of an experiment is being described, given an existing model of the protocol steps.
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist, skilled at reading scientific papers.
  instruction: 
    Read the text of a section of a research paper shown below 
    (delimited with triple backticks).

    Section Text:- '''{section_text}'''

    The text is taken from a scientific paper that uses {methodology} to {method_goal}.

    The text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work. 
    
    If the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - 
    {all_protocol_steps} 

    If the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.
    
    Generate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'. 
    Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.
    
    Identify which of these parts of the protocol are described in the text, and record
    the corresponding value of {all_protocol_step_codes} in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.

    - section_text

metadata extraction: 
  programmer_notes: NOT COMPLETE STILL TESTING
  description: 
    First attempt to develop a prompt for metadata extraction from full text.
  system: 
    You are an expert biological scientist, skilled at reading scientific papers.
  instruction: 
    Read the text of a section from the methods section of a research paper shown below 
    (delimited with triple backticks).

    Section Text:- '''{section_text}'''

    The text is taken from a scientific paper that uses {methodology} to {method_goal}.

    Extract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets 
    and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not extract any other metadata. 

    [{metadata_specification}]

    Record the term '{metadata_name}' in the 'metadata_name' field of the output.
    
    Generate only JSON formatted output with three fields 'metadata_name', 'metadata_value' and 'orginal_text'. 
    Do not provide additional explanation or context for the answer.
   
    If the metadata is not present in the text, record a value of 'not present' in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.  
    Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.
    
    Finally, if you found the metadata in the text, record the original text of the sentence 
    where the metadata specification was extracted from in the 'original_text' field of the output. 
    
    If you did not find the specified metadata in the text, record 'not present' in the 'original_text' field of the output.

    Remember, only generate JSON formatted output without any additional text or explanation.
