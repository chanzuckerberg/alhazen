  instruction: >
    Read through the following JSON encoding of {k} research articles: 

    Each document has three attributes: (A) a digital object identifier ('DOI') code, (B) a CITATION string containing the authors, publication year, title and publication location, and the (C) CONTENT field with the title and abstract of the paper.  

    ```CONTEXT:{context}```

    If CONTEXT is provided, generate a JSON list of summaries of each article in order to help answer the following question:

    Question: {question}

    Do NOT directly answer the question, instead summarize to give evidence to help answer the question.

    Restrict each summary to {summary_length} words. 
    Also, provide a score from 1-10 indicating relevance to question. Do not explain your score. 

    Write this answer as JSON formatted output. Provide a list of {k} dict objects with the following fields: DOI, SUMMARY, RELEVANCE SCORE. 

    Do not provide additional explanation for the answer.
    Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.
