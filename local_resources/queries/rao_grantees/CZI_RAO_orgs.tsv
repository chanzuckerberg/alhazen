11	Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation	Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a rare, aggressive liver cancer, occurs predominantly in otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults (AYA) 12 to 34 years of age. Patients generally are unaware of the tumor until it has grown large, causing pain and other symptoms. Diagnosis includes imaging and biopsy; FLC has a characteristic histology with fibrotic bands. Many physicians are unfamiliar with FLC (estimated <500 new USA cases annually). Thus, to patients the cancer appears both mysterious and threatening. Surgery remains the only effective treatment for FLC, but only two-thirds of new patients have operable primary tumors and most have widespread metastatic disease. Repeated aggressive surgery, including removal of local lymph nodes and distant metastases, is often used as a last resort despite extensive scarring and discomfort. Sadly, the majority of patients relapse within a year. Local radiation and available systemic therapies appear largely ineffective. There is no oncological standard of care. In consequence FLC has an exceptionally low five-year survival rate. On average the disease robs its victims of more than 50 years of expected life. The impact on quality of life is devastating. Without prior warning, young people – focused on school, first jobs, new marriages, children – face a maelstrom of uncertainty and, too often, a bitterly unfavorable prognosis. AYA patients and their families are especially vulnerable to the attendant mental, physical, and spiritual challenges. A Compassionate Allowance designation for FLC secured by our Foundation from the Social Security Administration allays some financial burdens, but not the enormous human cost.	Cycle 1 Grantee	2009

36	Cure VCP Disease, Inc.	VCP disease is an adult-onset, autosomal dominant, genetic disease caused by a mutation in the VCP gene. The original clinical name of VCP disease is IBMPFD, which identifies the three primary phenotypes originally associated with VCP:  Inclusion Body Myopathy (IBM), Paget's disease of bone (P), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In 2019, clinicians and researchers began categorizing this disease as multisystem proteinopathy (MSP-1) because it is a protein disorder that affects multiple body systems. Other phenotypes associated with the presence of a VCP variant are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Parkinsonism, cataracts, and cardiomyopathy.  VCP disease is multisystem and not mutually exclusive to one system; therefore, a VCP patient may have one, two, or any combination of these disparate conditions.   (For the purpose of this application, “VCP disease” will be used to refer to the rare disease represented by Cure VCP Disease, Inc. )	Cycle 2 Grantee	2018
