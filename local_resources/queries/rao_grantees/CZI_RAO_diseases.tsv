64	36	VCP Myopathy	MONDO:0018006	x	VCP disease is an adult-onset, autosomal dominant, genetic disease caused by a mutation in the VCP gene. The original clinical name of VCP disease is IBMPFD, which identifies the three primary phenotypes originally associated with VCP:  Inclusion Body Myopathy (IBM), Paget's disease of bone (P), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In 2019, clinicians and researchers began categorizing this disease as multisystem proteinopathy (MSP-1) because it is a protein disorder that affects multiple body systems. Other phenotypes associated with the presence of a VCP variant are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Parkinsonism, cataracts, and cardiomyopathy.  VCP disease is multisystem and not mutually exclusive to one system; therefore, a VCP patient may have one, two, or any combination of these disparate conditions.
