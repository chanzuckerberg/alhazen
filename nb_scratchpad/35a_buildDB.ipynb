Cryo-ET acquisition parameters are summarized in Supplementary Tables 7-9. Tomograms were acquired on a K2 Summit direct detection camera (Gatan) operating in dose fractionation mode utilizing a Quantum post-column energy filter operated at zero-loss (Gatan). A calibrated pixel size of 3.45 A was used for the NPC defocus* data and 3.37 A for the remaining datasets. Up to 14 tilt series were collected on a single lamella in low dose mode using SerialEM54. Starting from the lamella pre-tilt, images were acquired in 2degrees increments within a range of +58degrees to -40degrees using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme55 with a constant electron dose per tilt image. For ground truth data, a set of ten tilt series were either collected with a 70 mum objective aperture or a VPP56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with prior conditioning for 5 min. NPC data was collected as described in previous work26,57, but at 1.5-4.5 mum defocus, with 3degrees increments and an effective tilt range of +50degrees to -50degrees.\",\n",

Tomograms were acquired on a K2 Summit direct detection camera (Gatan) operating in dose fractionation mode utilizing a Quantum post-column energy filter operated at zero-loss (Gatan). A calibrated pixel size of 3.45 A was used for the NPC defocus* data and 3.37 A for the remaining datasets. Up to 14 tilt series were collected on a single lamella in low dose mode using SerialEM54. Starting from the lamella pre-tilt, images were acquired in 2degrees increments within a range of +58degrees to -40degrees using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme55 with a constant electron dose per tilt image. For ground truth data, a set of ten tilt series were either collected with a 70 mum objective aperture or a VPP56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with prior conditioning for 5 min. NPC data was collected as described in previous work26,57, but at 1.5-4.5 mum defocus, with 3degrees increments and an effective tilt range of +50degrees to -50degrees.\",\n",

Cryo-ET acquisition parameters are summarized in Supplementary Tables 7-9. Tomograms were acquired on a K2 Summit direct detection camera (Gatan) operating in dose fractionation mode utilizing a Quantum post-column energy filter operated at zero-loss (Gatan). A calibrated pixel size of 3.45 A was used for the NPC defocus* data and 3.37 A for the remaining datasets. Up to 14 tilt series were collected on a single lamella in low dose mode using SerialEM54. Starting from the lamella pre-tilt, images were acquired in 2degrees increments within a range of +58degrees to -40degrees using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme55 with a constant electron dose per tilt image. For ground truth data, a set of ten tilt series were either collected with a 70 mum objective aperture or a VPP56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with prior conditioning for 5 min. NPC data was collected as described in previous work26,57, but at 1.5-4.5 mum defocus, with 3degrees increments and an effective tilt range of +50degrees to -50degrees.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

CNN predictions were masked with a segmentation of the cytosol. For ribosomes, step 2 was repeated three times (always trained on combined predictions of step 1 and the preceding round) and each round consisted of three simultaneously trained networks with default hyperparameters (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), except for the number of IF = 4, 8, and 32, to provide a cumulative prediction that is less overfitted to the incomplete training data. Cumulative predictions were manually revised in tom_chooser (ribosomes) and in EMAN2 (FAS) and manual picking was performed in either spectrum-matched or Gaussian-filtered tomograms (sigma = 3) for up to three rounds in EMAN2 spt2_boxer59 (step 3; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The particle lists were cleaned for duplicates by applying elliptic distance constraints to the coordinates (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).\\nTemplate matching for ribosomes was performed with pyTOM60 by a 3D cross-correlation search over 1,944 Euler angle combinations using the large subunit of S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome map (EMDB accession EMD-3228 (ref. 61)) scaled to the corresponding pixel size, and a spherical mask (diameter 337 A). The 2,000-3,000 highest cross correlation scores were manually revised in Gaussian-filtered tomograms (sigma = 3) with tom_chooser (pyTOM toolbox60). For FAS in the VPP dataset template matching with a published S. cerevisiae FAS33 map (EMDB accession EMD-1623) as reference failed.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles. (E) reconstructing 3-D tomograms in by aligning tilt series and performing reconstruction computations. (F) annotating the 3D model of the sample to identify structures of interest. (G) other protocol steps, not listed above.\\nIf the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'.

For FAS in the VPP dataset template matching with a published S. cerevisiae FAS33 map (EMDB accession EMD-1623) as reference failed.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

For the NPCs, a subunit mask obtained by prior 3D averaging in novaSTA (10.5281/zenodo.3973623) was pasted at each of the eight subunit locations. The ribosome, FAS, membrane, organelle and cytosol masks in defocus and VPP along with the list of coordinates and respective tomograms are used in the subsequent training and performance analysis, and are available from the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR; Data Availability).'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles. (E) reconstructing 3-D tomograms in by aligning tilt series and performing reconstruction computations. (F) annotating the 3D model of the sample to identify structures of interest.

The ribosome, FAS, membrane, organelle and cytosol masks in defocus and VPP along with the list of coordinates and respective tomograms are used in the subsequent training and performance analysis, and are available from the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR; Data Availability).'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not extract any other metadata.\\n[What computational methods / algorithms were used (e.g., weighted back propagation, etc)?]\\nRecord the term 'reconstruction_method' in the 'metadata_name' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with three fields 'metadata_name', 'metadata_value' and 'orginal_text'. Do not provide additional explanation or context for the answer.\\nIf the metadata is not present in the text, record a value of 'not present' in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

This model was applied to the HeLa cell tomogram (EMDB accession EMD-11992) and the resulting predictions used to extract coordinates in the following steps: using skeleton3d67 and a custom script in Matlab (version 2019a; Code Availability), particles were sampled along each filament at 6 pixel steps in a 4x-binned tomogram (corresponding to 101 A with an unbinned pixel size of 4.21 A), with each particle rotated by 360degrees/13 along the third Euler angle (second in-plane rotation). Particle cropping, alignment, and averaging were performed in Dynamo24 (v.1.1.520). Particles were cropped from a 2x-binned tomogram with a pixel size of 8.42 A per pixel, aligned over three rounds with a hollow tube as starting reference. Helical symmetry was applied starting from the second round of alignments.

Resolution was determined at 39 A (0.5 cut-off) by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) using the odd and even particles of the masked, final average.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

Visualization and calculation of cross-correlations (CC) between different maps and models, was performed with the UCSF ChimeraX package68.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

CTFs were first estimated in the sums of raw tilt movies and subsequently in the tilt series taking the tilt angles into account. Subtomograms containing ribosomes and their CTF models were reconstructed in volumes of 140(3) pixels with a pixel size of 3.3702 A and a particle diameter of 350 A. Initial alignments were performed in RELION version 3.0.723 in 25 iterations of 3D classification, with the S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome (EMDB accession EMD-3228, low-pass filtered to 60 A) as reference to generate an initial single-class average. 3D refinements were performed with the resulting average as a reference. In defocus data, this average was further refined in M22 to optimize particle poses, image and volume warping to model non-linear deformations. Particles were re-extracted and hierarchical 3D classifications (25 iterations each) were performed in RELION. For VPP data, 3D classifications were performed directly after 3D refinements in RELION. Focused classifications were performed with binary masks indicated in the respective figures.\\\"\\n}\",\n",

      "  \"section_text\": \"CNN pre- and post-processing\\nTomograms were first normalized to obtain uniform mean of 0 and variance of 1 in the frequency domain, before training. The spectrum equalization filter was then applied by matching the amplitude spectrum of each tomogram to the target spectrum of one manually selected high-contrast VPP tomogram (Tomogram TS_001; Extended Data Fig. 1b). Extraction of spectra amplitudes was done using fast Fourier transform followed by radial averaging of the amplitudes across the frequency domain. If the Nyquist frequency of the target tomogram is lower than that of the input tomogram, the target spectrum was padded with zeros to match the size of the input spectrum. Next, an equalization vector was created by dividing entry-wise the target spectrum by the respective input spectrum, converted into a rotational kernel and multiplied by the input tomograms in the frequency domain in combination with a sigmoidal-shaped low-pass filter to eliminate high-frequency noise. After back transformation, the tomogram exhibits a similar contrast to the target tomogram (Extended Data Fig. 1).

The spectrum equalization filter was then applied by matching the amplitude spectrum of each tomogram to the target spectrum of one manually selected high-contrast VPP tomogram (Tomogram TS_001; Extended Data Fig. 1b). Extraction of spectra amplitudes was done using fast Fourier transform followed by radial averaging of the amplitudes across the frequency domain. If the Nyquist frequency of the target tomogram is lower than that of the input tomogram, the target spectrum was padded with zeros to match the size of the input spectrum. Next, an equalization vector was created by dividing entry-wise the target spectrum by the respective input spectrum, converted into a rotational kernel and multiplied by the input tomograms in the frequency domain in combination with a sigmoidal-shaped low-pass filter to eliminate high-frequency noise. After back transformation, the tomogram exhibits a similar contrast to the target tomogram (Extended Data Fig. 1). For the 2D CNN, tomograms and training segmentations are processed slice-wise into 2D tiles with a fixed size of 288 x 288 pixels (256 x 256 pixels and 16 pixels padding on each side).

In the test for domain generalization, the same three networks (trained on the eight VPP tomograms) were applied to the ten defocus tomograms.\\nThe NPC predictions, treated as segmentation tasks, were evaluated in the defocus* independent data selected for that purpose using a threefold cross-validation where the total 127 tomograms were split into three random subsets with roughly the same number of tomograms each. Each fold consists of two such sets as training data and the remaining one for testing (Supplementary Note 1 and Extended Data Fig. 6d-f). The nuclear envelope predictions, which were used as 'region mask' in the 'contact' mode during post-processing of the NPC prediction, were achieved with a 3D CNN trained on 18 manually annotated tomograms, and which were uniformly distributed across the three dataset splits.\\nFor organelle and cytosol segmentation evaluation, model performance was evaluated on the voxel-level for the post-processed 2D CNN predictions produced by the individually trained model of each cross-validation fold, using 5,000 voxels picked randomly from each tomogram of the respective test set of cross-validation fold. Precision and recall (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4) were computed at threshold values varying from 0 to 1 on the picked voxels to compute the area under the precision-recall curves (AURPC) for each tomogram.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles. (E) reconstructing 3-D tomograms in by aligning tilt series and performing reconstruction computations. (F) annotating the 3D model of the sample to identify structures of interest. (G) other protocol steps, not listed above.\\nIf the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'. Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.\\nIdentify which of these parts of the protocol are described in the text, and record the corresponding value of A, B, C, D, E, F, or G in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.\\n                [/INST]</s>\"\n",

Precision and recall (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4) were computed at threshold values varying from 0 to 1 on the picked voxels to compute the area under the precision-recall curves (AURPC) for each tomogram.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

      "Cryo-electron tomograms capture a wealth of structural information on the molecular constituents of cells and tissues. We present DeePiCt (deep picker in context), an open-source deep-learning framework for supervised segmentation and macromolecular complex localization in cryo-electron tomography. To train and benchmark DeePiCt on experimental data, we comprehensively annotated 20 tomograms of Schizosaccharomyces pombe for ribosomes, fatty acid synthases, membranes, nuclear pore complexes, organelles, and cytosol. By comparing DeePiCt to state-of-the-art approaches on this dataset, we show its unique ability to identify low-abundance and low-density complexes. We use DeePiCt to study compositionally distinct subpopulations of cellular ribosomes, with emphasis on their contextual association with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, applying pre-trained networks to a HeLa cell tomogram demonstrates that DeePiCt achieves high-quality predictions in unseen datasets from different biological species in a matter of minutes. The comprehensively annotated experimental data and pre-trained networks are provided for immediate use by the community.,format=None,name=None,id=86f140465a,type=CitationRecord,)]\n"
