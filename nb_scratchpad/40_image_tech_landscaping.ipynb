The red fluorescent dye sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) was specifically taken up by protoplasmic astrocytes after brief exposure to the brain surface. Specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, SR101 labeled enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing astrocytes but not microglial cells in transgenic mice. We used SR101 labeling to quantify morphological characteristics of astrocytes and to visualize their close association with the cortical microvasculature. Furthermore, by combining this method with calcium indicator loading of cell populations, we demonstrated distinct calcium dynamics in astroglial and neuronal networks.

The goals of the paper are to describe a new microfluidic culture platform for studying axonal biology and to use this platform to investigate the localization of mRNA in developing rat cortical and hippocampal axons. The methods used by the scientists include the development and use of the microfluidic culture platform, live cell imaging, and biochemical analyses. The results of the work include the first evidence that presynaptic but not postsynaptic mRNA is localized to developing rat cortical and hippocampal axons, and the demonstration of the platform's ability to model CNS axonal injury and regeneration. Overall, the work is primarily concerned with understanding biological phenomena, rather than developing new technology or methods, therefore the value of \\\"is_method_paper\\\" is false.\"\n",

These devices provide a powerful means to eliminate from images the background caused by out-of-focus light and scatter. Confocal techniques can also improve the resolution of a light microscope image beyond what is achievable with widefield fluorescence microscopy. The quality of the images obtained, however, depends on the user's familiarity with the optical and fluorescence concepts that underlie this approach. We describe the core concepts of confocal microscopes and important variables that adversely affect confocal images. We also discuss data-processing methods for confocal microscopy and computational optical sectioning techniques that can perform optical sectioning without a confocal microscope.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

There, T3S effectors exert many effects, such as cellular invasion or modulation of host immune responses. Studying spatiotemporal orchestrated secretion of various effectors has been difficult without disrupting their functions. Here we developed a new approach using Shigella flexneri T3S as a model to investigate bacterial translocation of individual effectors via multidimensional time-lapse microscopy. We demonstrate that direct fluorescent labeling of tetracysteine motif-tagged effectors IpaB and IpaC is possible in situ without loss of function. Studying the T3S kinetics of IpaB and IpaC ejection from individual bacteria, we found that the entire pools of IpaB and IpaC were released concurrently upon host cell contact, and that 50% of each effector was secreted in 240 s.

Here we show that lipid bodies are a major source of contrast in third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy of cells and tissues. In hepatocytes, micrometer-sized lipid bodies produce a THG signal 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than other structures, which allows one to image them with high specificity. THG microscopy with approximately 1,200 nm excitation can be used to follow the distribution of lipid bodies in a variety of unstained samples including insect embryos, plant seeds and intact mammalian tissue (liver, lung). We found that epi-THG imaging is possible in weakly absorbing tissues because bulk scattering redirects a substantial fraction of the forward-generated harmonic light toward the objective. Finally, we show that the combination of THG microscopy with two-photon and second-harmonic imaging provides a new tool for exploring the interactions between lipid bodies, extracellular matrix and fluorescent compounds (vitamin A, NADH and others) in tissues.\",\n",

We also revealed functional LGN-V1 connectivity by stimulating LGN electrically and detecting responses in layer 4 of V1 using calcium imaging, field potential recordings and whole-cell recordings. We also identified layer-4 neurons that receive direct thalamocortical input. Finally, we compared cortical activity after LGN stimulation with spontaneous cortical activity and found significant overlap of the spatiotemporal dynamics generated by both types of events.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

This strategy, pooling with imaginary tags followed by deconvolution (PI-deconvolution), allows the screening of 2(n) probe proteins (baits) in 2 x n pools, with n replicates for each bait. Deconvolution of baits with their binding partners (preys) can be achieved by reading the prey's profile from the 2 x n experiments. We validated this strategy for protein-protein interaction mapping using both proteome microarrays and a yeast two-hybrid array, demonstrating that PI-deconvolution can be used to identify interactions accurately with fewer experiments and better coverage. We also show that PI-deconvolution can be used to identify protein-small molecule interactions inferred from profiling the yeast deletion collection. PI-deconvolution should be applicable to a wide range of library-against-library approaches and can also be used to optimize array designs.\",\n",

Integrase-mediated recombination resulted in proper targeting of parasite proteins to intra-erythrocytic compartments, including the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle. Recombinant attB x attP parasites were genetically stable in the absence of drug and were phenotypically homogeneous.

Using time-lapse video microscopy, coculture experiments with genetically labeled cells, and analysis of the volume of spheres, we observed that neurospheres are highly motile structures prone to fuse even under ostensibly 'clonal' culture conditions. Chimeric neurospheres were prevalent independent of ages, species and neural structures. Thus, the intrinsic dynamic of neurospheres, as conventionally assayed, introduces confounders. More accurate conditions (for example, plating a single cell per miniwell) will be crucial for assessing clonality, number and fate of stem cells.

Here we present a strategy for assigning backbone and side-chain resonances of large proteins without deuteration, with which one can obtain high-resolution structures from (1)H-(1)H distance restraints. The strategy uses information from through-bond correlation experiments to filter intraresidue and sequential correlations from through-space correlation experiments, and then matches the filtered correlations to obtain sequential assignment. We demonstrate this strategy on three proteins ranging from 24 to 65 kDa for resonance assignment and on maltose binding protein (42 kDa) and hemoglobin (65 kDa) for high-resolution structure determination. The strategy extends the size limit for structure determination by NMR spectroscopy to 42 kDa for monomeric proteins and to 65 kDa for differentially labeled multimeric proteins without the need for deuteration or selective labeling.\",\n",

We present a magnetic resonance imaging method for precise in vivo localization of cortical recording sites. In this method, the susceptibility-induced effect thickens the appearance of the microelectrode and enhances the detectability of the microelectrode tip, which usually occupies less than a few percent of the volume of an image voxel. In a phantom study, the optimized susceptibility-induced effect allowed tip detection with single-voxel accuracy (in-plane resolution, 50 mum). We applied this method to recording microelectrodes inserted into the brains of macaque monkeys, and localized the microelectrode tip at an in-plane resolution of 150 mum within the cortex of 2-3 mm in thickness. Subsequent histological analyses validated the single-voxel accuracy of the in vivo tip localization. This method opens up a way to investigate information flow during cognitive processes in the brain.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

Irradiation liberates the trapped molecule, permitting targeted perturbation of a biological process. Uncaging technology and fluorescence microscopy are 'optically orthogonal': the former allows control, and the latter, observation of cellular function. Used in conjunction with other technologies (for example, patch clamp and/or genetics), the light beam becomes a uniquely powerful tool to stimulate a selected biological target in space or time. Here I describe important examples of widely used caged compounds, their design features and synthesis, as well as practical details of how to use them with living cells.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

A patch electrode is used to perfuse the extracellular space surrounding the neuron of interest with a fluorescent dye, thus enabling the neuron to be visualized as a negative image ('shadow') and identified on the basis of its somatodendritic structure. The same electrode is then placed on the neuron under visual control to allow formation of a gigaseal ('shadowpatching'). We demonstrate the reliability and versatility of shadowpatching by performing whole-cell recordings from visually identified neurons in the neocortex and cerebellum of rat and mouse. We also show that the method can be used for targeted in vivo single-cell electroporation of plasmid DNA into identified cell types, leading to stable transgene expression. This approach facilitates the recording, labeling and genetic manipulation of single neurons in the intact native mammalian brain without the need to pre-label neuronal populations.\",\n",

Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) offers investigators the means with which to unambiguously study peptides and proteins with molecular specificity, and to determine their distribution in two and three dimensions. In the past few years, several parameters have been optimized for IMS, including sample preparation, matrix application and instrumental acquisition parameters (Box 1). These developments have resulted in a high degree of reproducibility in mass accuracy and peak intensities (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Recently, we have optimized our protocol to be able to increase the number of molecular species analyzed by collecting two sets of sections, covering one set of sections with sinapinic acid for optimal detection of proteins and adjacent sections with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix for the optimal detection of low-mass species, including peptides. Approximately 1,000 peaks can be observed in each dataset (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the sections are collected at an equal distance, 200 mum instead of 400-500 mum used previously, thus enabling the use of virtual z-stacks and three-dimensional (3D) volume renderings to investigate differential localization patterns in much smaller brain structures such as the substantia nigra and the interpeduncular nucleus. Here we present our optimized step-by-step procedure based on previous work in our laboratory, describing how to make 3D volume reconstructions of MALDI IMS data, as applied to the rat brain.\",\n",

Furthermore, the sections are collected at an equal distance, 200 mum instead of 400-500 mum used previously, thus enabling the use of virtual z-stacks and three-dimensional (3D) volume renderings to investigate differential localization patterns in much smaller brain structures such as the substantia nigra and the interpeduncular nucleus. Here we present our optimized step-by-step procedure based on previous work in our laboratory, describing how to make 3D volume reconstructions of MALDI IMS data, as applied to the rat brain.\",\n",

We created spatially resolved maps of single-molecule motions by imaging the membrane proteins Gag and VSVG, and obtained several orders of magnitude more trajectories per cell than traditional single-particle tracking enables. By probing distinct subsets of molecules, sptPALM can provide insight into the origins of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in membranes.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

Ionizing radiation is the agent of choice to produce DSBs in cells; however, targeting DSBs and monitoring changes in their position over time can be difficult. Here we describe a procedure for induction of easily recognizable linear arrays of DSBs in nuclei of adherent eukaryotic cells by exposing the cells to alpha particles from a small Americium source (Box 1). Each alpha particle traversing the cell nucleus induces a linear array of DSBs, typically 10-20 DSBs per 10 mum track length. Because alpha particles cannot penetrate cell-culture plastic or coverslips, it is necessary to irradiate cells through a Mylar membrane. We describe setup and irradiation procedures for two types of experiments: immunodetection of DSB response proteins in fixed cells grown in Mylar-bottom culture dishes (Option A) and detection of fluorescently labeled DSB-response proteins in living cells irradiated through a Mylar membrane placed on top of the cells (Option B). Using immunodetection, recruitment of repair proteins to individual DSB sites as early as 30 s after irradiation can be detected. Furthermore, combined with fluorescence live-cell microscopy of fluorescently tagged DSB-response proteins, this technique allows spatiotemporal analysis of the DSB repair response in living cells. Although the procedures might seem a bit intimidating, in our experience, once the source and the setup are ready, it is easy to obtain results.

Conventional redox-sensitive GFPs (roGFPs) are limited by undefined specificity and slow response to changes in redox potential. In this study we demonstrate that the fusion of human glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1) to roGFP2 facilitates specific real-time equilibration between the sensor protein and the glutathione redox couple. The Grx1-roGFP2 fusion protein allowed dynamic live imaging of the glutathione redox potential (E(GSH)) in different cellular compartments with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. The biosensor detected nanomolar changes in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) against a backdrop of millimolar reduced glutathione (GSH) on a scale of seconds to minutes. It facilitated the observation of redox changes associated with growth factor availability, cell density, mitochondrial depolarization, respiratory burst activity and immune receptor stimulation.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

We photo-triggered release of acetylcholine or gamma-aminobutyric acid at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions using targeted expression of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Channelrhodopsin-2. In intact Channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic worms, photostimulation instantly induced body elongation (for gamma-aminobutyric acid) or contraction (for acetylcholine), which we analyzed acutely, or during sustained activation with automated image analysis, to assess synaptic efficacy. In dissected worms, photostimulation evoked neurotransmitter-specific postsynaptic currents that could be triggered repeatedly and at various frequencies. Light-evoked behaviors and postsynaptic currents were significantly (P <or= 0.05) altered in mutants with pre- or postsynaptic defects, although the behavioral phenotypes did not unambiguously report on synaptic function in all cases tested. OptIoN facilitates the analysis of neurotransmission with high temporal precision, in a neurotransmitter-selective manner, possibly allowing future investigation of synaptic plasticity in C. elegans.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.

Cells are plated on micropatterned surfaces functionalized with antibodies to the bait extracellular domain. Bait-prey interactions are assayed through the redistribution of the fluorescent prey. We used the method to characterize the interaction between human CD4, the major co-receptor in T-cell activation, and human Lck, the protein tyrosine kinase essential for early T-cell signaling. We measured equilibrium associations by quantifying Lck redistribution to CD4 micropatterns and studied interaction dynamics by photobleaching experiments and single-molecule imaging. In addition to the known zinc clasp structure, the Lck membrane anchor in particular had a major impact on the Lck-CD4 interaction, mediating direct binding and further stabilizing the interaction of other Lck domains. In total, membrane anchorage increased the interaction lifetime by two orders of magnitude.\",\n",

We measured equilibrium associations by quantifying Lck redistribution to CD4 micropatterns and studied interaction dynamics by photobleaching experiments and single-molecule imaging.

Here we demonstrated multicolor three-dimensional (3D) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) as a tool to quantitatively probe cellular structures and their interactions. To facilitate STORM imaging, we generated photoswitchable probes in several distinct colors by covalently linking a photoswitchable cyanine reporter and an activator molecule to assist bioconjugation. We performed 3D localization in conjunction with focal plane scanning and correction for refractive index mismatch to obtain whole-cell images with a spatial resolution of 20-30 nm and 60-70 nm in the lateral and axial dimensions, respectively. Using this approach, we imaged the entire mitochondrial network in fixed monkey kidney BS-C-1 cells, and studied the spatial relationship between mitochondria and microtubules. The 3D STORM images resolved mitochondrial morphologies as well as mitochondria-microtubule contacts that were obscured in conventional fluorescence images.'''\\nFirst, split the text of the title and abstract into separate sentences.
