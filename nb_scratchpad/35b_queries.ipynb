      "Visualizing translation dynamics at atomic detail inside a bacterial cell.\n",
      "Translation is the fundamental process of protein synthesis and is catalysed by the ribosome in all living cells<sup>1</sup>. Here we use advances in cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram analysis<sup>2,3</sup> to visualize the structural dynamics of translation inside the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. To interpret the functional states in detail, we first obtain a high-resolution in-cell average map of all translating ribosomes and build an atomic model for the M. pneumoniae ribosome that reveals distinct extensions of ribosomal proteins. Classification then resolves 13 ribosome states that differ in their conformation and composition. These recapitulate major states that were previously resolved in vitro, and reflect intermediates during active translation. On the basis of these states, we animate translation elongation inside native cells and show how antibiotics reshape the cellular translation landscapes. During translation elongation, ribosomes often assemble in defined three-dimensional arrangements to form polysomes<sup>4</sup>. By mapping the intracellular organization of translating ribosomes, we show that their association into polysomes involves a local coordination mechanism that is mediated by the ribosomal protein L9. We propose that an extended conformation of L9 within polysomes mitigates collisions to facilitate translation fidelity. Our work thus demonstrates the feasibility of visualizing molecular processes at atomic detail inside cells.\n",

Tilt-series collection with the dose-symmetric scheme55 was performed on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with a K3 camera (Gatan) using SerialEM 3.8 (ref. 56) with the following parameters: magnification 81,000x, pixel size 1.053 A, tilt range -60degrees to 60degrees with 3degrees increment, total dose 120-140 e- A-2.\\nIn total, 356 native untreated, 65 Cm-treated, 86 PUM-treated and 70 Spc-treated cellular tomograms were analysed in this work. Details of cryo-EM data collection, refinement and validation statistics are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 3-6.'''\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

      "Atomic models for the 30S and 50S subunits were built de novo using maps from focused refinement of Cm-treated ribosomes reported in our previous work3, which were deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under the accession codes EMD-11998 and EMD-11999. Homology models for M. pneumoniae ribosomal proteins were generated using the SWISS-MODEL60 online server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/; accessed April 2020), with a Bacillus subtilis ribosome (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 3J9W) as the template, except for the ribosomal proteins L9 (PDB 1DIV and 4V63), L10 (PDB 1ZAV) and S21 (PDB 5MMJ). rRNA sequences (REFSEQ NC_000912) were aligned to the E. coli rRNA (PDB 4YBB) using the SINA online server61. ModeRNA62 was used to build homology models for rRNAs on the basis of the alignment, with PDB 4YBB as the template. Homology models were rigid-body-fitted into the cryo-ET densities using Chimera63, followed by iterative refinement using PHENIX real-space refinement64 and manual adjustment in Coot65. The ribosomal proteins L9, L10 and L11 were only fitted as rigid bodies into the map owing to the less-resolved local density. The flat conformation of L9 that resides on the ribosome surface was found to be predominant according to the focused classification (see Extended Data Fig. 12n) and was thus built in the model. Sequence extensions for ribosomal proteins S6, L22 and L29 were built de novo. Models were validated using MolProbity66. FSC curves between the model and the map were also calculated for validation67.\n",

The ribosomal proteins L9, L10 and L11 were only fitted as rigid bodies into the map owing to the less-resolved local density. The flat conformation of L9 that resides on the ribosome surface was found to be predominant according to the focused classification (see Extended Data Fig. 12n) and was thus built in the model.

      "Bioinformatic sequence analysis of ribosomal proteins in M. pneumoniae and the comparison with E. coli homologues were performed as follows, with the different steps described in detail below: (i) protein sequences and RefSeq genome annotation for the M. pneumoniae strain M129 (ATCC 29342) were downloaded from NCBI; (ii) protein sequences were also annotated with eggNOG-mapper to obtain COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) IDs8,68; (iii) for the annotated ribosomal proteins, the corresponding COG multiple sequence alignments from representative bacterial species were downloaded from the eggNOG database69; (iv) as M. pneumoniae M129 is not among the representative species, its protein sequences were added to the multiple sequence alignments with MAFFT software70; (v) for each COG multiple sequence alignment, the number of amino acids in every representative species (including M. pneumoniae M129) present at positions before the N terminus and after the C terminus positions of E. coli K-12 substr. MG1655 were calculated; (vi) the presence of N- or C-terminus extensions longer than 20 amino acids was illustrated in iTOL using NCBI taxonomy tree as the basis71; (vii) for all COGs corresponding to proteins with N- or C-terminus extensions in M. pneumoniae that are longer than 20 amino acids, protein disorder and secondary structure were analysed for all representative strains. The presence of cross-links or transposon insertions was also analysed.\n",
      "RefSeq genome annotation and protein sequences for the M. pneumoniae strain M129 (ATCC 29342) were downloaded from NCBI for the M. pneumoniae M129 GCF_000027345.1 assembly from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/027/345/GCF_000027345.1_ASM2734v1/ (accessed 21 April 2021). The file GCF_000027345.1_ASM2734v1_genomic.gff was used to identify ribosomal proteins annotated by RefSeq. The file GCF_000027345.1_ASM2734v1_protein.faa with protein sequences in FASTA format was used as input to the online tool eggNOG-mapper v2, which uses precomputed eggNOG v5.0 clusters and phylogenies for fast orthology assignment69,72. The annotation tables by RefSeq and eggNOG-mapper were merged by protein ID. In total, 52 ribosomal proteins were annotated and mapped to 51 unique COGs68. Two proteins, WP_010874426.1 and WP_010874827.1, were mapped to the same COG0267 corresponding to the ribosomal protein L33. Multiple sequence alignments for the annotated proteins from representative bacterial species were downloaded from the eggNOG v5.0 database69. For each of the 51 COG IDs mapping to ribosomal proteins in M. pneumoniae, the trimmed alignments were downloaded from http://eggnogapi5.embl.de/nog_data/text/trimmed_alg/COG_ID ('COG_ID' in the url should be changed to the corresponding COG ID). As M. pneumoniae M129 is not among the imported representative species, its sequences were added to the multiple sequence alignments. The sequence of each of the proteins was saved in a separate fasta file, and the MAFFT software v.7.475 was used in the add mode for each alignment as follows: mafft --reorder --add protein.fasta --auto trimmed_alg_COG.fa > output_file (ref. 70). For COG0627, the protein WP_010874827.1 from M. pneumoniae was used.\n",
      "For each of the ribosomal COGs, the amino acid positions of the protein from the E. coli strain K-12 substr. MG1655 was taken as a reference, and for each protein from representative species (including M. pneumoniae M129), the number of amino acids before the N-terminus and after the C-terminus locations in E. coli was calculated. In total, 11 ribosomal proteins that had N- or C-terminus extensions of more than 20 amino acids in M. pneumoniae M129 were considered to have extensions (2 proteins with N-terminus extensions and 9 proteins with C-terminus extensions). Ribosomal protein S3 (COG0092), which has a 17-amino-acid extension at the C terminus, was also retained for further analysis. NCBI bacterial taxonomy file new_taxdump.zip was downloaded from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/ (version on 24 April 2021). The file names.dmp was used to map NCBI IDs to taxonomy names. Tree was reconstructed from the file taxidlineage.dmp in Python v.3.7.7 with ETE3 Toolkit v.3.1.2 (ref. 73). EggNOG protein IDs containing NCBI species IDs were directly mapped to the NCBI tree nodes. The presence of ribosomal protein extensions was saved as tables and converted to iTOL format with table2itol utility (https://github.com/mgoeker/table2itol) in R v.3.6.1. The tree was visualized with iTOL v.6 (ref. 71).\n",
      "Sequences for the 11 ribosomal proteins annotated with extensions in M. pneumoniae, and their orthologues in other species, were further analysed in terms of protein disorder and secondary structures. For disorder prediction, all protein sequences from the multiple sequence alignment files were saved in FASTA format without gaps. The IUPred2A tool in Python v.3.7.7 was run with the input parameter 'long' for each protein sequence74. The number of disordered amino acids and disorder length in extended regions were calculated on the basis of the position of the extended region relative to E. coli, and an IUPred2A score of 0.5 was used as the disorder threshold. The JPred prediction tool75 was used to predict the secondary structure of each protein using the jpredapi utility and JPred-big-batch-submission utility for a large number of submissions (https://github.com/fabianegli/JPred-big-batch-submission). The number of helices in extended regions was calculated on the basis of the position of the extended region relative to E. coli protein.\n",
      "For the 11 ribosomal proteins with extensions in M. pneumoniae, the positions of cross-links linking to the same protein or a different protein were mapped according to the amino acid cross-link positions reported previously2. To analyse transposon insertions in M. pneumoniae ribosomal proteins with extensions, the supplementary materials from a previous publication24 were used. All the files in the 'SupplementaryData1_fastqins_processed.zip folder' (files with extension '.qins' but not '_fw.qins' or '_rv.qins') were concatenated to obtain a list of nucleotide coordinates of transposon insertions in the sequence of M. pneumoniae M129 NC_000912.1. The transposon insertion locations in the 11 ribosomal proteins were selected on the basis of their genomic locations as per RefSeq annotations (GCF_000027345.1_ASM2734v1_genomic.gff). Nucleotide locations were converted to amino acid locations by calculating the difference between each transposon location and the start coordinate of the corresponding gene and dividing the number of nucleotides by three.

Two proteins, WP_010874426.1 and WP_010874827.1, were mapped to the same COG0267 corresponding to the ribosomal protein L33. Multiple sequence alignments for the annotated proteins from representative bacterial species were downloaded from the eggNOG v5.0 database69. For each of the 51 COG IDs mapping to ribosomal proteins in M. pneumoniae, the trimmed alignments were downloaded from http://eggnogapi5.embl.de/nog_data/text/trimmed_alg/COG_ID ('COG_ID' in the url should be changed to the corresponding COG ID). As M. pneumoniae M129 is not among the imported representative species, its sequences were added to the multiple sequence alignments. The sequence of each of the proteins was saved in a separate fasta file, and the MAFFT software v.7.475 was used in the add mode for each alignment as follows: mafft --reorder --add protein.fasta --auto trimmed_alg_COG.fa > output_file (ref. 70). For COG0627, the protein WP_010874827.1 from M. pneumoniae was used.\\nFor each of the ribosomal COGs, the amino acid positions of the protein from the E. coli strain K-12 substr. MG1655 was taken as a reference, and for each protein from representative species (including M. pneumoniae M129), the number of amino acids before the N-terminus and after the C-terminus locations in E. coli was calculated. In total, 11 ribosomal proteins that had N- or C-terminus extensions of more than 20 amino acids in M. pneumoniae M129 were considered to have extensions (2 proteins with N-terminus extensions and 9 proteins with C-terminus extensions). Ribosomal protein S3 (COG0092), which has a 17-amino-acid extension at the C terminus, was also retained for further analysis. NCBI bacterial taxonomy file new_taxdump.zip was downloaded from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/ (version on 24 April 2021). The file names.dmp was used to map NCBI IDs to taxonomy names. Tree was reconstructed from the file taxidlineage.dmp in Python v.3.7.7 with ETE3 Toolkit v.3.1.2 (ref. 73). EggNOG protein IDs containing NCBI species IDs were directly mapped to the NCBI tree nodes. The presence of ribosomal protein extensions was saved as tables and converted to iTOL format with table2itol utility (https://github.com/mgoeker/table2itol) in R v.3.6.1. The tree was visualized with iTOL v.6 (ref. 71).\\nSequences for the 11 ribosomal proteins annotated with extensions in M. pneumoniae, and their orthologues in other species, were further analysed in terms of protein disorder and secondary structures. For disorder prediction, all protein sequences from the multiple sequence alignment files were saved in FASTA format without gaps. The IUPred2A tool in Python v.3.7.7 was run with the input parameter 'long' for each protein sequence74. The number of disordered amino acids and disorder length in extended regions were calculated on the basis of the position of the extended region relative to E. coli, and an IUPred2A score of 0.5 was used as the disorder threshold. The JPred prediction tool75 was used to predict the secondary structure of each protein using the jpredapi utility and JPred-big-batch-submission utility for a large number of submissions (https://github.com/fabianegli/JPred-big-batch-submission). The number of helices in extended regions was calculated on the basis of the position of the extended region relative to E. coli protein.\\nFor the 11 ribosomal proteins with extensions in M. pneumoniae, the positions of cross-links linking to the same protein or a different protein were mapped according to the amino acid cross-link positions reported previously2. To analyse transposon insertions in M. pneumoniae ribosomal proteins with extensions, the supplementary materials from a previous publication24 were used. All the files in the 'SupplementaryData1_fastqins_processed.zip folder' (files with extension '.qins' but not '_fw.qins' or '_rv.qins') were concatenated to obtain a list of nucleotide coordinates of transposon insertions in the sequence of M. pneumoniae M129 NC_000912.1. The transposon insertion locations in the 11 ribosomal proteins were selected on the basis of their genomic locations as per RefSeq annotations (GCF_000027345.1_ASM2734v1_genomic.gff). Nucleotide locations were converted to amino acid locations by calculating the difference between each transposon location and the start coordinate of the corresponding gene and dividing the number of nucleotides by three. All data were mapped to the protein sequences to derive Extended Data Fig. 3.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.

      "Maximum-likelihood 3D classification76 was performed in RELION 3.0 (refs. 58,59) with the re-extracted ribosome sub-tomograms after M refinement. A hierarchical and exhaustive classification strategy (Supplementary Discussion) with at least three tiers was used to handle the heterogeneity in the native untreated dataset, which is described here in detail and illustrated in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5. A similar procedure was applied for all antibiotics-treated datasets, and is detailed in Extended Data Figs. 9-11.\n",
      "In the first tier, 109,990 sub-tomograms were classified into 70S and free 50S with a global spherical mask (320-A diameter). The 24,157 free 50S were further classified into two classes, with a local spherical mask focusing on the ribosome recycling factor binding site. Before extensive 70S classification, structural heterogeneity was evaluated by visual inspection, multibody refinement and test classification runs in RELION. Classification set-ups were extensively tested, including different masks (global 70S mask, local 30S mask, spherical tRNA path mask, solvent tRNA path mask, spherical EF mask, solvent EF mask), initial references (ribosome average, features-less sphere or none), angular search options (global, local or without alignment) and RELION optimization parameters (class numbers 2-16, T values 2-10, iterations 25-40, limit resolution E-step 5-10 A). To avoid bias, we mostly used a sphere or other featureless shapes with soft edges as the mask. Local spherical masks covering factors (elongation factors and/or tRNAs) generally provided more consistent and stable classification results than those obtained when using larger masks for the untreated data. The class number was made higher than the number of distinct structures that could be retained in one classification job and similar resulting classes were grouped.\n",
      "In the second tier, the 77,539 identified 70S ribosomes were further classified with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask I) focusing on the tRNA path region, roughly covering the A, P and E sites. This resulted in four major classes with different tRNA occupancies: 'P, E', 'a, P/E', 'P' and 'A, P'. In the following rounds, we could further classify the 'a, P/E' class into 'A*, P/E' and 'A/P, P/E'. In addition, a 70S class with only one hybrid 'P/E' tRNA was classified. Two of the resulting classes were not interpretable: 2,150 particles with dim 30S density that were poorly resolved and 1,484 particles with density near the P site that does not resemble a tRNA.\n",
      "In the third tier, focused classification with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask II) around the elongation factor and A/T tRNA binding sites was carried out. For the previous class with 'P, E' tRNAs, further classification resulted in 1,803 particles without additional density, 3,324 particles with EF-G (updated as 'EF-G, ap/P, pe/E') and 4,634 particles with EF-Tu*tRNA. For the classes with partial and full hybrid tRNAs, sub-classes with EF-G were obtained. For the class with only 'P' tRNA, 12,464 particles with additional EF-Tu*tRNA were classified.\n",
      "For each classification step, at least three parallel RELION classification jobs with the same or slightly different parameters (either 30S mask or spherical EF/tRNA mask, local angular search range, class number, T value) were carried out for comparison. The classification job with the most stable result was selected and used for sorting sub-tomograms (Extended Data Fig. 5a-g). After sorting, subsequent validation classification runs were performed for each sorted class to test whether new structures emerge or whether particles were 'wrongly' classified. Misclassified particles were relocated to the corresponding class and the validation runs were repeated until convergence. This approach was performed for all classification steps.

The 24,157 free 50S were further classified into two classes, with a local spherical mask focusing on the ribosome recycling factor binding site. Before extensive 70S classification, structural heterogeneity was evaluated by visual inspection, multibody refinement and test classification runs in RELION. Classification set-ups were extensively tested, including different masks (global 70S mask, local 30S mask, spherical tRNA path mask, solvent tRNA path mask, spherical EF mask, solvent EF mask), initial references (ribosome average, features-less sphere or none), angular search options (global, local or without alignment) and RELION optimization parameters (class numbers 2-16, T values 2-10, iterations 25-40, limit resolution E-step 5-10 A). To avoid bias, we mostly used a sphere or other featureless shapes with soft edges as the mask. Local spherical masks covering factors (elongation factors and/or tRNAs) generally provided more consistent and stable classification results than those obtained when using larger masks for the untreated data. The class number was made higher than the number of distinct structures that could be retained in one classification job and similar resulting classes were grouped.\\nIn the second tier, the 77,539 identified 70S ribosomes were further classified with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask I) focusing on the tRNA path region, roughly covering the A, P and E sites. This resulted in four major classes with different tRNA occupancies: 'P, E', 'a, P/E', 'P' and 'A, P'. In the following rounds, we could further classify the 'a, P/E' class into 'A*, P/E' and 'A/P, P/E'. In addition, a 70S class with only one hybrid 'P/E' tRNA was classified. Two of the resulting classes were not interpretable: 2,150 particles with dim 30S density that were poorly resolved and 1,484 particles with density near the P site that does not resemble a tRNA.\\nIn the third tier, focused classification with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask II) around the elongation factor and A/T tRNA binding sites was carried out. For the previous class with 'P, E' tRNAs, further classification resulted in 1,803 particles without additional density, 3,324 particles with EF-G (updated as 'EF-G, ap/P, pe/E') and 4,634 particles with EF-Tu*tRNA. For the classes with partial and full hybrid tRNAs, sub-classes with EF-G were obtained. For the class with only 'P' tRNA, 12,464 particles with additional EF-Tu*tRNA were classified.\\nFor each classification step, at least three parallel RELION classification jobs with the same or slightly different parameters (either 30S mask or spherical EF/tRNA mask, local angular search range, class number, T value) were carried out for comparison. The classification job with the most stable result was selected and used for sorting sub-tomograms (Extended Data Fig. 5a-g). After sorting, subsequent validation classification runs were performed for each sorted class to test whether new structures emerge or whether particles were 'wrongly' classified. Misclassified particles were relocated to the corresponding class and the validation runs were repeated until convergence. This approach was performed for all classification steps. For each of the final classes, refinement and post-processing were done in RELION. Further classification performed with the new refinement results as inputs did not generate any new classes.\"\n",

A similar procedure was applied for all antibiotics-treated datasets, and is detailed in Extended Data Figs. 9-11.\\nIn the first tier, 109,990 sub-tomograms were classified into 70S and free 50S with a global spherical mask (320-A diameter). The 24,157 free 50S were further classified into two classes, with a local spherical mask focusing on the ribosome recycling factor binding site. Before extensive 70S classification, structural heterogeneity was evaluated by visual inspection, multibody refinement and test classification runs in RELION. Classification set-ups were extensively tested, including different masks (global 70S mask, local 30S mask, spherical tRNA path mask, solvent tRNA path mask, spherical EF mask, solvent EF mask), initial references (ribosome average, features-less sphere or none), angular search options (global, local or without alignment) and RELION optimization parameters (class numbers 2-16, T values 2-10, iterations 25-40, limit resolution E-step 5-10 A). To avoid bias, we mostly used a sphere or other featureless shapes with soft edges as the mask. Local spherical masks covering factors (elongation factors and/or tRNAs) generally provided more consistent and stable classification results than those obtained when using larger masks for the untreated data. The class number was made higher than the number of distinct structures that could be retained in one classification job and similar resulting classes were grouped.\\nIn the second tier, the 77,539 identified 70S ribosomes were further classified with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask I) focusing on the tRNA path region, roughly covering the A, P and E sites. This resulted in four major classes with different tRNA occupancies: 'P, E', 'a, P/E', 'P' and 'A, P'. In the following rounds, we could further classify the 'a, P/E' class into 'A*, P/E' and 'A/P, P/E'. In addition, a 70S class with only one hybrid 'P/E' tRNA was classified. Two of the resulting classes were not interpretable: 2,150 particles with dim 30S density that were poorly resolved and 1,484 particles with density near the P site that does not resemble a tRNA.\\nIn the third tier, focused classification with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask II) around the elongation factor and A/T tRNA binding sites was carried out. For the previous class with 'P, E' tRNAs, further classification resulted in 1,803 particles without additional density, 3,324 particles with EF-G (updated as 'EF-G, ap/P, pe/E') and 4,634 particles with EF-Tu*tRNA. For the classes with partial and full hybrid tRNAs, sub-classes with EF-G were obtained. For the class with only 'P' tRNA, 12,464 particles with additional EF-Tu*tRNA were classified.\\nFor each classification step, at least three parallel RELION classification jobs with the same or slightly different parameters (either 30S mask or spherical EF/tRNA mask, local angular search range, class number, T value) were carried out for comparison. The classification job with the most stable result was selected and used for sorting sub-tomograms (Extended Data Fig. 5a-g). After sorting, subsequent validation classification runs were performed for each sorted class to test whether new structures emerge or whether particles were 'wrongly' classified. Misclassified particles were relocated to the corresponding class and the validation runs were repeated until convergence. This approach was performed for all classification steps.

A hierarchical and exhaustive classification strategy (Supplementary Discussion) with at least three tiers was used to handle the heterogeneity in the native untreated dataset, which is described here in detail and illustrated in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5. A similar procedure was applied for all antibiotics-treated datasets, and is detailed in Extended Data Figs. 9-11.\\nIn the first tier, 109,990 sub-tomograms were classified into 70S and free 50S with a global spherical mask (320-A diameter). The 24,157 free 50S were further classified into two classes, with a local spherical mask focusing on the ribosome recycling factor binding site. Before extensive 70S classification, structural heterogeneity was evaluated by visual inspection, multibody refinement and test classification runs in RELION. Classification set-ups were extensively tested, including different masks (global 70S mask, local 30S mask, spherical tRNA path mask, solvent tRNA path mask, spherical EF mask, solvent EF mask), initial references (ribosome average, features-less sphere or none), angular search options (global, local or without alignment) and RELION optimization parameters (class numbers 2-16, T values 2-10, iterations 25-40, limit resolution E-step 5-10 A). To avoid bias, we mostly used a sphere or other featureless shapes with soft edges as the mask. Local spherical masks covering factors (elongation factors and/or tRNAs) generally provided more consistent and stable classification results than those obtained when using larger masks for the untreated data. The class number was made higher than the number of distinct structures that could be retained in one classification job and similar resulting classes were grouped.\\nIn the second tier, the 77,539 identified 70S ribosomes were further classified with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask I) focusing on the tRNA path region, roughly covering the A, P and E sites. This resulted in four major classes with different tRNA occupancies: 'P, E', 'a, P/E', 'P' and 'A, P'. In the following rounds, we could further classify the 'a, P/E' class into 'A*, P/E' and 'A/P, P/E'. In addition, a 70S class with only one hybrid 'P/E' tRNA was classified.

Classification set-ups were extensively tested, including different masks (global 70S mask, local 30S mask, spherical tRNA path mask, solvent tRNA path mask, spherical EF mask, solvent EF mask), initial references (ribosome average, features-less sphere or none), angular search options (global, local or without alignment) and RELION optimization parameters (class numbers 2-16, T values 2-10, iterations 25-40, limit resolution E-step 5-10 A). To avoid bias, we mostly used a sphere or other featureless shapes with soft edges as the mask. Local spherical masks covering factors (elongation factors and/or tRNAs) generally provided more consistent and stable classification results than those obtained when using larger masks for the untreated data. The class number was made higher than the number of distinct structures that could be retained in one classification job and similar resulting classes were grouped.\\nIn the second tier, the 77,539 identified 70S ribosomes were further classified with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask I) focusing on the tRNA path region, roughly covering the A, P and E sites. This resulted in four major classes with different tRNA occupancies: 'P, E', 'a, P/E', 'P' and 'A, P'. In the following rounds, we could further classify the 'a, P/E' class into 'A*, P/E' and 'A/P, P/E'. In addition, a 70S class with only one hybrid 'P/E' tRNA was classified. Two of the resulting classes were not interpretable: 2,150 particles with dim 30S density that were poorly resolved and 1,484 particles with density near the P site that does not resemble a tRNA.\\nIn the third tier, focused classification with a local mask (Extended Data Fig. 4a, mask II) around the elongation factor and A/T tRNA binding sites was carried out. For the previous class with 'P, E' tRNAs, further classification resulted in 1,803 particles without additional density, 3,324 particles with EF-G (updated as 'EF-G, ap/P, pe/E') and 4,634 particles with EF-Tu*tRNA. For the classes with partial and full hybrid tRNAs, sub-classes with EF-G were obtained. For the class with only 'P' tRNA, 12,464 particles with additional EF-Tu*tRNA were classified.\\nFor each classification step, at least three parallel RELION classification jobs with the same or slightly different parameters (either 30S mask or spherical EF/tRNA mask, local angular search range, class number, T value) were carried out for comparison. The classification job with the most stable result was selected and used for sorting sub-tomograms (Extended Data Fig. 5a-g). After sorting, subsequent validation classification runs were performed for each sorted class to test whether new structures emerge or whether particles were 'wrongly' classified. Misclassified particles were relocated to the corresponding class and the validation runs were repeated until convergence. This approach was performed for all classification steps. For each of the final classes, refinement and post-processing were done in RELION. Further classification performed with the new refinement results as inputs did not generate any new classes.'''\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

      "Spatial mapping of ribosomes within cellular tomograms was achieved by projecting back the ribosome structures into the tomograms, with coordinates determined by template matching and shifts and rotations determined by RELION refinement. The projection was performed using the TOM toolbox80 after Euler angle format conversion, at four times binning (voxel size 6.8 A). To calculate the ribosome concentration, we first estimated the cellular volume covered in the tomogram and then divided the total number of detected ribosomes by the volume.\n",
      "Detection of the polysomes was based on both position and orientation information (Extended Data Fig. 12c), using a custom script in MATLAB 2016b. It is noted that the annotated polysomes only refer to those assembled closely in space and thus can be detected on the basis of their spatial proximity. The positions of mRNA entry and exit sites for all 70S ribosomes were calculated on the basis of the rotations and shifts determined during RELION refinement. The distances from the mRNA exit site of one ribosome (defined as the preceding ribosome i) to the mRNA entry sites of all neighbouring ribosomes (as potential following ribosomes i+1) were calculated. A distance threshold of 7 nm was used to define whether two ribosomes belong to the same polysome. The calculation and polysome definition were done for all 70S ribosomes. A unique identifier was assigned to each polysome, as well as the sequential number for all ribosomes within the polysome.\n",
      "The distribution of relative positions of adjacent ribosomes within the polysome--that is, the position of the following ribosome (i+1) relative to the preceding ribosome (i)--was analysed after normalizing the relative position vectors with rotations of the preceding ribosome determined from RELION refinement. The relative rotation of the following ribosome to the preceding ribosome was represented as three Euler angles (psi, theta, phi in XYZ system). Using the k-means clustering function in MATLAB 2016b, we determined two major arrangement configurations for adjacent ribosomes within the polysome; that is, how the following ribosome rotates relative to the preceding ribosome (as shown in Extended Data Fig. 12f,g). These two configurations are identical to the previously reported 'top-top' (t-t) and 'top-back' (t-b) configurations4, and the naming was adopted.\n",
      "To further refine the ribosome-ribosome interface in polysomes, RELION classification was performed with sub-tomograms extracted with a large box size that can accommodate two ribosomes. After refinement on the preceding ribosome (i), classification without refinement was performed with a local mask focusing on the following ribosome (i+1). Only ribosome pairs within tightly packed polysomes (5,083 pairs from 5 di-ribosome classes; all with a 't-t' arrangement and extended L9 in between) resulted in average densities with both ribosomes well resolved. Models for the resulting classes were generated with rigid-body-fitting of the above described  ribosome models and the L9 homology model with the extended conformation (PDB 4V63).\n",

The projection was performed using the TOM toolbox80 after Euler angle format conversion, at four times binning (voxel size 6.8 A). To calculate the ribosome concentration, we first estimated the cellular volume covered in the tomogram and then divided the total number of detected ribosomes by the volume.\\nDetection of the polysomes was based on both position and orientation information (Extended Data Fig. 12c), using a custom script in MATLAB 2016b. It is noted that the annotated polysomes only refer to those assembled closely in space and thus can be detected on the basis of their spatial proximity. The positions of mRNA entry and exit sites for all 70S ribosomes were calculated on the basis of the rotations and shifts determined during RELION refinement. The distances from the mRNA exit site of one ribosome (defined as the preceding ribosome i) to the mRNA entry sites of all neighbouring ribosomes (as potential following ribosomes i+1) were calculated. A distance threshold of 7 nm was used to define whether two ribosomes belong to the same polysome. The calculation and polysome definition were done for all 70S ribosomes. A unique identifier was assigned to each polysome, as well as the sequential number for all ribosomes within the polysome.\\nThe distribution of relative positions of adjacent ribosomes within the polysome--that is, the position of the following ribosome (i+1) relative to the preceding ribosome (i)--was analysed after normalizing the relative position vectors with rotations of the preceding ribosome determined from RELION refinement. The relative rotation of the following ribosome to the preceding ribosome was represented as three Euler angles (psi, theta, phi in XYZ system). Using the k-means clustering function in MATLAB 2016b, we determined two major arrangement configurations for adjacent ribosomes within the polysome; that is, how the following ribosome rotates relative to the preceding ribosome (as shown in Extended Data Fig. 12f,g). These two configurations are identical to the previously reported 'top-top' (t-t) and 'top-back' (t-b) configurations4, and the naming was adopted.\\nTo further refine the ribosome-ribosome interface in polysomes, RELION classification was performed with sub-tomograms extracted with a large box size that can accommodate two ribosomes. After refinement on the preceding ribosome (i), classification without refinement was performed with a local mask focusing on the following ribosome (i+1). Only ribosome pairs within tightly packed polysomes (5,083 pairs from 5 di-ribosome classes; all with a 't-t' arrangement and extended L9 in between) resulted in average densities with both ribosomes well resolved. Models for the resulting classes were generated with rigid-body-fitting of the above described  ribosome models and the L9 homology model with the extended conformation (PDB 4V63).'''\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

      "To compare the experimental elongation state frequencies in polysomes with theoretical frequencies, the distributions of frequencies of each elongation state calculated across 356 tomograms of the untreated cells were compared between polysomes and all ribosomes, and between polysomes and mono-ribosomes by calculating the fold change between distribution medians. Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test using the ranksum function in MATLAB 2019b. The theoretical frequency of each ribosome pair was calculated as the product of the overall frequencies of the ribosome classes for the preceding ribosome (i) and the following ribosome (i+1). Experimental polysome pair frequencies were calculated by summarizing the numbers of all ribosome pairs engaged in polysomes, and dividing these numbers by the total number of pairs. Experimental and theoretical pair frequencies were compared by calculating the fold change per pair.\n",
      "Permutation analysis was performed to test the significance of differences between occurrence frequencies of the experimental pairs compared to the theoretical pairs. The ribosome pair sequences in polysomes were represented as a matrix with single polysomes as rows and ribosome positions as columns, in which each matrix cell contains the ribosome class representing its elongation state. Columns with positions beyond each ribosome's length were assigned to NaN (not-a-number). All polysomes across all tomograms were combined in one matrix (8,641 polysomes in total). For permutation analysis, all elements of the polysome matrix were randomly shuffled for 10,000 times with the randperm function in MATLAB 2019b. For each row, the elements were sorted so that the ribosome classes are in the front columns followed by NaNs occurring in the same row after shuffling. Rows with fewer than two ribosomes in the sequence were deleted. Shuffled ribosome pair frequencies were calculated in the same way as experimental pair frequencies. The permutation P value for each ribosome pair was calculated as the minimum between the number of permutations in which the pair frequency was less or equal to the experimentally observed frequency divided by the total number of permutations, and the one minus this value. Permutation P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the mafdr function in MATLAB 2019b with parameters ('bhfdr', 'true').\n",

Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test using the ranksum function in MATLAB 2019b. The theoretical frequency of each ribosome pair was calculated as the product of the overall frequencies of the ribosome classes for the preceding ribosome (i) and the following ribosome (i+1). Experimental polysome pair frequencies were calculated by summarizing the numbers of all ribosome pairs engaged in polysomes, and dividing these numbers by the total number of pairs. Experimental and theoretical pair frequencies were compared by calculating the fold change per pair.\\nPermutation analysis was performed to test the significance of differences between occurrence frequencies of the experimental pairs compared to the theoretical pairs. The ribosome pair sequences in polysomes were represented as a matrix with single polysomes as rows and ribosome positions as columns, in which each matrix cell contains the ribosome class representing its elongation state. Columns with positions beyond each ribosome's length were assigned to NaN (not-a-number). All polysomes across all tomograms were combined in one matrix (8,641 polysomes in total). For permutation analysis, all elements of the polysome matrix were randomly shuffled for 10,000 times with the randperm function in MATLAB 2019b. For each row, the elements were sorted so that the ribosome classes are in the front columns followed by NaNs occurring in the same row after shuffling. Rows with fewer than two ribosomes in the sequence were deleted. Shuffled ribosome pair frequencies were calculated in the same way as experimental pair frequencies. The permutation P value for each ribosome pair was calculated as the minimum between the number of permutations in which the pair frequency was less or equal to the experimentally observed frequency divided by the total number of permutations, and the one minus this value. Permutation P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the mafdr function in MATLAB 2019b with parameters ('bhfdr', 'true').\\nFor polysome distance threshold analysis, matrices were created from the full ribosome dataset by varying the distance threshold to the nearest neighbour in the range from 3 to 10 nm.

Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test using the ranksum function in MATLAB 2019b. The theoretical frequency of each ribosome pair was calculated as the product of the overall frequencies of the ribosome classes for the preceding ribosome (i) and the following ribosome (i+1). Experimental polysome pair frequencies were calculated by summarizing the numbers of all ribosome pairs engaged in polysomes, and dividing these numbers by the total number of pairs. Experimental and theoretical pair frequencies were compared by calculating the fold change per pair.\\nPermutation analysis was performed to test the significance of differences between occurrence frequencies of the experimental pairs compared to the theoretical pairs. The ribosome pair sequences in polysomes were represented as a matrix with single polysomes as rows and ribosome positions as columns, in which each matrix cell contains the ribosome class representing its elongation state. Columns with positions beyond each ribosome's length were assigned to NaN (not-a-number). All polysomes across all tomograms were combined in one matrix (8,641 polysomes in total). For permutation analysis, all elements of the polysome matrix were randomly shuffled for 10,000 times with the randperm function in MATLAB 2019b. For each row, the elements were sorted so that the ribosome classes are in the front columns followed by NaNs occurring in the same row after shuffling. Rows with fewer than two ribosomes in the sequence were deleted. Shuffled ribosome pair frequencies were calculated in the same way as experimental pair frequencies. The permutation P value for each ribosome pair was calculated as the minimum between the number of permutations in which the pair frequency was less or equal to the experimentally observed frequency divided by the total number of permutations, and the one minus this value. Permutation P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the mafdr function in MATLAB 2019b with parameters ('bhfdr', 'true').\\nFor polysome distance threshold analysis, matrices were created from the full ribosome dataset by varying the distance threshold to the nearest neighbour in the range from 3 to 10 nm. The distances for polysome definition were calculated between the mRNA exit site of one ribosome and the mRNA entry site of another ribosome as described above. The fractions of elongation states in ribosome pairs were calculated as for the original ribosome set (with the threshold of 7 nm). For each distance threshold and each ribosome class, the ratio between the number of pairs in which the preceding ribosome has this class and the number of pairs in which the following ribosome has this class was calculated.'''\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test using the ranksum function in MATLAB 2019b. The theoretical frequency of each ribosome pair was calculated as the product of the overall frequencies of the ribosome classes for the preceding ribosome (i) and the following ribosome (i+1). Experimental polysome pair frequencies were calculated by summarizing the numbers of all ribosome pairs engaged in polysomes, and dividing these numbers by the total number of pairs. Experimental and theoretical pair frequencies were compared by calculating the fold change per pair.\\nPermutation analysis was performed to test the significance of differences between occurrence frequencies of the experimental pairs compared to the theoretical pairs. The ribosome pair sequences in polysomes were represented as a matrix with single polysomes as rows and ribosome positions as columns, in which each matrix cell contains the ribosome class representing its elongation state. Columns with positions beyond each ribosome's length were assigned to NaN (not-a-number). All polysomes across all tomograms were combined in one matrix (8,641 polysomes in total). For permutation analysis, all elements of the polysome matrix were randomly shuffled for 10,000 times with the randperm function in MATLAB 2019b. For each row, the elements were sorted so that the ribosome classes are in the front columns followed by NaNs occurring in the same row after shuffling. Rows with fewer than two ribosomes in the sequence were deleted. Shuffled ribosome pair frequencies were calculated in the same way as experimental pair frequencies. The permutation P value for each ribosome pair was calculated as the minimum between the number of permutations in which the pair frequency was less or equal to the experimentally observed frequency divided by the total number of permutations, and the one minus this value. Permutation P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the mafdr function in MATLAB 2019b with parameters ('bhfdr', 'true').\\nFor polysome distance threshold analysis, matrices were created from the full ribosome dataset by varying the distance threshold to the nearest neighbour in the range from 3 to 10 nm. The distances for polysome definition were calculated between the mRNA exit site of one ribosome and the mRNA entry site of another ribosome as described above. The fractions of elongation states in ribosome pairs were calculated as for the original ribosome set (with the threshold of 7 nm).

Another use is for scientific observation, as in a Mössbauer spectrometer. The most common type is a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which has been used on many space probes and on crewed lunar missions. Small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, have also been flown.[1] A radioisotope heater unit is powered by radioactive decay and can keep components from becoming too cold to function, potentially over a span of decades.[2]\n",
