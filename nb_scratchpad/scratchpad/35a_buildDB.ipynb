V. cholerae deletion strains were generated using standard allele exchange34 with the following plasmids.\\nPlasmid for deletion of vca1093, vca1094 and vca1095 (pPM045) was constructed by PCR amplification of the up- and down-stream regions of vca1093 and vca1095, respectively. PCR1 was performed with primers CCCCCTCTAGAAATTGGCTAATCCCTCCTAAACTC/AATCTTGCGCAGTTGTTCCATATC and C6706 chromosomal DNA as template. PCR2 was performed with primers GATATGGAACAACTGCGCAAGATT CGCTTAAGCACCACTGCCGAA/CCCCCTCTAGACATCATCAAATTCGTCGTCATGC and C6706 chromosomal DNA as template. A third PCR was then performed using primers CCCCCTCTAGAAATTGGCTAATCCCTCCTAAACTC/CCCCCTCTAGACATCATCAAATTCGTCGTCATGC and PCR1 and PCR2 as template. The product from PCR3 was then digested with XbaI and ligated into the equivalent site of plasmid pCVD44234 resulting in plasmid pPM045.\\nPlasmid for deletion of vca1092 (pPM051) was constructed by PCR amplification of the up- and down-stream regions of vca1092. PCR1 was performed with primers CCCCCTCTAGAACGGTTGTCTTGATCTTGAGTGC/AACAAACTGGGGCACAACCTG and C6706 chromosomal DNA as template.

Both microscopes were equipped with Gatan energy filters and \\\"K2 summit\\\" counting electron detector cameras (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). The data collection software used to collect the tilt series was UCSFtomo38. The cumulative electron dose was 160 e-/A2 or less for each individual tilt series.

Sub-tomogram averaging was carried out with the Dynamo software package42,43. F7 arrays were modeled as patches of surfaces in individual tomograms, and then particles containing IM and baseplate were cropped out based on the geometry of the surface model. Information about the number of cells, particles and pixel sizes are summarized in Supplementary Table 3. Particles were aligned first based on the IM and baseplate density, and then subsequently aligned with in-plane rotations and shifts. 2D tomoslices of the averages represent the top view and the side view of the repeating unit of the F7 arrays. A side view image was used for comparison to the receptor homology models.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not extract any other metadata.\\n[What are the dimensions of the tomogram dataset (measured in numbers of pixels)?]\\nRecord the term 'tomogram_size' in the 'metadata_name' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with three fields 'metadata_name', 'metadata_value' and 'orginal_text'.

The tool is available on node package manager (npm): https://www.npmjs.com/package/sideview-profile-average. The script uses a tomogram and model points that follow the IM at a given 2D slice as input, Supplementary Fig. 6. The final average profile is representative of a 3D tomogram subsection collapsed into 1D. The profiles are in JSON format. The script and instructions for installation and use are available in a GitLab repository at https://gitlab.com/daviortega/sideview-profile-average. The profiles were visualized with the ObservableHQ notebook located at https://beta.observablehq.com/@daviortega/generic-notebook-to-analyse-1d-averaged-electron-density-p. For each profile, we measured the distance between intensity peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron densities of the IM, the CheA/CheW baseplate and intermediate layers. Measurement uncertainty was estimated (coverage factor k = 2) for determining the center of each peak in pixels44. The measurements in Supplementary Table 4 were made using one array, and they agree with the values obtained from measurements in the sub-tomogram averages described above. The general distances reported for the layers in Fig. 2 are averages of the measurements in each organism with propagated uncertainty.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella.

To perform sequence alignments with structural information we used STAMP from the MultiSeq52 tool for VMD v1.9.353 which in turn was used to visualize and manipulate 3D structures. Homology modeling was performed using MODELLER v9.1754. Secondary structure predictions were performed with JNet Structure Predictions55 in the Jalview v2.10.156 software, which was also used to visualize multiple sequence alignments. Similarity searches for sequences were conducted using BLAST v2.7.1+57 and HMMER v3.1b258. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using RAxML v8.2.1059. To collapse branches with low support in phylogenetic trees we used TreeCollapseCL4 v3.060. Sequence logos were built using Weblogo 3.6.061. Tomograms and model points were manipulated using 3dmod v4.9.940.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles.

The files used in this process are described in Supplementary Table 8 and can be found in the Supplementary Data 1.\\nFirst, we built a homology model with two HAMPs followed by the MCPSignal domain that we name 2H + S. For that we used the structures 3ZX6 and the second HAMP of 4I3M to form a chimeric template. We manually aligned the structures of the templates against the Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076) and performed a multiple sequence alignment using L-INS-I and MultiSeq. To construct the homology model of this structure, we use MODELLER with the following parameters: a.library_schedule = autosched.slow, a.max_var_iterations = 1000, a.repeat_optimization = 100 and a.max_molpdf = 1e6. To make sure that the connection between both HAMPs remained the same, we added a restraint in both chains A and B from residues 359 to 385. We built 100 homology models with these parameters and chose the one with the lowest DOPE score.\\nNext, to add a PAS domain to this structure, we used the 3VOL and 4HI4 structures. First, we aligned chain B of 3VOL with the 2H + S homology model produced in the previous step. We noticed that this alignment produced clashes between the PAS domains. To overcome this obstacle, we used chains B and D in the 4HI4 structure as a model for the dimerization of the two PAS domains. We aligned chain B of 4HI4 to the 3VOL structure using the residues QWTDRT and then manually manipulated the dimer of PAS to be positioned in line with the 2H + S model to build the next homology model: P + 2H + S. Sequence alignment was performed as described before against the sequence of Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076). This homology model was used as the basis of the complete homology models of all the Aer2-like receptors.\\nTo build the homology model of Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076), we used the P + 2H + S model together with the 4I3M structure. For that we manually aligned the structures to build the template. However, there is a 13 residues region unresolved in both structures (R156-G169) but predicted to be alpha helical. We assume that these two structures then are around 2.2 nm apart and took that into consideration while positioning the structures. Finally, the homology model was built using MODELLER with the parameters described above and with a restraint to force alpha helical conformation between residues 140 and 181.\\nTo build the homology model of the Aer2-like receptor in V. cholerae (VCA1092) we used the P + 2H + S model together with 4HI4. The sequences of the templates and VCA1092 aligned pretty well with only a minor gap in the residues ELLRD, also predicted to be alpha helical. We aligned the end of chain B of the already aligned 4HI4 used in the P + 2H + S model to the beginning of chain A of P + 2H + P using STAMP and manually adjusted the position of the structures using VMD. The homology model was constructed with MODELLER and we imposed a restraint to force alpha helical conformation between residues 21-43 (C terminal) and 151-171 (unresolved gap).\\nTo build the homology model of the Aer2-like receptor in S. oneidensis (SO_2123) we used the VCA1092 model since they have the same domain architecture. The sequences of the templates and SO_2123 also aligned pretty well with only a minor gap in the residues ESIDA, also predicted to be alpha helical. The C-terminal of the sequence is also predicted to be alpha helical up to the residue PHE7. We aligned the end of chain B of the already aligned 4HI4 used in the P + 2H + S model to the beginning of chain A of P + 2H + P using STAMP and manually adjusted the position the structures using VMD. The homology modeling was performed with MODELLER and we imposed a restraint to force alpha helical conformation between residues 21-43 (C terminal) and 151-171 (unresolved gap).\\nTo build the homology model of the Aer2-like receptor in M. alcaliphilum (MEALZ_2872) we used the P + 2H + S model and the 4I3M structure. To find out which of the 3 HAMPs in the 4I3M structure is most closely related to the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872 we used BLAST to find HAMP sequences in the Pseudomonas group similar to each of the HAMPs in the 4I3M and to the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872. We aligned the sequences using L-INS-I and perform a phylogenetic reconstruction using RAxML with -m PROTGAMMAIAUTO -p 1234555 -x 9876545 -f a -N 100 as parameters. Tree nodes were collapsed to a certainty score of 50. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872 is closely related to the second HAMP of 4IM3. We truncated the 4IM3 structure to contain only the second HAMP and aligned an extended helix connecting to the third HAMP with the PAS domain of the P + 2H + S model. We used this alignment to place the HAMP at the right position and deleted the extended helix. These structures were used as a template for the MEALZ_2872 homology model built with MODELLER as described above and with restraints to force alpha helical conformation in residues 194-216, 255-270, and 721-728.\",\n",

To find out which of the 3 HAMPs in the 4I3M structure is most closely related to the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872 we used BLAST to find HAMP sequences in the Pseudomonas group similar to each of the HAMPs in the 4I3M and to the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872. We aligned the sequences using L-INS-I and perform a phylogenetic reconstruction using RAxML with -m PROTGAMMAIAUTO -p 1234555 -x 9876545 -f a -N 100 as parameters. Tree nodes were collapsed to a certainty score of 50. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the C-terminal HAMP of MEALZ_2872 is closely related to the second HAMP of 4IM3. We truncated the 4IM3 structure to contain only the second HAMP and aligned an extended helix connecting to the third HAMP with the PAS domain of the P + 2H + S model. We used this alignment to place the HAMP at the right position and deleted the extended helix. These structures were used as a template for the MEALZ_2872 homology model built with MODELLER as described above and with restraints to force alpha helical conformation in residues 194-216, 255-270, and 721-728.\",\n",

The files used in this process are described in Supplementary Table 8 and can be found in the Supplementary Data 1.\\nFirst, we built a homology model with two HAMPs followed by the MCPSignal domain that we name 2H + S. For that we used the structures 3ZX6 and the second HAMP of 4I3M to form a chimeric template. We manually aligned the structures of the templates against the Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076) and performed a multiple sequence alignment using L-INS-I and MultiSeq. To construct the homology model of this structure, we use MODELLER with the following parameters: a.library_schedule = autosched.slow, a.max_var_iterations = 1000, a.repeat_optimization = 100 and a.max_molpdf = 1e6. To make sure that the connection between both HAMPs remained the same, we added a restraint in both chains A and B from residues 359 to 385. We built 100 homology models with these parameters and chose the one with the lowest DOPE score.\\nNext, to add a PAS domain to this structure, we used the 3VOL and 4HI4 structures. First, we aligned chain B of 3VOL with the 2H + S homology model produced in the previous step. We noticed that this alignment produced clashes between the PAS domains. To overcome this obstacle, we used chains B and D in the 4HI4 structure as a model for the dimerization of the two PAS domains. We aligned chain B of 4HI4 to the 3VOL structure using the residues QWTDRT and then manually manipulated the dimer of PAS to be positioned in line with the 2H + S model to build the next homology model: P + 2H + S. Sequence alignment was performed as described before against the sequence of Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076). This homology model was used as the basis of the complete homology models of all the Aer2-like receptors.\\nTo build the homology model of Aer2 in P. aeruginosa (PA1076), we used the P + 2H + S model together with the 4I3M structure. For that we manually aligned the structures to build the template. However, there is a 13 residues region unresolved in both structures (R156-G169) but predicted to be alpha helical. We assume that these two structures then are around 2.2 nm apart and took that into consideration while positioning the structures. Finally, the homology model was built using MODELLER with the parameters described above and with a restraint to force alpha helical conformation between residues 140 and 181.\\nTo build the homology model of the Aer2-like receptor in V. cholerae (VCA1092) we used the P + 2H + S model together with 4HI4. The sequences of the templates and VCA1092 aligned pretty well with only a minor gap in the residues ELLRD, also predicted to be alpha helical. We aligned the end of chain B of the already aligned 4HI4 used in the P + 2H + S model to the beginning of chain A of P + 2H + P using STAMP and manually adjusted the position of the structures using VMD. The homology model was constructed with MODELLER and we imposed a restraint to force alpha helical conformation between residues 21-43 (C terminal) and 151-171 (unresolved gap).\\nTo build the homology model of the Aer2-like receptor in S. oneidensis (SO_2123) we used the VCA1092 model since they have the same domain architecture. The sequences of the templates and SO_2123 also aligned pretty well with only a minor gap in the residues ESIDA, also predicted to be alpha helical. The C-terminal of the sequence is also predicted to be alpha helical up to the residue PHE7.

      "  \"section_text\": \"Phylogenetic tree of F7 systems in proteobacteria\\nTo build a tree of the F7 and F8 systems in proteobacteria we used a concatenated alignment of the protein sequences of CheA, CheB, and CheR, as previously described9. We first collected every CheA belonging to these two classes from 1152 proteobacteria genomes in MiST (547 from F7 class and 168 from F8 class) and used CD-HIT to eliminate redundancy at the 85% identity level (201 from F7 class and 119 from F8 class). To find CheB and CheR proteins that confidently function with the selected CheAs, we searched for genes that code for these proteins in the range of ten genes upstream and downstream from each cheA gene. Conflicts of multiple or missing cheB, cheR, or cheA genes within that range were manually resolved or the system was removed from the dataset. At this stage the dataset contained 272 protein sequences of CheAs, CheBs, and CheRs. We aligned each protein individually with L-INS-I from MAFFT. We used Jalview to examine the alignment and removed ten sequences for not being complete genes and realigned the sequences with L-INS-I. The final dataset had 262 sequences from F7 (168) and F8 (94) systems from 246 genomes. For each protein family, we used Gblocks to remove alignment positions with low information. The Gblock parameters were: b3 = 8 -b4 = 10 b5 = h. The resulting alignments of the protein sequences of CheA, CheB and CheR were concatenated into a single alignment with 698 columns. We used RAxML with parameters -m PROTGAMMAIAUTO -f d -d -N 25 with different seeds 10 times and 3 partitions set to evolutionary model AUTO with boundaries 1-312, 313-559, and 560-698 to accommodate possible differences in the evolutionary models selected for CheA, CheB, and CheR sequences. We selected the tree with best maximum likelihood score. We also ran 1000 rapid bootstrap on the same alignment with the parameters -m PROTGAMMAIAUTO -p 1234555 -x 9876545 -f a -N 1000. We mapped these bootstrap values to the best tree and used TreeCollapseCL4 to collapse nodes with less than 50% uncertainty to polytomies. To find an appropriate rooting point, we built an auxiliary phylogenetic inference that included sequences from the ancient class F1 as an outgroup (Supplementary Fig. 1--inlet). Following the exact same protocol, we also generated an auxiliary phylogeny that contained the same sequences and included the CheABR of three systems from the class F1 (B. subtilis, Thermatoga maritima, and Clostridium thermocellum), Supplementary Fig. 1--inlet. Although our analysis was unable to unambiguously determine the exact placement of the last common ancestor of the classes F7 and F8, it showed a polytomy more ancient than all F7 in both gamma- and beta-proteobacteria. We chose to root the CheABR phylogeny separating the F7 present in most alpha, gamma, and beta-proteobacteria from the rest of the sequences from the F7 and F8 classes, coherent with the CheABR analysis of Wuichet and Zhulin9. We also mapped the CheA gene neighborhoods (15 genes up and downstream) to the CheABR tree using custom scripts written in Python to produce Supplementary Fig. 1. BLAST all vs. all to all CheAs and selected neighboring genes was used to loosely define homologous sets of proteins with at least 10E-40 E-value and query coverage of 95% to any member of the set. As an exception to this rule, the anti-signa factor antagonists were selected with the threshold of 1E-5 and query coverage of 50%. Homologs of relevant proteins are highlighted in different colors.

We defined a protein as a chemoreceptor if it contained the MCPsignal PFAM domain. Then we grouped them in clusters of orthologous groups using the same technique described in ref. 18. To pick Aer2-like receptors we used an E-value of 1E-135 and selected all 144 receptors present in the same group as the Aer2 (PA1076) from P. aeruginosa. From those, we removed six receptors from the beta-proteobacteria outgroup, five that were not classified as 36H receptors, and three other sequences that did not seem to align well with the group. The final set of Aer2-like receptors had 130 Aer2-like receptors and was aligned using L-INS-I and manually inspected with Jalview. Chemoreceptor families and subfamilies are prone to have diverse C-terminal domain architectures so following the procedure in ref. 62, we manually trimmed the sequences to only contain the regions common to all receptors. This final alignment was used to build a phylogenetic tree with RAxML. We built 200 independent inferences with parameters -m PROTGAMMAILG -p 1234555 -f d -d -N 200 and 1000 rapid bootstrap trees with -m PROTGAMMAILG -p 1234555 -x 9876545 -f a -N 1000.

In order to select proteins with one and only one response regulator domain, we collected the domain architecture information from PFAM v30 and predicted transmembrane regions by TMHMM from SeqDepot for all sequences from the 246 genomes and used Regular Architecture (https://www.npmjs.com/package/regarch) to filter only single CheY domains with a specific rule, Supplementary Note 1. This pattern selected 4941 sequences. We then used the same clustering techniques described for Aer2-like and McpA-like receptors with an E-value threshold of 10E-30 and selected the largest group, with 1394 sequences. This group contains the known CheYs of the model organisms in this study and others. We aligned this dataset with L-INS-I and manually removed 3 sequences that were highly divergent using Jalview. We built the tree with 500 rapid bootstraps with RAxML and searched for the best tree of this set with the parameters -m PROTGAMMALG -p 1234555 -x 9876545 -f a -N 500. Finally, we collapsed nodes with less than 50% support into polytomies using TreeCollapseCL4 to produce Fig. 4.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles. (E) reconstructing 3-D tomograms in by aligning tilt series and performing reconstruction computations. (F) annotating the 3D model of the sample to identify structures of interest. (G) other protocol steps, not listed above.\\nIf the text describes other aspects of the work, record 'not present' in the 'protocol_step' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with one field 'protocol_step'.

In all of our simulations, the original membrane cylinder was 160 nm wide and 250 nm in radius. The bead size was set at dmb = 8 nm such that if the distance d between two beads was smaller than dmb, a force Fpush = kpair(dmb - d)2 was applied on each bead to push them apart, where kpair = 1 pN/nm2 was the pairwise force constant. To preserve membrane integrity, a pairwise attraction was implemented between neighboring beads such that if the distance d between two beads was larger than dpair = 16 nm, a force Fpull = kpair(d - dpair)2 was applied on each bead to pull them together. To implement membrane fluidity, the pair list was recalculated every 104 time steps. As different pairs were formed based on the updated positions of the beads, the beads were allowed to move along the membrane. In our previous membrane model (5), a pair was removed from the pair list if it was crossed (looking outward from the center) by a shorter pair. In the current model, to avoid a large change in force on the system as the pair list was recalculated, one degree of crossing was allowed, meaning that a pair was removed from the pair list only if it was crossed by more than one shorter pair.\\nTo check how sensitive our simulations were to changing the value of kpair, we also ran simulations of the filament sliding models with this parameter reduced 10-fold (kpair = 0.1 pN/nm2) and increased 10-fold (kpair = 10 pN/nm2). However, we did not see any effect in the membrane morphology but only a small effect on the constriction rate (see Fig. S14 in the supplemental material).\\nTo implement membrane bending stiffness, if four beads were part of five pairs (Fig. S15), they were constrained to the same plane. If the two diagonals were separated at a distance d, a force Fmb = kmbd was exerted on the beads to pull the two diagonals together, where kmb was a force constant. To derive kmb, we first built a coarse-grained model of the membrane as a cylindrical sheet of beads with length L = 160 nm and radius R = 250 nm. We calculated the bending energy of this membrane model Emb_sim=2sumkmbd2/2 (the factor of 2 comes from the fact that Fmb was exerted on four beads). Next, using an experimentally reported membrane bending stiffness km_exp ~ 2 . 10-19 J (59), we calculated the bending energy of a cylindrical membrane as Emb_exp = km_exppiL/R. Comparing the two energy calculations, we derived kmb to be 8 pN/nm.\\nSimilar to our previous membrane model (5), to prevent boundary artifacts, we implemented a periodic boundary condition such that images of the beads on one longitudinal edge were translated to interact with the beads on the other edge. The translational distance was the same as the membrane width.\",\n",

In all of our simulations, the original membrane cylinder was 160 nm wide and 250 nm in radius. The bead size was set at dmb = 8 nm such that if the distance d between two beads was smaller than dmb, a force Fpush = kpair(dmb - d)2 was applied on each bead to push them apart, where kpair = 1 pN/nm2 was the pairwise force constant. To preserve membrane integrity, a pairwise attraction was implemented between neighboring beads such that if the distance d between two beads was larger than dpair = 16 nm, a force Fpull = kpair(d - dpair)2 was applied on each bead to pull them together. To implement membrane fluidity, the pair list was recalculated every 104 time steps. As different pairs were formed based on the updated positions of the beads, the beads were allowed to move along the membrane. In our previous membrane model (5), a pair was removed from the pair list if it was crossed (looking outward from the center) by a shorter pair. In the current model, to avoid a large change in force on the system as the pair list was recalculated, one degree of crossing was allowed, meaning that a pair was removed from the pair list only if it was crossed by more than one shorter pair.\\nTo check how sensitive our simulations were to changing the value of kpair, we also ran simulations of the filament sliding models with this parameter reduced 10-fold (kpair = 0.1 pN/nm2) and increased 10-fold (kpair = 10 pN/nm2). However, we did not see any effect in the membrane morphology but only a small effect on the constriction rate (see Fig. S14 in the supplemental material).\\nTo implement membrane bending stiffness, if four beads were part of five pairs (Fig. S15), they were constrained to the same plane. If the two diagonals were separated at a distance d, a force Fmb = kmbd was exerted on the beads to pull the two diagonals together, where kmb was a force constant. To derive kmb, we first built a coarse-grained model of the membrane as a cylindrical sheet of beads with length L = 160 nm and radius R = 250 nm. We calculated the bending energy of this membrane model Emb_sim=2sumkmbd2/2 (the factor of 2 comes from the fact that Fmb was exerted on four beads). Next, using an experimentally reported membrane bending stiffness km_exp ~ 2 . 10-19 J (59), we calculated the bending energy of a cylindrical membrane as Emb_exp = km_exppiL/R. Comparing the two energy calculations, we derived kmb to be 8 pN/nm.\\nSimilar to our previous membrane model (5), to prevent boundary artifacts, we implemented a periodic boundary condition such that images of the beads on one longitudinal edge were translated to interact with the beads on the other edge. The translational distance was the same as the membrane width.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella.

The adjacent beads were connected by springs of a relaxed length of lz = 4.4 nm (28) and a spring constant chosen to be kz = 0.5 nN/nm, which was sufficiently large to prevent significant stretching or compression of the filament. If the filament bent an angle theta at a bead, an energy Etheta = ktheta(theta - theta0)2/2 was added to the system, where theta0 = 0degrees was the relaxed angle. We derived the bending stiffness constant as ktheta = kBTLp/lz = 3.8 . 10-18 J, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T = 295 K is room temperature, and Lp = 4 mum is the filament persistence length (60). Note that much smaller values of FtsZ persistence length ~100 nm have also been reported (18, 33).\\nWe implemented a Lennard-Jones potential as a long-range interaction between beads on different filaments (note that interaction of beads on the same filament was excluded). Specifically, a force between two beads at a distance d was calculated as\\n(1)\\nTo implement physical separators to keep different rings apart, if the distance d between two FtsZ beads on two separate rings became smaller than ds = 20 nm, a repulsive force Fs = ks(d - ds) was applied on the beads to push them apart.

To implement this assumption, we modeled the filament as a chain of cubes, with each cube representing one FtsZ monomer (Fig. S9). For convenience, the beads on each cube were denoted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Note that the beads on the interface of two adjacent cubes were shared, meaning beads 5, 6, 7, and 8 of one cube were the same as beads 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the other. The C-terminal face contained beads 1, 2, 6, and 5, and the N-terminal face contained 4, 3, 7, and 8. To maintain the width of the filament, the beads on the two cross-sectional faces (perpendicular to the long axis; one containing 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the other containing 5, 6, 7, and 8) were connected by springs of relaxed length lz = 4.4 nm and spring constant kz = 0.5 nN/nm (Fig. S9A). Note that calculation of the spring force on the interface of two adjacent cubes was done only once for each spring. To maintain the length of the filament, the two cross-sectional faces were connected by two springs of relaxed length lz and spring constant kz. One spring connected edge 1-4 to edge 5-8, and the other connected edge 2-3 to edge 6-7 (Fig. S9B).\\nTo model filament bending, the beads on the C-terminal face were connected by two springs of relaxed length lC and spring constant kb, one spring connecting bead 1 to bead 5 and the other connecting 2 to 6 (Fig. S9B). Likewise, on the N-terminal face, one spring of relaxed length lN and spring constant kb connected bead 3 to bead 7, and another (identical) spring connected 4 to 8. When the filament was in a straight conformation (supposedly GTP-bound), both lC and lN were set to be l0, which was the distance between the two centers of the two cross-sectional faces (Fig. S9B). Note that l0 was not constrained to be constant but varied with the stretching/compression of the filament. When the filament was in a bent conformation (having already hydrolyzed GTP) with a preferred angle thetab between adjacent monomers, lC was set to be l0 + Deltal0 and lN was set to be l0 - Deltal0, where Deltal0=lzsin(thetab2) (Fig. S9C). In the case that reverse bending was assumed, lC was set to be l0 - Deltal0 and lN was set to be l0 + Deltal0. In our simulations, we varied thetab between 1degrees and 20degrees. Considering the distance between adjacent subunits lz = 4.4 nm, bent filaments that form circles with diameters of 250 and 50 nm correspond to thetab = 2degrees and 10degrees, respectively. The spring constant kb was calculated by setting the energy stored in four springs as their length was deformed an amount Deltal0 to be the bending energy of the filament with bending stiffness ktheta (the same constant as in the filament sliding model) as follows:\\n(2)\\nNote that thetab was converted to radians when the bending energy was calculated.\\nTo prevent filament twisting, the two diagonals of each face were constrained to the same length such that if their lengths differed by an amount Deltal, a force Fdiag = kzDeltal was applied on the four beads to restore the lengths to the same value (Fig. S9D).\",\n",

To implement this assumption, we modeled the filament as a chain of cubes, with each cube representing one FtsZ monomer (Fig. S9). For convenience, the beads on each cube were denoted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Note that the beads on the interface of two adjacent cubes were shared, meaning beads 5, 6, 7, and 8 of one cube were the same as beads 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the other. The C-terminal face contained beads 1, 2, 6, and 5, and the N-terminal face contained 4, 3, 7, and 8. To maintain the width of the filament, the beads on the two cross-sectional faces (perpendicular to the long axis; one containing 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the other containing 5, 6, 7, and 8) were connected by springs of relaxed length lz = 4.4 nm and spring constant kz = 0.5 nN/nm (Fig. S9A). Note that calculation of the spring force on the interface of two adjacent cubes was done only once for each spring. To maintain the length of the filament, the two cross-sectional faces were connected by two springs of relaxed length lz and spring constant kz. One spring connected edge 1-4 to edge 5-8, and the other connected edge 2-3 to edge 6-7 (Fig. S9B).\\nTo model filament bending, the beads on the C-terminal face were connected by two springs of relaxed length lC and spring constant kb, one spring connecting bead 1 to bead 5 and the other connecting 2 to 6 (Fig. S9B).

When the filament was in a straight conformation (supposedly GTP-bound), both lC and lN were set to be l0, which was the distance between the two centers of the two cross-sectional faces (Fig. S9B).

To do this, each tetragon was divided into two triangles by one diagonal. Each triangle together with the center point of the cell wall formed a tetrahedron. The total volume V was the sum of Vi, which was the volume of tetrahedron i. The force on each bead j was then calculated as Fj=PtgsumnablajVi.

Three bags of plasma were thawed at 4degreesC overnight to allow clotting, 5 mM EDTA was added to the plasma and the precipitate was collected at 6,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was gaze filtered prior to 2 h incubation at room temperature (RT) with 100 mL Bio-Rex70TM beads (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mM Na2HPO4, 82 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 7.4 (buffer A). The beads were washed extensively with buffer A and packed on a XK16 (GE Healthcare) column. The column was washed with buffer A until baseline and eluted with a 300 mL linear gradient from 82 to 300 mM NaCl. The fractions containing C1q were pooled and a 1:1 v/v ratio of 66% saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution was dripped into the sample while stirring at 4degreesC. After 15 h, the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 30 min and purified C1q was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl pH 7.2 (storage buffer) and dialyzed three times for at least 6 h at 4degreesC against 2.5 L of storage buffer before flash freezing at -80degreesC.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

Three bags of plasma were thawed at 4degreesC overnight to allow clotting, 5 mM EDTA was added to the plasma and the precipitate was collected at 6,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was gaze filtered prior to 2 h incubation at room temperature (RT) with 100 mL Bio-Rex70TM beads (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mM Na2HPO4, 82 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 7.4 (buffer A). The beads were washed extensively with buffer A and packed on a XK16 (GE Healthcare) column. The column was washed with buffer A until baseline and eluted with a 300 mL linear gradient from 82 to 300 mM NaCl. The fractions containing C1q were pooled and a 1:1 v/v ratio of 66% saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution was dripped into the sample while stirring at 4degreesC. After 15 h, the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 30 min and purified C1q was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl pH 7.2 (storage buffer) and dialyzed three times for at least 6 h at 4degreesC against 2.5 L of storage buffer before flash freezing at -80degreesC.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

A llama was immunized four times each with a 100 mug mixture of purified C1q and gC1q, the latter generated by collagenase digestion of C1q (3). After 84 days blood was collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll(R) Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). RNA was purified using a RNeasy(R) Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacture's protocol. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription with the Superscript(R)III First-Strand kit (Invitrogen). Genes were amplified by PCR with VHH specific primers and cloned in to a phagemid vector containing E-tag peptide. Selection was performed in two consecutive rounds of selection. For the first round, 1 mug of C1q in 100 muL PBS was coated in one well of a Maxisorp 96-well plate at 4degreesC ON. Following, the well was added 300 muL PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated at RT for 1 h. Simultaneously, phages were blocked in 100 muL PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at RT. The well was washed with 3 x 300 muL PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and phages were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. The well was washed with 15 x 300 muL PBS-T followed by 15 x 300 muL PBS and phages were eluted by addition of 100 muL 0.2 M glycine pH 2.2. Phages were neutralized by addition of 15 muL Tris pH 9.1 and used for infection of ER2738 cells. Cells were plated on 2xYT agar plates containing 100 mug/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose and incubated ON at 30degreesC. The following day the cells were recovered in 2xYT media and used for generation of phage particles with VCSM13 helper phages. The second round of selection was performed essentially as the first round of selection but now using 0.1 mug C1q. Following this round of selection, single colonies from 2xYT agar plates were inoculated into a 96-well plate containing 200 muL LB media with 100 mug/mL ampicillin. The plate was incubated at 37degreesC for 8 h, added IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated ON at 30degreesC.

A llama was immunized four times each with a 100 mug mixture of purified C1q and gC1q, the latter generated by collagenase digestion of C1q (3). After 84 days blood was collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll(R) Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). RNA was purified using a RNeasy(R) Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacture's protocol. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription with the Superscript(R)III First-Strand kit (Invitrogen). Genes were amplified by PCR with VHH specific primers and cloned in to a phagemid vector containing E-tag peptide. Selection was performed in two consecutive rounds of selection. For the first round, 1 mug of C1q in 100 muL PBS was coated in one well of a Maxisorp 96-well plate at 4degreesC ON. Following, the well was added 300 muL PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated at RT for 1 h. Simultaneously, phages were blocked in 100 muL PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at RT. The well was washed with 3 x 300 muL PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and phages were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. The well was washed with 15 x 300 muL PBS-T followed by 15 x 300 muL PBS and phages were eluted by addition of 100 muL 0.2 M glycine pH 2.2. Phages were neutralized by addition of 15 muL Tris pH 9.1 and used for infection of ER2738 cells. Cells were plated on 2xYT agar plates containing 100 mug/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose and incubated ON at 30degreesC. The following day the cells were recovered in 2xYT media and used for generation of phage particles with VCSM13 helper phages. The second round of selection was performed essentially as the first round of selection but now using 0.1 mug C1q. Following this round of selection, single colonies from 2xYT agar plates were inoculated into a 96-well plate containing 200 muL LB media with 100 mug/mL ampicillin.

Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 mug/mL ampicillin and 0.2% glucose at 37degreesC. At OD600 = 0.6-0.9 IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and incubated at 20degreesC ON. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resolubilized in PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (wash buffer) pH 8.0. Cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads (Protino), washed with wash buffer and eluted with wash buffer containing 300 mM imidazole pH 7.5. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 and loaded on a MonoS 5/10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mM NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing C1qNb75 were concentrated and loaded on a Superdex75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The final yield was approximately one mg/L LB media.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella.

C1qNb75 were immobilized on amine reactive second-generation (AR2G) biosensors at 20 mug/mL in 20 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl pH 5.0. The sensors were quenched with 1 M ethanol amine and equilibrated in kinetics buffer (PBS supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). Association and dissociation were monitored with gC1q concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 10. 9 nM and C1q concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 5.4 nM in kinetics buffer. For gC1q, the data were globally fitted with a 1:1 binding model using the Octet Data Analysis software.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella. (D) imaging the lamella using CryoET by collecting a tilt series of images of the lamella at different angles.

Antibody deficient serum (ADS) was excess material from clinical investigations of a person with antibody deficiency and the use was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 1-16-02-40-12/2007-58-0010) and the Ethics Committee in Central Denmark Region (reference number 1-10-72-127-12). Human IgG antibodies against terminal galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose were affinity isolated from a normal human IgG pool as described (32). Primary incubation of cells, human antibody deficient serum, and antibody was performed in RPMI with HSA at 1 g/L constituting total volumes of 20 muL. The tubes were placed in a 37degreesC water bath and incubated for 2 h. Nanobodies or EDTA were added as stated. Red blood cells were then washed in PBS by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 20 muL PBS containing HSA at 1 mg/mL and secondary antibody (stock solutions diluted 300-fold). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled polyclonal rabbit F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (both from Dako, Denmark). Secondary incubations were done in the dark at RT for 30 min. RBCs were washed again in PBS/HSA and resuspended in 20 muL Streptavidin APC-eFluor780 (eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS/HSA (v/v: 1/300). The cells were mixed and incubated in the dark at RT for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100 muL flow buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) and analyzed on a NovoCyte Quanteon (ACEA Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of experiments were subtracted background fluorescence and expressed relative to the mean of a reference experiment as stated in the text. Background fluorescence was defined as 99.9% of the lowest MFI acquired in associated experiments (99.9% was preferred over 100% to allow use of geometrical means).\",\n",

Antibody deficient serum (ADS) was excess material from clinical investigations of a person with antibody deficiency and the use was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 1-16-02-40-12/2007-58-0010) and the Ethics Committee in Central Denmark Region (reference number 1-10-72-127-12). Human IgG antibodies against terminal galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose were affinity isolated from a normal human IgG pool as described (32). Primary incubation of cells, human antibody deficient serum, and antibody was performed in RPMI with HSA at 1 g/L constituting total volumes of 20 muL. The tubes were placed in a 37degreesC water bath and incubated for 2 h. Nanobodies or EDTA were added as stated. Red blood cells were then washed in PBS by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 20 muL PBS containing HSA at 1 mg/mL and secondary antibody (stock solutions diluted 300-fold). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled polyclonal rabbit F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (both from Dako, Denmark). Secondary incubations were done in the dark at RT for 30 min. RBCs were washed again in PBS/HSA and resuspended in 20 muL Streptavidin APC-eFluor780 (eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS/HSA (v/v: 1/300). The cells were mixed and incubated in the dark at RT for 30 min.

Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of experiments were subtracted background fluorescence and expressed relative to the mean of a reference experiment as stated in the text. Background fluorescence was defined as 99.9% of the lowest MFI acquired in associated experiments (99.9% was preferred over 100% to allow use of geometrical means).\",\n",

Antibody deficient serum (ADS) was excess material from clinical investigations of a person with antibody deficiency and the use was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 1-16-02-40-12/2007-58-0010) and the Ethics Committee in Central Denmark Region (reference number 1-10-72-127-12). Human IgG antibodies against terminal galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose were affinity isolated from a normal human IgG pool as described (32). Primary incubation of cells, human antibody deficient serum, and antibody was performed in RPMI with HSA at 1 g/L constituting total volumes of 20 muL. The tubes were placed in a 37degreesC water bath and incubated for 2 h. Nanobodies or EDTA were added as stated. Red blood cells were then washed in PBS by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 20 muL PBS containing HSA at 1 mg/mL and secondary antibody (stock solutions diluted 300-fold). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled polyclonal rabbit F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (both from Dako, Denmark). Secondary incubations were done in the dark at RT for 30 min. RBCs were washed again in PBS/HSA and resuspended in 20 muL Streptavidin APC-eFluor780 (eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS/HSA (v/v: 1/300). The cells were mixed and incubated in the dark at RT for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100 muL flow buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) and analyzed on a NovoCyte Quanteon (ACEA Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of experiments were subtracted background fluorescence and expressed relative to the mean of a reference experiment as stated in the text. Background fluorescence was defined as 99.9% of the lowest MFI acquired in associated experiments (99.9% was preferred over 100% to allow use of geometrical means).'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

Antibody deficient serum (ADS) was excess material from clinical investigations of a person with antibody deficiency and the use was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 1-16-02-40-12/2007-58-0010) and the Ethics Committee in Central Denmark Region (reference number 1-10-72-127-12). Human IgG antibodies against terminal galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose were affinity isolated from a normal human IgG pool as described (32). Primary incubation of cells, human antibody deficient serum, and antibody was performed in RPMI with HSA at 1 g/L constituting total volumes of 20 muL. The tubes were placed in a 37degreesC water bath and incubated for 2 h. Nanobodies or EDTA were added as stated. Red blood cells were then washed in PBS by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 20 muL PBS containing HSA at 1 mg/mL and secondary antibody (stock solutions diluted 300-fold). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled polyclonal rabbit F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (both from Dako, Denmark). Secondary incubations were done in the dark at RT for 30 min. RBCs were washed again in PBS/HSA and resuspended in 20 muL Streptavidin APC-eFluor780 (eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS/HSA (v/v: 1/300).

Primary incubation of cells, human antibody deficient serum, and antibody was performed in RPMI with HSA at 1 g/L constituting total volumes of 20 muL. The tubes were placed in a 37degreesC water bath and incubated for 2 h. Nanobodies or EDTA were added as stated. Red blood cells were then washed in PBS by centrifugation (200 g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in 20 muL PBS containing HSA at 1 mg/mL and secondary antibody (stock solutions diluted 300-fold). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled polyclonal rabbit F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (both from Dako, Denmark).

IC50 was calculated with GraphPad by fitting the data with a variable slope model.'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nThe text may describe the procedures followed as part of the protocol or some other aspect of the work.\\nIf the text describes the protocol being used, identify which of the following steps is being described - (A) the preparation of a biological sample for imaging (such as cells, tissue, a virus, a microorganism, etc.), (B) vitrification (freezing) of the sample, (C) milling the sample using a focussed ion beam (FIB) to create a used to prepare a thin, electron-transparent lamella.

Prior to transfection, HEK 293F cells were split to 0.5 x 106 cells/mL in serum-free FreeStyle 293 medium (Gibco) and incubated ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 with shaking. The following day, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium to give 2 x 106 cells/mL. The cells were incubated for 1 h with shaking and transfected using 1 mug DNA (gC1q in pcDNA3.1) per 1 mL final culture volume and a 2:1(w:w) ratio of polyethylenimine (25 kDa; Polysciences) to DNA. After 4 h, the cells were diluted to 106 cells/mL in FreeStyle 293 medium and incubated ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 with shaking. The next day, 0.25 x 106 viable cells from each of the transfected cell cultures were transferred to 6-well plates containing FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated statically ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 to allow the cells to adhere. Selection pressure was applied by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS and 200-300 mug/mL Geneticin (Gibco). The medium was changed every 2-3 days to remove dying cells and selection pressure was maintained for 11-18 days until foci could be identified. Single colonies were picked to a 24-well plate and left to proliferate in FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with FBS and Geneticin, before being transferred to 6-well plates and adapted to 0.1% FBS. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 10 mL FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with 250 mug/mL Geneticin and transferred into 125 mL flasks. The cells were cultured as recommended by the manufacturer until a cell viability of >90% was achieved. A western blot was performed on 20 muL media to identify clones with high gC1q expression. The western blot was performed using THETM His-Tag Antibody, (Genscript) (diluted 1:3,000 in low fat milk) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (diluted 1:15,000 in PBS-T).

The best clone yielded ~2-4 mg protein/L culture.\\nFor large-scale expression, gC1q expressing cells were grown in FreeStyle 293 media for 7 days at 37degreesC, 150 rpm and 8 % CO2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and gC1q was purified from culture media adjusted to pH 8.0 using a 5 mL Histrap excel column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed to baseline with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM Imidazole pH 8.0. The protein was eluted with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 400 mM Imidazole pH 8.0 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Prior to transfection, HEK 293F cells were split to 0.5 x 106 cells/mL in serum-free FreeStyle 293 medium (Gibco) and incubated ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 with shaking. The following day, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium to give 2 x 106 cells/mL. The cells were incubated for 1 h with shaking and transfected using 1 mug DNA (gC1q in pcDNA3.1) per 1 mL final culture volume and a 2:1(w:w) ratio of polyethylenimine (25 kDa; Polysciences) to DNA. After 4 h, the cells were diluted to 106 cells/mL in FreeStyle 293 medium and incubated ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 with shaking. The next day, 0.25 x 106 viable cells from each of the transfected cell cultures were transferred to 6-well plates containing FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated statically ON at 37degreesC at 8% CO2 to allow the cells to adhere. Selection pressure was applied by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS and 200-300 mug/mL Geneticin (Gibco). The medium was changed every 2-3 days to remove dying cells and selection pressure was maintained for 11-18 days until foci could be identified. Single colonies were picked to a 24-well plate and left to proliferate in FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with FBS and Geneticin, before being transferred to 6-well plates and adapted to 0.1% FBS. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 10 mL FreeStyle 293 medium supplemented with 250 mug/mL Geneticin and transferred into 125 mL flasks. The cells were cultured as recommended by the manufacturer until a cell viability of >90% was achieved. A western blot was performed on 20 muL media to identify clones with high gC1q expression. The western blot was performed using THETM His-Tag Antibody, (Genscript) (diluted 1:3,000 in low fat milk) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (diluted 1:15,000 in PBS-T). Four clones with high gC1q expression were selected and used for small scale expression and pulldown experiment using Ni Excel beads (GE healthcare). The best clone yielded ~2-4 mg protein/L culture.\\nFor large-scale expression, gC1q expressing cells were grown in FreeStyle 293 media for 7 days at 37degreesC, 150 rpm and 8 % CO2.

Diffraction data from a single crystal were processed with XDS (70). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (71) taking advantage of the single chain gC1q structure (PDB ID: 5HKJ) and a nanobody (PDB ID: 5NLW) as search models. In an iterative manner, the structure was rebuilt in COOT (72) and refined using phenix.refine (73).'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not extract any other metadata.\\n[What was the pixel spacing the CryoET step?]\\nRecord the term 'cryoet_pixel_spacing' in the 'metadata_name' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with three fields 'metadata_name', 'metadata_value' and 'orginal_text'. Do not provide additional explanation or context for the answer.\\nIf the metadata is not present in the text, record a value of 'not present' in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not include any other response other than a JSON object.\\nFinally, if you found the metadata in the text, record the original text of the sentence where the metadata specification was extracted from in the 'original_text' field of the output.\\nIf you did not find the specified metadata in the text, record 'not present' in the 'original_text' field of the output.\\nRemember, only generate JSON formatted output without any additional text or explanation.\\n                [/INST]</s>\"\n",

Diffraction data from a single crystal were processed with XDS (70). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (71) taking advantage of the single chain gC1q structure (PDB ID: 5HKJ) and a nanobody (PDB ID: 5NLW) as search models. In an iterative manner, the structure was rebuilt in COOT (72) and refined using phenix.refine (73).'''\\nThe text is taken from a scientific paper that uses Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) to to study the microscopic structure of a biological sample.\\nExtract the metadata from the section text based only on the specification delineated by square brackets and record the answer in the 'metadata_value' field of the output. Do not extract any other metadata.\\n[Which, if any, of the following electron microscopy methods were used:- (A) an energy filter, (B) a phase plate, or (C) an image corrector?]\\nRecord the term 'microscope_setup' in the 'metadata_name' field of the output.\\nGenerate only JSON formatted output with three fields 'metadata_name', 'metadata_value' and 'orginal_text'. Do not provide additional explanation or context for the answer.\\nIf the metadata is not present in the text, record a value of 'not present' in the 'metadata_value' field of the output.

The Fc hexamer was derived from the crystal packing of PDB entry 1HZH (74). Next, the 6FCZ entry containing the gC1q and the IgG-Fc was superimposed on each Fc in the 1HZH hexamer. For construction of the hexameric IgM-C1 model, the 6FCZ hexamer was manually docked into EMDB-4878 density. The gC1q's were translated outwards to fit the density without rotation, implying that the gC1q's arrangement is wider in the IgM bound C1 complex (17). To model the two paired Cmu3 domains, the corresponding Cepsilon3 dimer from the structure of IgE Fc [PDB entry 2WQR, (75)] was docked into the density. The model was completed by placing at each docked IgE Cepsilon3 domain an omalizumab Fab from PDB entry 2XA8 (76). The structure of MASP-2 CCP1-CCP2-SP domains in complex with C4b (PDB: 4FXG) was placed inside the density and the C345c domain was separated from the rest of C4b in order to improve the fitting while maintaining the contacts with MASP-2. Next, the MASP-2 domains were replaced by C1s (PDB: 5UBM) (77) and C1r CCP1-CCP2-SP domains (PDB: 2QY0) were fitted in the corresponding density (78). The tetramer formed by the C1r and C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains (PDB: 6F1C) (79) was fitted in the core by separating the two heterodimers and applying a translation, while the C1s CUB2 domain was released from the structure and fitted separately into the density. The C1q collagen stems generated as in (35) but with one additional interruption in the collagen fold at residues A88, B93, C92, were subsequently added in the density. A list of the PDB files used is provided in Table S2.\",\n",

The Fc hexamer was derived from the crystal packing of PDB entry 1HZH (74). Next, the 6FCZ entry containing the gC1q and the IgG-Fc was superimposed on each Fc in the 1HZH hexamer. For construction of the hexameric IgM-C1 model, the 6FCZ hexamer was manually docked into EMDB-4878 density. The gC1q's were translated outwards to fit the density without rotation, implying that the gC1q's arrangement is wider in the IgM bound C1 complex (17). To model the two paired Cmu3 domains, the corresponding Cepsilon3 dimer from the structure of IgE Fc [PDB entry 2WQR, (75)] was docked into the density. The model was completed by placing at each docked IgE Cepsilon3 domain an omalizumab Fab from PDB entry 2XA8 (76). The structure of MASP-2 CCP1-CCP2-SP domains in complex with C4b (PDB: 4FXG) was placed inside the density and the C345c domain was separated from the rest of C4b in order to improve the fitting while maintaining the contacts with MASP-2. Next, the MASP-2 domains were replaced by C1s (PDB: 5UBM) (77) and C1r CCP1-CCP2-SP domains (PDB: 2QY0) were fitted in the corresponding density (78). The tetramer formed by the C1r and C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains (PDB: 6F1C) (79) was fitted in the core by separating the two heterodimers and applying a translation, while the C1s CUB2 domain was released from the structure and fitted separately into the density. The C1q collagen stems generated as in (35) but with one additional interruption in the collagen fold at residues A88, B93, C92, were subsequently added in the density.

The Fc hexamer was derived from the crystal packing of PDB entry 1HZH (74). Next, the 6FCZ entry containing the gC1q and the IgG-Fc was superimposed on each Fc in the 1HZH hexamer. For construction of the hexameric IgM-C1 model, the 6FCZ hexamer was manually docked into EMDB-4878 density. The gC1q's were translated outwards to fit the density without rotation, implying that the gC1q's arrangement is wider in the IgM bound C1 complex (17). To model the two paired Cmu3 domains, the corresponding Cepsilon3 dimer from the structure of IgE Fc [PDB entry 2WQR, (75)] was docked into the density. The model was completed by placing at each docked IgE Cepsilon3 domain an omalizumab Fab from PDB entry 2XA8 (76). The structure of MASP-2 CCP1-CCP2-SP domains in complex with C4b (PDB: 4FXG) was placed inside the density and the C345c domain was separated from the rest of C4b in order to improve the fitting while maintaining the contacts with MASP-2. Next, the MASP-2 domains were replaced by C1s (PDB: 5UBM) (77) and C1r CCP1-CCP2-SP domains (PDB: 2QY0) were fitted in the corresponding density (78). The tetramer formed by the C1r and C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains (PDB: 6F1C) (79) was fitted in the core by separating the two heterodimers and applying a translation, while the C1s CUB2 domain was released from the structure and fitted separately into the density.

The Fc hexamer was derived from the crystal packing of PDB entry 1HZH (74). Next, the 6FCZ entry containing the gC1q and the IgG-Fc was superimposed on each Fc in the 1HZH hexamer. For construction of the hexameric IgM-C1 model, the 6FCZ hexamer was manually docked into EMDB-4878 density. The gC1q's were translated outwards to fit the density without rotation, implying that the gC1q's arrangement is wider in the IgM bound C1 complex (17). To model the two paired Cmu3 domains, the corresponding Cepsilon3 dimer from the structure of IgE Fc [PDB entry 2WQR, (75)] was docked into the density. The model was completed by placing at each docked IgE Cepsilon3 domain an omalizumab Fab from PDB entry 2XA8 (76). The structure of MASP-2 CCP1-CCP2-SP domains in complex with C4b (PDB: 4FXG) was placed inside the density and the C345c domain was separated from the rest of C4b in order to improve the fitting while maintaining the contacts with MASP-2. Next, the MASP-2 domains were replaced by C1s (PDB: 5UBM) (77) and C1r CCP1-CCP2-SP domains (PDB: 2QY0) were fitted in the corresponding density (78). The tetramer formed by the C1r and C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains (PDB: 6F1C) (79) was fitted in the core by separating the two heterodimers and applying a translation, while the C1s CUB2 domain was released from the structure and fitted separately into the density. The C1q collagen stems generated as in (35) but with one additional interruption in the collagen fold at residues A88, B93, C92, were subsequently added in the density.

The Fc hexamer was derived from the crystal packing of PDB entry 1HZH (74). Next, the 6FCZ entry containing the gC1q and the IgG-Fc was superimposed on each Fc in the 1HZH hexamer. For construction of the hexameric IgM-C1 model, the 6FCZ hexamer was manually docked into EMDB-4878 density. The gC1q's were translated outwards to fit the density without rotation, implying that the gC1q's arrangement is wider in the IgM bound C1 complex (17). To model the two paired Cmu3 domains, the corresponding Cepsilon3 dimer from the structure of IgE Fc [PDB entry 2WQR, (75)] was docked into the density. The model was completed by placing at each docked IgE Cepsilon3 domain an omalizumab Fab from PDB entry 2XA8 (76). The structure of MASP-2 CCP1-CCP2-SP domains in complex with C4b (PDB: 4FXG) was placed inside the density and the C345c domain was separated from the rest of C4b in order to improve the fitting while maintaining the contacts with MASP-2. Next, the MASP-2 domains were replaced by C1s (PDB: 5UBM) (77) and C1r CCP1-CCP2-SP domains (PDB: 2QY0) were fitted in the corresponding density (78). The tetramer formed by the C1r and C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains (PDB: 6F1C) (79) was fitted in the core by separating the two heterodimers and applying a translation, while the C1s CUB2 domain was released from the structure and fitted separately into the density.

      "Cryo-electron tomograms capture a wealth of structural information on the molecular constituents of cells and tissues. We present DeePiCt (deep picker in context), an open-source deep-learning framework for supervised segmentation and macromolecular complex localization in cryo-electron tomography. To train and benchmark DeePiCt on experimental data, we comprehensively annotated 20 tomograms of Schizosaccharomyces pombe for ribosomes, fatty acid synthases, membranes, nuclear pore complexes, organelles, and cytosol. By comparing DeePiCt to state-of-the-art approaches on this dataset, we show its unique ability to identify low-abundance and low-density complexes. We use DeePiCt to study compositionally distinct subpopulations of cellular ribosomes, with emphasis on their contextual association with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, applying pre-trained networks to a HeLa cell tomogram demonstrates that DeePiCt achieves high-quality predictions in unseen datasets from different biological species in a matter of minutes. The comprehensively annotated experimental data and pre-trained networks are provided for immediate use by the community.,format=None,name=None,id=86f140465a,type=CitationRecord,)]\n"
