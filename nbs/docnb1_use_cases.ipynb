We __fund__ scientific research worldwide to advance the frontiers of knowledge. And we launched a family of institutes to __do__ research that canâ€™t be done in conventional environments. Each aspect is essential to our approach to building for the long term. \n",
    "\n",
    "We describe this coordinated activity as '__Build__ / __Fund__ / __Do__', so that our SciTech development work (the '__Build__' compontent), is based on scientific challenges and use cases provided by the collaborative research networks that funding supports and direct research activities undertaken within the CZI research organizations (CZI BioHubs in the Bay Area, Chicago, and New York; the Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute, etc.).  \n",

    "1. Zero-shot information extraction of metadata from the methods sections of full text papers describing CryoET papers in order to support curation of that data into the [CZI CryoET Portal](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cryoet-data-portal/) system - see below.   \n",
    "2. Understanding distribution of types of experimental studies in rare disease research (see [Human Annotated Corpus for Disease Research State Classifications](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/DRSM-corpus))\n",

    "A key use case for this effort is the development of tools that can assist curation of complex datasets to a central repository (such as for the Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute's [CryoET Data Portal](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cryoet-data-portal/). Our preliminary implementation uses hand-coded prompts that are specifically tailored for standard CryoET protocol elements and uses [the Mixtral 'mixture of experts' large language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088) to extract metadata for 20 questions at a time from NXML- or PDF-based full text papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We currently seek to improve this use case by including ontology search / matching capabilities to the extracted text and to generalize the extraction process to other protocol types. \n"
