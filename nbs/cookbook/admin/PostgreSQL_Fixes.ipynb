Consequently, mechanistic insights into the membrane remodeling mechanism have remained sparse.\",\n",

The oligomerized EHD4 structure resembles the closed conformation, where the tips of the helical domains protrude into the membrane. The variation in filament geometry and tube radius suggests a spontaneous filament curvature of approximately 1/70 nm<sup>-1</sup>. Combining the available structural and functional data, we suggest a model for EHD-mediated membrane remodeling.\"\n",
