Together, resident ER membrane proteins, cytoplasmic translation factors, and both integral membrane and cytosolic RNA-binding proteins operate in concert with membrane-associated ribosomes to facilitate ER-localized translation. Little is known, however, regarding the spatial organization of ER-localized translation. This question is of growing significance as it is now known that ER-bound ribosomes contribute to secretory, integral membrane, and cytosolic protein synthesis alike. To explore this question, we utilized quantitative proximity proteomics to identify neighboring protein networks for the candidate ribosome interactors SEC61\\\\u03b2 (subunit of the protein translocase), RPN1 (oligosaccharyltransferase subunit), SEC62 (translocation integral membrane protein), and LRRC59 (ribosome binding integral membrane protein). Biotin labeling time course studies of the four BioID reporters revealed distinct labeling patterns that intensified but only modestly diversified as a function of labeling time, suggesting that the ER membrane is organized into discrete protein interaction domains. Whereas SEC61\\\\u03b2 and RPN1 reporters identified translocon-associated networks, SEC62 and LRRC59 reporters revealed divergent protein interactomes. Notably, the SEC62 interactome is enriched in redox-linked proteins and ER luminal chaperones, with the latter likely representing proximity to an ER luminal chaperone reflux pathway. In contrast, the LRRC59 interactome is highly enriched in SRP pathway components, translation factors, and ER-localized RNA-binding proteins, uncovering a functional link between LRRC59 and mRNA translation regulation. Importantly, analysis of the LRRC59 interactome by native immunoprecipitation identified similar protein and functional enrichments. Moreover, [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation assays revealed that siRNA silencing of LRRC59 expression reduced steady state translation levels on the ER by ca. 50%, and also impacted steady state translation levels in the cytosol compartment.

It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. Our work demonstrates that ER stress could play a central role in ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis.

In recent years, these ubiquitous membrane structures have emerged as central signaling hubs that control a multitude of cellular pathways, ranging from lipid metabolism/transport to the exchange of metabolites and ions (i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup> ), and general organellar biogenesis. The functional crosstalk between juxtaposed membranes at MCSs relies on a defined composite of proteins and lipids that populate these microdomains in a dynamic fashion. This is particularly important in the nervous system, where alterations in the composition of MCSs have been shown to affect their functions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focus on the MCSs that are formed by the tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria, the ER to the endo-lysosomes and the mitochondria to the lysosomes. We highlight how glycosphingolipids that are aberrantly processed/degraded and accumulate ectopically in intracellular membranes and the PM change the topology of MCSs, disrupting signaling pathways that lead to neuronal demise and neurodegeneration.

In recent years, nuclear EGFR has been implicated in regulating gene transcription, cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. Different models have been proposed to explain how the receptors are transported into the nucleus. However, a clear consensus has yet to be reached. Recently, we described the nuclear envelope associated endosomes (NAE) pathway, which delivers EGFR from the cell surface to the nucleus. This pathway involves transport, docking and fusion of NAEs with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. EGFR is then presumed to be transported through the nuclear pore complex, extracted from membranes and solubilised. The SUN1/2 nuclear envelope proteins, Importin-beta, nuclear pore complex proteins and the Sec61 translocon have been implicated in the process.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress. The translation of some mRNAs occurs in specialized \\\\\\\"translation factories,\\\\\\\" assemblysomes, transperons and other structures necessary for the correct folding of proteins, interaction with functional partners and formation of oligomeric complexes. Intracellular localization of mRNA has a significant impact on the efficiency of its translation and presumably determines its response to cellular stress. Compartmentalization of mRNAs and the translation machinery also plays an important role in viral infections. Many viruses provoke the formation of specific intracellular structures, virus factories, for the production of their proteins. Here we review the current concepts of the molecular mechanisms of transport, selective localization and local translation of cellular and viral mRNAs, their effects on protein targeting and topogenesis, and on the regulation of protein biosynthesis in different compartments of the eukaryotic cell.

Together, resident ER membrane proteins, cytoplasmic translation factors, and both integral membrane and cytosolic RNA-binding proteins operate in concert with membrane-associated ribosomes to facilitate ER-localized translation. Little is known, however, regarding the spatial organization of ER-localized translation. This question is of growing significance as it is now known that ER-bound ribosomes contribute to secretory, integral membrane, and cytosolic protein synthesis alike. To explore this question, we utilized quantitative proximity proteomics to identify neighboring protein networks for the candidate ribosome interactors SEC61\\\\u03b2 (subunit of the protein translocase), RPN1 (oligosaccharyltransferase subunit), SEC62 (translocation integral membrane protein), and LRRC59 (ribosome binding integral membrane protein). Biotin labeling time course studies of the four BioID reporters revealed distinct labeling patterns that intensified but only modestly diversified as a function of labeling time, suggesting that the ER membrane is organized into discrete protein interaction domains. Whereas SEC61\\\\u03b2 and RPN1 reporters identified translocon-associated networks, SEC62 and LRRC59 reporters revealed divergent protein interactomes. Notably, the SEC62 interactome is enriched in redox-linked proteins and ER luminal chaperones, with the latter likely representing proximity to an ER luminal chaperone reflux pathway. In contrast, the LRRC59 interactome is highly enriched in SRP pathway components, translation factors, and ER-localized RNA-binding proteins, uncovering a functional link between LRRC59 and mRNA translation regulation. Importantly, analysis of the LRRC59 interactome by native immunoprecipitation identified similar protein and functional enrichments. Moreover, [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation assays revealed that siRNA silencing of LRRC59 expression reduced steady state translation levels on the ER by ca. 50%, and also impacted steady state translation levels in the cytosol compartment.

It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. Our work demonstrates that ER stress could play a central role in ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis.

In recent years, these ubiquitous membrane structures have emerged as central signaling hubs that control a multitude of cellular pathways, ranging from lipid metabolism/transport to the exchange of metabolites and ions (i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup> ), and general organellar biogenesis. The functional crosstalk between juxtaposed membranes at MCSs relies on a defined composite of proteins and lipids that populate these microdomains in a dynamic fashion. This is particularly important in the nervous system, where alterations in the composition of MCSs have been shown to affect their functions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focus on the MCSs that are formed by the tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria, the ER to the endo-lysosomes and the mitochondria to the lysosomes. We highlight how glycosphingolipids that are aberrantly processed/degraded and accumulate ectopically in intracellular membranes and the PM change the topology of MCSs, disrupting signaling pathways that lead to neuronal demise and neurodegeneration.

Elevated levels of nuclear EGFR correlate with poor prognosis in various cancers. In recent years, nuclear EGFR has been implicated in regulating gene transcription, cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. Different models have been proposed to explain how the receptors are transported into the nucleus. However, a clear consensus has yet to be reached. Recently, we described the nuclear envelope associated endosomes (NAE) pathway, which delivers EGFR from the cell surface to the nucleus. This pathway involves transport, docking and fusion of NAEs with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. EGFR is then presumed to be transported through the nuclear pore complex, extracted from membranes and solubilised. The SUN1/2 nuclear envelope proteins, Importin-beta, nuclear pore complex proteins and the Sec61 translocon have been implicated in the process. While this framework can explain the cell surface to nucleus traffic of EGFR and other cell surface receptors, it raises several questions that we consider in this review, together with implications for health and disease.\\\", \\\"DOI\\\": \\\"doi:10.3390/cells8080915\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Shah P, Chaumet A, Royle SJ, Bard FA.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress. The translation of some mRNAs occurs in specialized \\\\\\\"translation factories,\\\\\\\" assemblysomes, transperons and other structures necessary for the correct folding of proteins, interaction with functional partners and formation of oligomeric complexes. Intracellular localization of mRNA has a significant impact on the efficiency of its translation and presumably determines its response to cellular stress. Compartmentalization of mRNAs and the translation machinery also plays an important role in viral infections. Many viruses provoke the formation of specific intracellular structures, virus factories, for the production of their proteins. Here we review the current concepts of the molecular mechanisms of transport, selective localization and local translation of cellular and viral mRNAs, their effects on protein targeting and topogenesis, and on the regulation of protein biosynthesis in different compartments of the eukaryotic cell.

NEDDylated protein\\\\u00a0levels in normal and cystic human cholangiocytes were assessed by immunoprecipitation, and the proteomic profile was further analyzed by mass spectrometry.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>The genes involved in the NEDDylation pathway were found overexpressed (mRNA) in polycystic human and rat liver tissue, as well as in cystic cholangiocytes in culture, compared to controls.

Pevonedistat promoted apoptotic cell death and reduced proliferation in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro. Comparative proteomic profiling of NEDD8-immunoprecipitated proteins between normal and cystic cholangiocytes in culture reported candidate proteins involved in cystogenesis, mostly associated with protein biogenesis and quality control.

Together, resident ER membrane proteins, cytoplasmic translation factors, and both integral membrane and cytosolic RNA-binding proteins operate in concert with membrane-associated ribosomes to facilitate ER-localized translation. Little is known, however, regarding the spatial organization of ER-localized translation. This question is of growing significance as it is now known that ER-bound ribosomes contribute to secretory, integral membrane, and cytosolic protein synthesis alike. To explore this question, we utilized quantitative proximity proteomics to identify neighboring protein networks for the candidate ribosome interactors SEC61\\\\u03b2 (subunit of the protein translocase), RPN1 (oligosaccharyltransferase subunit), SEC62 (translocation integral membrane protein), and LRRC59 (ribosome binding integral membrane protein). Biotin labeling time course studies of the four BioID reporters revealed distinct labeling patterns that intensified but only modestly diversified as a function of labeling time, suggesting that the ER membrane is organized into discrete protein interaction domains. Whereas SEC61\\\\u03b2 and RPN1 reporters identified translocon-associated networks, SEC62 and LRRC59 reporters revealed divergent protein interactomes. Notably, the SEC62 interactome is enriched in redox-linked proteins and ER luminal chaperones, with the latter likely representing proximity to an ER luminal chaperone reflux pathway. In contrast, the LRRC59 interactome is highly enriched in SRP pathway components, translation factors, and ER-localized RNA-binding proteins, uncovering a functional link between LRRC59 and mRNA translation regulation. Importantly, analysis of the LRRC59 interactome by native immunoprecipitation identified similar protein and functional enrichments. Moreover, [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation assays revealed that siRNA silencing of LRRC59 expression reduced steady state translation levels on the ER by ca. 50%, and also impacted steady state translation levels in the cytosol compartment. Collectively, these data reveal a functional domain organization for the ER and identify a key role for LRRC59 in the organization and regulation of local translation.\\\", \\\"DOI\\\": \\\"doi:10.1074/mcp.ra120.002228\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Hannigan MM, Hoffman AM, Thompson JW, Zheng T, Nicchitta CV.

It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. Our work demonstrates that ER stress could play a central role in ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis. This sets the bases for future work to develop novel therapeutic strategies through modulation of ER homeostasis and associated protein degradation pathways.\\\", \\\"DOI\\\": \\\"doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175970\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Schaeffer C, Merella S, Pasqualetto E, Lazarevic D, Rampoldi L.

In recent years, these ubiquitous membrane structures have emerged as central signaling hubs that control a multitude of cellular pathways, ranging from lipid metabolism/transport to the exchange of metabolites and ions (i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup> ), and general organellar biogenesis. The functional crosstalk between juxtaposed membranes at MCSs relies on a defined composite of proteins and lipids that populate these microdomains in a dynamic fashion. This is particularly important in the nervous system, where alterations in the composition of MCSs have been shown to affect their functions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focus on the MCSs that are formed by the tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria, the ER to the endo-lysosomes and the mitochondria to the lysosomes. We highlight how glycosphingolipids that are aberrantly processed/degraded and accumulate ectopically in intracellular membranes and the PM change the topology of MCSs, disrupting signaling pathways that lead to neuronal demise and neurodegeneration.

Elevated levels of nuclear EGFR correlate with poor prognosis in various cancers. In recent years, nuclear EGFR has been implicated in regulating gene transcription, cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. Different models have been proposed to explain how the receptors are transported into the nucleus. However, a clear consensus has yet to be reached. Recently, we described the nuclear envelope associated endosomes (NAE) pathway, which delivers EGFR from the cell surface to the nucleus. This pathway involves transport, docking and fusion of NAEs with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. EGFR is then presumed to be transported through the nuclear pore complex, extracted from membranes and solubilised. The SUN1/2 nuclear envelope proteins, Importin-beta, nuclear pore complex proteins and the Sec61 translocon have been implicated in the process. While this framework can explain the cell surface to nucleus traffic of EGFR and other cell surface receptors, it raises several questions that we consider in this review, together with implications for health and disease.\\\", \\\"DOI\\\": \\\"doi:10.3390/cells8080915\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Shah P, Chaumet A, Royle SJ, Bard FA.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress. The translation of some mRNAs occurs in specialized \\\\\\\"translation factories,\\\\\\\" assemblysomes, transperons and other structures necessary for the correct folding of proteins, interaction with functional partners and formation of oligomeric complexes. Intracellular localization of mRNA has a significant impact on the efficiency of its translation and presumably determines its response to cellular stress. Compartmentalization of mRNAs and the translation machinery also plays an important role in viral infections. Many viruses provoke the formation of specific intracellular structures, virus factories, for the production of their proteins. Here we review the current concepts of the molecular mechanisms of transport, selective localization and local translation of cellular and viral mRNAs, their effects on protein targeting and topogenesis, and on the regulation of protein biosynthesis in different compartments of the eukaryotic cell.

Here, it controls targeting to mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs), thus influencing composition of the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). Moreover, Rab32 regulates mitochondrial membrane dynamics via its effector dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Rab32 has also been reported to induce autophagy, an essential pathway targeting intracellular components for their degradation. However, no autophagy-specific effectors have been identified for Rab32. Similarly, the identity of the intracellular membrane targeted by this small GTPase and the type of autophagy it induces are not known yet.<h4>Results</h4>To investigate the target of autophagic degradation mediated by Rab32, we tested a large panel of organellar proteins. We found that a subset of MERC proteins, including the thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein TMX1, are specifically targeted for degradation in a Rab32-dependent manner. We also identified the long isoform of reticulon-3 (RTN3L), a known ER-phagy receptor, as a Rab32 effector.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rab32 promotes degradation of mitochondrial-proximal ER membranes through autophagy with the help of RTN3L.

Previous studies revealed that cystic cholangiocytes are characterized by endoplasmic reticulum stress and aberrant posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins, in particular hyper-SUMOylation, that promote PLD pathobiology. Protein NEDDylation is a newly characterized PTM that modulates a plethora of biological processes and its dysregulation is associated with the development and progression of several human diseases. However, the role of NEDDylation in PLD remains elusive.<h4>Objective</h4>To explore the role of protein NEDDylation in PLD and its potential therapeutic regulatory value.<h4>Methods</h4>Levels and functional effects of NEDDylation, including response to Pevonedistat (first-in-class selective inhibitor of the NEDDylation E1 enzyme NAE), were assessed in vitro, in vivo, and/or in patients with PLD. NEDDylated protein\\\\u00a0levels in normal and cystic human cholangiocytes were assessed by immunoprecipitation, and the proteomic profile was further analyzed by mass spectrometry.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>The genes involved in the NEDDylation pathway were found overexpressed (mRNA) in polycystic human and rat liver tissue, as well as in cystic cholangiocytes in culture, compared to controls. Elevated levels of NEDDylated proteins were further confirmed in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro, which diminished under Pevonedistat incubation. Pevonedistat promoted apoptotic cell death and reduced proliferation in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro. Comparative proteomic profiling of NEDD8-immunoprecipitated proteins between normal and cystic cholangiocytes in culture reported candidate proteins involved in cystogenesis, mostly associated with protein biogenesis and quality control. All these data indicate that cystic cholangiocytes display increased protein NEDDylation, contributing to cell survival and proliferation, ultimately supporting hepatic cystogenesis.

This process involves targeting of the precursors to the membrane and opening of the polypeptide conducting Sec61 channel for translocation. Apart from this central role in the intracellular transport of polypeptides, several studies of the last decade uncovered additional functions of Sec proteins in intracellular signaling: Sec62 can induce ER-phagy in the process of recovery of cells from ER stress and the Sec61 channel can also act as a passive ER calcium leak channel. Furthermore, mutations, amplifications and an overexpression of the <i>SEC</i> genes were linked to various diseases including kidney and liver diseases, diabetes and human cancer. Studies of the last decade could not only elucidate the functional role of Sec proteins in the pathogenesis of these diseases, but also demonstrate a relevance of Sec62 as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in head and neck cancer, prostate and lung cancer including a basis for new therapeutic strategies. In this article, we review the current understanding of protein transport across the ER membrane as central function of Sec proteins and further focus on recent studies that gave first insights into the functional role and therapeutic relevance of Sec61, Sec62 and Sec63 in human diseases.\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Linxweiler M, Schick B, Zimmermann R.

The primary role of the Sec61 complex is to allow protein import in the ER during translation. Surprisingly, a completely different function in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis has emerged for the Sec61 complex, and the latter is now accepted as one of the major Ca<sup>2+</sup>-leak pathways of the ER. In this review, we first discuss the structure of the Sec61 complex and focus on the pharmacology and regulation of the Sec61 complex as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-leak channel. Subsequently, we will pay particular attention to pathologies that are linked to Sec61 mutations, such as plasma cell deficiency and congenital neutropenia.

While the bacterial homolog of the Sec61 complex resides in the plasma membrane, the eukaryotic counterpart manages the transfer of precursor proteins into or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Sec61 complexes are accompanied by a set of dynamically recruited auxiliary proteins assisting the transport of certain precursor polypeptides. TRAP and Sec62/Sec63 are two auxiliary protein complexes in mammalian cells that have been characterized by structural and biochemical methods. Using these ER membrane protein complexes for our proof-of-concept study, we aimed to detect interactions of membrane proteins in living mammalian cells under physiological conditions. Bimolecular luminescence complementation and competition was used to demonstrate multiple protein-protein interactions of different topological layouts. In addition to the interaction of the soluble catalytic and regulatory subunits of the cytosolic protein kinase A, we detected interactions of ER membrane proteins that either belong to the same multimeric protein complex (intra-complex interactions: Sec61\\\\u03b1-Sec61\\\\u03b2, TRAP\\\\u03b1-TRAP\\\\u03b2) or protein complexes in juxtaposition (inter-complex interactions: Sec61\\\\u03b1-TRAP\\\\u03b1, Sec61\\\\u03b1-Sec63, and Sec61\\\\u03b2-Sec63). In the process, we established further control elements like synthetic peptide complementation for expression profiling of fusion constructs and protease-mediated reporter degradation demonstrating the cytosolic localization of a reporter complementation.

It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation.

It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. Our work demonstrates that ER stress could play a central role in ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress.

Elevated levels of nuclear EGFR correlate with poor prognosis in various cancers. In recent years, nuclear EGFR has been implicated in regulating gene transcription, cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. Different models have been proposed to explain how the receptors are transported into the nucleus. However, a clear consensus has yet to be reached. Recently, we described the nuclear envelope associated endosomes (NAE) pathway, which delivers EGFR from the cell surface to the nucleus. This pathway involves transport, docking and fusion of NAEs with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. EGFR is then presumed to be transported through the nuclear pore complex, extracted from membranes and solubilised. The SUN1/2 nuclear envelope proteins, Importin-beta, nuclear pore complex proteins and the Sec61 translocon have been implicated in the process. While this framework can explain the cell surface to nucleus traffic of EGFR and other cell surface receptors, it raises several questions that we consider in this review, together with implications for health and disease.\\\", \\\"CITATION\\\": \\\"Shah P, Chaumet A, Royle SJ, Bard FA.

According to the classical view, mRNA transcripts encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins are translated by ribosomes associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while soluble cytoplasmic proteins are synthesized on free polysomes. However, in the last few years, new data has emerged, revealing selective translation of mRNA on mitochondria and plastids, in proximity to peroxisomes and endosomes, in various granules and at the cytoskeleton (actin network, vimentin intermediate filaments, microtubules and centrosomes). There are also long-standing debates about the possibility of protein synthesis in the nucleus. Localized translation can be determined by targeting signals in the synthesized protein, nucleotide sequences in the mRNA itself, or both. With RNA-binding proteins, many transcripts can be assembled into specific RNA condensates and form RNP particles, which may be transported by molecular motors to the sites of active translation, form granules and provoke liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm, both under normal conditions and during cell stress. The translation of some mRNAs occurs in specialized \\\\\\\"translation factories,\\\\\\\" assemblysomes, transperons and other structures necessary for the correct folding of proteins, interaction with functional partners and formation of oligomeric complexes. Intracellular localization of mRNA has a significant impact on the efficiency of its translation and presumably determines its response to cellular stress. Compartmentalization of mRNAs and the translation machinery also plays an important role in viral infections. Many viruses provoke the formation of specific intracellular structures, virus factories, for the production of their proteins. Here we review the current concepts of the molecular mechanisms of transport, selective localization and local translation of cellular and viral mRNAs, their effects on protein targeting and topogenesis, and on the regulation of protein biosynthesis in different compartments of the eukaryotic cell.

NEDDylated protein\\\\u00a0levels in normal and cystic human cholangiocytes were assessed by immunoprecipitation, and the proteomic profile was further analyzed by mass spectrometry.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>The genes involved in the NEDDylation pathway were found overexpressed (mRNA) in polycystic human and rat liver tissue, as well as in cystic cholangiocytes in culture, compared to controls. Elevated levels of NEDDylated proteins were further confirmed in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro, which diminished under Pevonedistat incubation. Pevonedistat promoted apoptotic cell death and reduced proliferation in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro. Comparative proteomic profiling of NEDD8-immunoprecipitated proteins between normal and cystic cholangiocytes in culture reported candidate proteins involved in cystogenesis, mostly associated with protein biogenesis and quality control. All these data indicate that cystic cholangiocytes display increased protein NEDDylation, contributing to cell survival and proliferation, ultimately supporting hepatic cystogenesis.
