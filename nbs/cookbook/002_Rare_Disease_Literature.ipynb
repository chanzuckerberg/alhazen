SPS is most associated with GAD65 and GlyRalpha1 antibodies. Although underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, it has been hypothesized that anti-GAD65 antibodies have an inhibitory effect on GAD65, blocking gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and thus reducing the uptake of GABA in synaptic vesicles and synaptic release.<<REF:Dade-2020-21-3701>><<REF:Hansen-2013-239-202>><<REF:Mitoma-2016-15-213>> The decreased synthesis of GABA will result in decreased GABAergic transmission and lead to a state of neuronal hyperexcitability.<<REF:Dade-2020-21-3701>> However, it is hypothesized that GlyRalpha1 binds directly to motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem leading to motor neuron hyperactivity.<<REF:Carvajal-González-2014-137-2178>> This proposed pathophysiology was further demonstrated by patient GlyR-IgG disrupting inhibitory neurotransmission in cultured rodent motor neurons showing direct antagonistic actions on the glycine receptor.<<REF:Crisp-2019-142-3398>> However, the exact pathologic role of anti-GAD and anti-GlyRalpha1 in humans is unknown, and different associated antibodies likely reflect different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. An immune-mediated mechanism is further supported by patient response to immunomodulatory therapy, including IV immunoglobulin (IVIg), plasma exchange (PLEX), and/or rituximab. It has also been suggested that GlyRalpha1-positive SPS may be more immunotherapy-responsive compared with patients with GAD65-positive SPS.<<REF:Hinson-2018-5-e438>> Longer-term prospective studies following patients with GlyRalpha1-positive SPS demonstrating sustained improvement are lacking compared with those cohorts studied in GAD65.<<REF:Rakocevic-2019-19-1>> One series of 17 patients with GlyRalpha1-positive SPS demonstrated that some patients responded well to immunotherapy initially, but many had a more progressive, immunotherapy-refractory course with extended follow-up.<<REF:Piquet-2019-6-e592>> More recently, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) has been shown to have benefit in anti-GAD65-positive SPS.<<REF:Kass-Iliyya-2021-268-265>><<REF:Burt-2021-96-e817>><<REF:Sanders-2014-71-1296>> We report a case of GlyR antibody-positive SPS successfully treated with aHSCT.', metadata={'c_ids': '81', 'e_id': 'doi:10.1212/nxi.0000000000200197', 'e_type': 'ScientificPrimaryResearchArticle', 'i_id': '5698be5f7c', 'i_type': 'JATSFullText', 'f_id': '5698be5f7c.1', 'citation': 'Celli SI, Nash R, Money KM, Garza M, Borko TL, Mizenko C, McMenamin C, Von Geldern G, Georges G, Piquet AL.

The pathological mechanism of autoantibodies in stiff-person syndrome remains unclear, but there is evidence that points to blockade of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production.<<REF:Dalakas-2000-55-1531>> Glutamic acid decarboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamic acid into the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.

Therefore, titer monitoring is unnecessary.<<REF:Silva-2010-5-55>> The authors report a case of stiff-person syndrome associated with symptomatic thyrotropin receptor antibody-positive Graves' disease at diagnosis in a child.

Here, we report the case of a 69-year-old man with a rare mandibular involuntary movement and amphiphysin antibodies-associated SPS to deepen the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder, and expand the pool of known clinical manifestations of SPS.', metadata={'c_ids': '81', 'e_id': 'doi:10.1097/md.0000000000024312', 'e_type': 'ScientificPrimaryResearchArticle', 'i_id': '3c381793a5', 'i_type': 'JATSFullText', 'f_id': '3c381793a5.0', 'citation': 'Xie YY, Meng HM, Zhang FX, Maimaiti B, Jiang T, Yang Y.

       " (Document(page_content=\"Discussion\\nHere we reported a case centered on a 46-year-old female with a past medical history of Type 1 diabetes and focal seizures with impaired awareness, who presented with symptoms consistent with stiff person syndrome (SPS), and anti-GAD65 titers superseding maximum levels detected by laboratory measurements. This case highlights the increasing significance of autoimmune etiologies in neurological syndromes such as SPS. What makes this case unique is the onset and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at an older age as well as the markedly elevated titers of anti-GAD65. Further, the patient's history of focal seizures with impaired awareness contributes to the growing body of literature that connects anti-GAD65 to a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.\\nStiff person syndrome and anti-GAD65 \\nThe diagnosis of stiff person syndrome, formally introduced in 1956, comprises a broad range of symptoms [<<REF:Dalakas-2022-19-832>>]. However, the classic clinical features include painful episodic spasms that can arise spontaneously or are associated with triggers such as loud sounds, and proximal muscle rigidity. Mechanistically, the stiffness is thought to be the combined effect of simultaneously activating agonist and antagonist muscles [<<REF:Dalakas-2022-19-832>>,<<REF:Martinez-Hernandez-2016-73-714>>,<<REF:Ortiz-2020-12-0>>]. This can ultimately result in postural instability, falls, and issues with ambulation, as seen in our patient [<<REF:Ortiz-2020-12-0>>]. With regard to etiology, it has been purported that SPS is due to decreased GABAergic neurotransmission and subsequent neuronal excitation [<<REF:Muranova-2023-?-?>>]. This is supported by a strong association with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 dm and vitiligo, and high antibody titers of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (Anti-GAD65), an antibody against the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis [<<REF:Martinez-Hernandez-2016-73-714>>,<<REF:Muranova-2023-?-?>>,<<REF:Burton-2010-184-4863>>]. \\nStudies analyzing the association between Anti-GAD65 levels and clinical diagnosis and presentation reveal interesting findings. It has been purported that higher titers of anti-GAD65 can be used as a diagnostic proxy with some studies even suggesting it be pathognomonic for syndromes such as SPS [<<REF:Muñoz-Lopetegi-2020-7-?>>,<<REF:Burton-2010-184-4863>>,<<REF:Newsome-2022-369-577915>>]. Despite this certainty, higher titers are not associated with clinical severity and overall course [<<REF:Rakocevic-2019-19-1>>]. However, establishing an anti-GAD65 threshold for diagnosis remains crucial, especially in cases such as our patient's. Despite our patient presenting with classical clinical symptoms and DM1, our patient's electromyogram (EMG)findings were unremarkable with no evidence of abnormal motor units. This poses a diagnostic challenge as there is no objective laboratory finding except for the presence of extremely elevated titers of anti-GAD65. According to some, the combination of anti-GAD65 and clinical presentation alone may be sufficient to diagnose SPS [<<REF:Newsome-2022-369-577915>>].\\nType 1 diabetes mellitus and stiff person syndrome\\nAdditionally, anti-GAD65 antibodies have been reported to be present in up to 80% of DM1 patients [<<REF:Rakocevic-2019-19-1>>]. While the epitopes for anti-GAD65 vary between SPS and DM1 patients, 30% of SPS patients have DM1 [<<REF:Muranova-2023-?-?>>]. This can further support the diagnosis of SPS if a patient presents with DM1. In addition to being a part of this overlapping group of patients, our patient also displayed the characteristic clinical course whereby DM1 diagnosis occurred prior to the onset of SPS. While DM1 typically has childhood onset before the age of 14, our patient presented with late-onset DM1, being diagnosed at the age of 28; anti-GAD65 has been interpreted to be a biomarker for DM1 [<<REF:Muñoz-Lopetegi-2020-7-?>>]. \\nAnti-GAD65 and refractory epilepsy \\nEpilepsy is one of the core neurological diseases associated with anti-GAD65 [<<REF:Dalakas-2022-19-832>>,<<REF:Burton-2010-184-4863>>,<<REF:Budhram-2021-92-645>>]. In fact, the onset of epilepsy occurs earlier than the onset of other anti-GAD65 disease associations such as SPS and cerebellar ataxia, and often presents concurrently with syndromes such as SPS [<<REF:Budhram-2021-92-645>>]. However, one study found that refractory epilepsy was more likely to be found in isolation than along with SPS [<<REF:Budhram-2021-92-645>>]. Further, another study found that epilepsy in SPS is often well controlled [<<REF:Dalakas-2022-19-832>>]. Indeed, our patient has experienced refractory epilepsy - trying different medications - prior to the diagnosis of SPS.\", metadata={'c_ids': '81', 'e_id': 'doi:10.7759/cureus.40611', 'e_type': 'ClinicalCaseReport', 'i_id': 'd8e991bd6c', 'i_type': 'JATSFullText', 'f_id': 'd8e991bd6c.2', 'citation': 'Bach KT, Ananth S, Thind I, Zhong N, Lui F.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.', metadata={'skc_ids': '81', 'ske_id': 'doi:10.1155/2015/278065', 'ski_id': 'c4ffa374ef', 'skf_id': 'c4ffa374ef.0', 'type': 'CitationRecord', 'citation': 'Buechner S, Florio I, Capone L.

Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-α1 receptor can also be observed.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J.

Since its initial description in 1956, marked progress has been made in the clinical characterisation, understanding of pathogenesis and therapy of this disorder. SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-α1 receptor can also be observed. Paraneoplastic SPS is commonly associated with antiamphiphysin antibodies and breast cancer.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J.

Since its initial description in 1956, marked progress has been made in the clinical characterisation, understanding of pathogenesis and therapy of this disorder. SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-α1 receptor can also be observed.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J.

Since its initial description in 1956, marked progress has been made in the clinical characterisation, understanding of pathogenesis and therapy of this disorder. SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-α1 receptor can also be observed.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J.

SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J.

Since its initial description in 1956, marked progress has been made in the clinical characterisation, understanding of pathogenesis and therapy of this disorder. SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-α1 receptor can also be observed.

Supportive data include increased glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody titers more than 20 nmol/L, a needle electromyography with continuous motor unit activity in at least one axial muscle, and normal MRI and cerebrospinal fluid studies. Variants of SPS include those with focal limb dysfunction (stiff-limb syndrome), encephalomyelitis (\\\"SPS plus\\\"), and those associated with paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, an autoimmune etiology for SPS is proposed, based on its association with autoantibodies and other autoimmune diseases and its response to immunomodulatory therapy. The cornerstone of treatment consists of symptomatic care with benzodiazepines and/or baclofen. Other neuromodulators include antiepileptic medications and muscle relaxants. Continued disability despite first-line therapy should prompt consideration of agents aimed at immunomodulation and immunosuppression. Intravenous immunoglobulin is one of the few agents to be evaluated in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Other options include steroids, plasma exchange, and chemotherapy agents.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.11477/mf.1416201808', CITATION: 'Matsui N, Tanaka K, Izumi Y.

Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions. SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-309201', CITATION: 'Baizabal-Carvallo JF, Jankovic J. (2014) Stiff-person syndrome: insights into a complex autoimmune disorder.', CONTENT:'Stiff-person syndrome: insights into a complex autoimmune disorder.\\n\\nStiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterised by progressive rigidity and muscle spasms affecting the axial and limb muscles. Since its initial description in 1956, marked progress has been made in the clinical characterisation, understanding of pathogenesis and therapy of this disorder. SPS can be classified according to the clinical presentation into classic SPS and SPS variants: focal or segmental-SPS, jerking-SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Most patients with SPS have antibodies directed against the glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter \\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Antibodies directed against GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and the glycine-\\u03b11 receptor can also be observed. Paraneoplastic SPS is commonly associated with antiamphiphysin antibodies and breast cancer. Treatment of SPS with drugs that increase the GABAergic tone combined with immunotherapy can improve the neurological manifestations of these patients. The prognosis, however, is unpredictable and spontaneous remissions are unlikely.'},{\\n'DOI': 'doi:10.1016/j.pmrj.2018.04.007', CITATION: 'No SW, Im IK, Kim DH. (2018) Stiff Person Syndrome With Evidence of Nonspecific Focal Myositis Secondary to Sustained Muscle Contraction: A Case Report.', CONTENT:'Stiff Person Syndrome With Evidence of Nonspecific Focal Myositis Secondary to Sustained Muscle Contraction: A Case Report.\\n\\nStiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive muscular rigidity and spasms that affect axial and limb muscles. There have been a few reports that patients with SPS had evidences of polymyositis. There have been no clear explanations about the characteristics of polymyositis in SPS. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with SPS in association with nonspecific focal myositis secondary to sustained muscle contraction. She presented with stiffness and pain in her extremities, and diazepam and baclofen were ineffective. With immunotherapy, her serum creatinine kinase levels reduced; however, her clinical symptoms progressively worsened.

We describe a patient who presented with ill-defined stiffness and an exaggerated startle response, who on serial examinations had variable degrees of stiffness and marked hyperreflexia but with plantar flexor signs. Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) was considered when axial stiffness became evident and was confirmed with highly elevated anti-GAD antibody titers. A favorable response to a short course of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was sustained for more than 10 months, an unusual feature to the disease. We review the clinical features, pathologic mechanism, and treatment of this disorder.'}]\"\n",
