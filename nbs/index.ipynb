    "Alhazen is an AI agent to help human users understand what is already known. Alhazen uses tools that help you build a local **digital library** of papers, webpages, database records, etc. by querying online sources and downloading material to your hard drive. Alhazen also uses a range of tools to analyze its digital library contents to answer meaningful questions to human users. It is primarily built with the excellent [`LangChain`](https://langchain.com/) system, providing tools that use web-robots, generative AI, deep learning, ontologies and other knowledge-based technologies. It can be run using locally-running Dashboards, Jupyter Notebooks, or command-line function calls.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this work are threefold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To provide a pragmatic AI tool that helps read, summarize, and synthesize available scientific knowledge.\n",
    "2. To provide a *platform* for development of AI tools in the community. \n",
    "3. To actively develop working systems for high-value tasks within the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's programs and partnerships. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses available tools within the rapidly-expanding ecosystem of generative AI models. This includes state-of-the-art commercial  APIs (such as OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, etc) as well as open models that can be run locally (such as Llama-2, Mixtral, Smaug, Olmo, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use local models, it is recommended that Alhazen be run on a large, high end machine such as an M2 Apple Macbook with 48+GB of memory. "

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker \n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred method to run Alhazen is through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, for correct functionality, set the following environment variables for the shell from which you are calling Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "**MANDATORY**\n",
    "\n",
    "* LOCAL_FILE_PATH - the directory where the system will store full-text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OPTIONAL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* OPENAI_API_KEY - if you are using OpenAI large language models.  \n",
    "* DATABRICKS_API_KEY - if you are using the Databricks AI Playground endpoint as an LLM server. \n",
    "* GROQ_API_KEY - if you are calling LLMs on groq.com\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the system out of the box, run these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/alhazen\n",
    "$ cd alhazen\n",
    "$ docker compose build\n",
    "$ docker compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should generate the output that includes a link formatted like this one:  http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=LONG-ALPHANUMERIC-STRING. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a browser to that location and you should get access to a juypter lab notebook that provides access to all notebooks in the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browse to `nbs/tutorials/CryoET_Tutorial.ipynb` to access a walkthrough of an analysis over papers involving CryoET as a demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Huridocs as PDF extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the system with support from the [Huridocs](https://github.com/huridocs/pdf_paragraphs_extraction) PDF extraction system (needed for processing full text articles), you must first run the docker container for that system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/huridocs/pdf_paragraphs_extraction\n",
    "$ cd pdf_paragraphs_extraction\n",
    "$ docker compose build\n",
    "$ docker compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then repeat as before, but with the huridocs alhazen image\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ..\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/alhazen\n",
    "$ cd alhazen\n",
    "$ docker compose build\n",
    "$ docker compose -f docker-compose-huridocs.yml up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postgresql\n",
    "\n",
    "Alhazen requires [postgresql@14](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/) to run. Homebrew provides an installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ brew install postgresql@14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be run as a service: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ brew services start postgresql@14\n",
    "$ brew services list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install Postgresql via homebrew, you will need to create a `postgres` superuser to run the  `psql` command.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ createuser -s postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the [`Postgres.app`](https://postgresapp.com/) system also provides a nice GUI interface for Postgres but installing the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) package is a little more involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool uses the [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) library to execute large language models locally on your machine. Note that to able to run the best performing models on a Apple Mac M1 or M2 machine, you will need at least 48GB of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Huridocs\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a PDF document text extraction and classification system called [Huridocs](https://huridocs.org/). In particular, our PDF processing requires a docker image of their [PDF Paragraphs Extraction](https://github.com/huridocs/pdf_paragraphs_extraction) system. To run this, perform the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. git clone https://github.com/huridocs/pdf_paragraphs_extraction\n",
    "2. cd pdf_paragraphs_extraction\n",

    "## Where does the Name 'Alhazen' come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "One thousand years ago, Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039 AD) studied optics through experimentation and observation. He advocated that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning — an early pioneer in the scientific method _five centuries_ before Renaissance scientists started following the same paradigm ([Website](https://www.ibnalhaytham.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham), [Tbakhi & Amir 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074172/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the latinized form of his name ('Alhazen') to honor his contribution (which goes largely unrecognized from within non-Islamic communities). \n",
    "\n",
    "Famously, he was quoted as saying:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we seek to develop an AI capable of applying scientific knowledge engineering to support CZI's mission. We seek to honor Ibn al-Haytham's critical view of published knowledge by creating a AI-powered system for scientific discovery.\n",
