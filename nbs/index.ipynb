    "\n",
    "One thousand years ago, Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039 AD) studied optics through experimentation and observation. He advocated that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning—an early pioneer in the scientific method _five centuries_ before Renaissance scientists ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the latinized form of his name ('Alhazen') as the name of this project to honor his contribution (which goes largely unrecognized from within non-Islamic communities). \n",

    "Here, we seek to develop an AI capable of applying scientific knowledge engineering to support CZI's mission. \n"
