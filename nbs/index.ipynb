    "\n",
    "One thousand years ago, Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039 AD) studied optics through experimentation and observation. He advocated that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning — an early pioneer in the scientific method _five centuries_ before Renaissance scientists started following the same paradigm ([Website](https://www.ibnalhaytham.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham), [Tbakhi & Amir 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074172/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the latinized form of his name ('Alhazen') as the name of this project to honor his contribution (which goes largely unrecognized from within non-Islamic communities). \n",
    "\n",
    "Famously, he was quoted as saying:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we seek to develop an AI capable of applying scientific knowledge engineering to support CZI's mission. We seek to honor Ibn al-Haytham's critical view of published knowledge by creating a AI-powered system for scientific discovery."
